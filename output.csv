We hypothesize that exercise snacks are a feasible, well-tolerated, and time-efficient approach to improve cardiorespiratory fitness and reduce the negative impact of sedentary behavior on cardiometabolic health. Efficacy has been demonstrated in small proof-of-concept studies. Additional research should investigate this novel physical activity strategy. Brief isolated bouts of vigorous exercise — termed exercise snacks — seem to be a practical and time-efficient approach to improve cardiometabolic health. Key Points A perceived lack of time and access to facilities are commonly cited barriers to regular physical activity. Exercise snacks are isolated bouts of vigorous exercise lasting ≤1 min and performed periodically throughout the day. Recent small-scale proof-of-concept studies show that exercise snacks can improve cardiorespiratory fitness and indices of cardiometabolic health in previously inactive adults. Exercise snacks seem to be well tolerated and can also offset the detrimental effects of prolonged sitting on metabolic outcomes and vascular function. The cardiometabolic health benefits of exercise snacks are apparent using both laboratory-based cycling protocols and more practical approaches involving stair climbing, which may increase the likelihood of their adoption in a home-, office-, or school-based setting. The feasibility and time efficiency of exercise snacks make them suitable for incorporating in between activities of daily living, thereby alleviating the need for planning and allocating leisure time for structured exercise. INTRODUCTION Low cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) and sedentary behavior ( i.e. , waking behaviors characterized by an energy expenditure ≤1.5 metabolic equivalents (METs) while in a sitting or reclining posture) ( 1 ) are independently associated with increased all-cause mortality and cardiovascular disease risk ( 2,3 ). Although the detrimental effects of physical inactivity ( i.e. , achieving insufficient amounts of weekly moderate-to-vigorous physical activity) ( 1 ) are widely recognized, many individuals fail to meet current physical activity guidelines because of a perceived lack of time and barriers accessing equipment and facilities ( 4,5 ). Vigorous intermittent exercise including various interventions deemed “high-intensity” and “sprint” interval training (HIIT and SIT, respectively) can enhance CRF and other health-related markers similar to traditional moderate-intensity continuous training ( 6–9 ). Although efficacious to improve fitness and health, these protocols typically require dedicated leisure time and can be difficult to implement outside controlled laboratory settings. There also is increasing appreciation for the independent effect of sedentary behavior on cardiometabolic risk ( 3,10,11 ) and the benefits of breaking up sedentary time with more frequent bouts of activity throughout the day ( 12–14 ). The application of HIIT/SIT principles to more feasible and accessible forms of exercise that can improve CRF and simultaneously reduce the negative impacts of prolonged sedentary time offers a novel method to enhance health outcomes in the general population. One such strategy involves performing brief isolated bouts of vigorous exercise over the course of the day. This approach, called “exercise snacks,” can obviate the requirement for specialized equipment and alleviates the need for planning and allocating leisure time for structured exercise. It can be incorporated in between or structured within activities of daily living and implemented in a home, office, or school setting. An important added benefit of exercise snacks beyond their potential to improve CRF in a practical manner ( 15 ) is that they can naturally break up periods of prolonged sitting to reduce sedentary behavior and the associated health consequences ( 16 ). Several recent reports have shown that exercise snacks can boost indices of cardiometabolic health in young inactive adults ( 15–18 ). These studies have involved relatively small numbers of participants and should be classified primarily as proof-of-concept. Nonetheless, the emerging body of research highlights the potential value of exercise snacks as an additional tool in the repertoire of strategies aimed at increasing physical activity and improving cardiometabolic health among the general population. The purpose of this review is to highlight key findings from these studies to support our novel central hypothesis that exercise snacks are a feasible, well-tolerated, and time-efficient approach to improve CRF and reduce the negative impact of sedentary behavior on cardiometabolic health. WHAT ARE EXERCISE SNACKS? To our knowledge, the term “exercise snacks” was first used by Dr Howard Hartley in a 2007 weekly news magazine article ( https://www.newsweek.com/exercise-snack-plan-96095 ). A 2014 study by Francois et al. ( 19 ), which demonstrated the benefits of brief intermittent bouts of vigorous-intensity walking for glycemic control in individuals with insulin resistance, seems to be the first to use the term in a peer-reviewed article. The protocol in that original study involved an 11-min exercise session (6 × 1-min bouts with 1-min recovery periods) in addition to a 5-min warm-up and 3-min cooldown performed on three separate occasions during the day before meals ( 19 ). In contrast, more recent studies have adopted the term “exercise snacks” to describe isolated bouts of vigorous exercise lasting ≤1 min that are performed multiple times throughout the day ( 15–18 ). The brief nature of exercise bouts that correspond to the latter definition makes it challenging to gauge intensity based on most traditional metrics including percentages of maximal heart rate (HR) or maximal oxygen uptake (V˙O 2 ), which may not be sensitive enough to accurately reflect the physiological demands imposed on cardiac or skeletal muscle during short bouts of vigorous activity. A similar argument can be made against the use of the Borg rating of perceived exertion (RPE) 6–20 scale in this scenario, which, to our knowledge, has not been validated for brief isolated bouts of vigorous exercise that typify exercise snacks. Rather, for the purpose of characterizing exercise snacks, it seems most practical to gauge relative effort, which in our published articles has resulted typically in mean values close to or greater than 5 — or a “hard” effort — on the Borg category ratio 10 (CR10) scale ( 15–17 ). As such, although our focus is on studies that fit this definition, we acknowledge the health benefits conferred by other practical variations of brief activity breaks ( 12,14,20 ) and brief vigorous exercise that could align with concepts related to our definition of exercise snacks ( 19,21–25 ). THE EFFICACY OF EXERCISE SNACKS FOR IMPROVING CRF IN INACTIVE ADULTS Our first exercise snacks study ( 15 ) was developed based on previous work showing a ~1 MET improvement in CRF after a 6-wk stair climbing protocol that involved 3 × 20-s hard efforts over a 10-min period performed 3 d·wk −1 ( 26 ). In the subsequent study ( 15 ), we exposed previously inactive young adults to an intervention involving either three daily bouts of vigorous stair climbing performed 1–4 h apart on 3 d·wk −1 or a no-exercise control (n = 12 per group) ( 15 ). For each stair-based exercise snack, participants were instructed to safely ascend 60 steps in a three-flight stairwell as quickly as possible. Each exercise snack was preceded by a dynamic warm-up (10 jumping jacks, 10 air squats, and 5 lunges on each side) and followed by a 1-min walking cooldown. After the 6-wk intervention, there were modest, albeit significant, improvements in CRF as measured using cycling V˙O 2peak and peak power output in the exercise snacks group as compared with control ( 15 ). CRF and peak power output values in the exercise snacks group were ~5% and ~12% higher postintervention, respectively, as compared with baseline. Of note, the vigorous exercise snacks elicited mean RPE values corresponding to a “hard” effort (5 ± 1 on the Borg CR10 scale) and mean HR responses equating ~85% of the age-predicted maximum over the course of the training intervention ( 15 ). The potential for exercise snacks to improve CRF ( 15 ) was confirmed in a study involving three isolated 20-s “all-out” cycling bouts (each with a 2-min warm-up and 1-min cooldown) performed 1–4 h apart ( 17 ). V˙O 2peak and time-trial performance improved by ~4% and ~9%, respectively, over a 6-wk period in a group of 12 inactive adults ( 17 ). The CRF and performance gains with cycling-based exercise snacks seemed to be similar in magnitude to those observed in participants who were randomized to a traditional SIT protocol in this study, although the study was admittedly underpowered for between-group comparisons ( Fig. 1 ). These results suggest that the vigorous nature of these protocols may be a more important adaptive stimulus than performing successive bouts of fatiguing exercise within a short period. In support of this supposition, an isolated 10-s sprint is sufficient to alter the concentration of intramuscular metabolites ( 27 ), and a 30-s sprint activates key intracellular signaling cascades involved in mediating training adaptation ( e.g. , adenosine monophosphate (AMP)–activated protein kinase) ( 28 ). These findings extended earlier work in 18 middle-aged females demonstrating a ~14% improvement in V˙O 2peak when three isolated 30-s Wingate tests undertaken 4 h apart were performed thrice weekly over an 8-wk period ( 29 ). Figure 1: Equipotency of laboratory-based exercise snacks (3 × 20-s isolated bouts of all-out cycling performed 1–4 h apart) and traditional sprint interval training (3 × 20-s all-out bouts interspersed with 3-min rest within a 10-min exercise session) for improving peak oxygen uptake (A), peak power output (B), and 150-kJ cycling time-trial performance (C) in sedentary young adults over a 6-wk intervention. *Significant main effect of time.

Taken together, evidence gleaned from the aforementioned studies suggests that vigorous exercise snacks are an effective strategy to improve CRF and indices of exercise performance in previously inactive adults. Despite participants in our studies still being considered physically inactive based on the recently revised Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans ( i.e. , by completing exercise snacks, they would not necessarily achieve 150 min of moderate-intensity or 75 min of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity, or an equivalent combination of both each week ( 30 )), the CRF gains conferred by the exercise snacks approach would still be expected to have health benefits ( 2 ). Importantly, for the adoption of exercise snacks by the general population outside the laboratory, the CRF gains attained using the exercise snacks approach do not require all-out efforts ( 15 ) and are apparent using both cycling-based exercise snacks and a more practical stair-based snack protocol that can be easily implemented in a home-, school-, or office-based setting. THE FEASIBILITY OF EXERCISE SNACKS IN PRECLINICAL AND CLINICAL POPULATIONS Sedentary behavior is linked to adverse metabolic outcomes independent of CRF and physical activity levels ( 3,10,11 ), and evidence from both observational and interventional studies supports the health benefits of interrupting sedentary time with bouts of low- to moderate-intensity physical activity such as walking ( 12–14 ). Although these strategies effectively mitigate the cardiometabolic health defects arising from sedentary behavior, practical lifestyle approaches that break up prolonged periods of inactivity while simultaneously improving in CRF in populations at risk for, or diagnosed with, cardiometabolic disease ( e.g. , type 2 diabetes, coronary artery disease) are presently limited. Relatedly, a large proportion of individuals in this demographic are elderly and have low physical fitness levels or other disease-related risk factors that may prevent participation in traditional forms of exercise that are typically well suited for healthy adults. Thus, there is an urgent need for feasible exercise strategies that can effectively improve cardiometabolic health in these populations. Recent work from our laboratory supports the feasibility and efficacy of vigorous exercise snacks to disrupt prolonged periods of inactivity and improve cardiometabolic health markers in preclinical and clinical populations. Using a randomized crossover design, we demonstrated that breaking up 9 h of sitting with hourly bouts of vigorous stair-based exercise snacks (~15–30 s) significantly reduced the area under the curve for insulin by ~17% and nonesterified fatty acids by ~21% in 11 adults with overweight/obesity ( Fig. 2 ) ( 16 ). Unlike our previous studies ( 15,17 ), we opted not to include a warm-up and cooldown in this study to capture what an exercise snack may look like in the real world. These preliminary findings are reinforced by a recent study from Wolfe et al. ( 31 ) that reported improvements in some measures of metabolic control when 8 h of continuous sitting was compared with a condition where participants performed 5 × 4-second maximal cycling sprints on a specialized ergometer, once per hour. Breaking up prolonged sitting with hourly sprints resulted in a ~31% reduction in postprandial plasma triglycerides and 43% increase in fat oxidation after the consumption of a high-fat meal on the morning after the experimental trial ( 31 ). The exercise protocol was not strictly an exercise snacks study per our definition here, however, because it involved a total of 20 s of maximal intensity cycling over ~4–5 min once per hour. Other reports also show the feasibility of short practical bouts of stair-based vigorous exercise in individuals with type 2 diabetes ( 32 ) and coronary artery disease ( 33,34 ), and research into the potential of exercise snacks for improving metabolic outcomes in clinical populations represents a promising avenue for future work. It will also be of interest to examine how the more vigorous exercise snacks approach discussed here compares to breaking up prolonged sitting with frequent light- to moderate-activity breaks — an approach that has previously demonstrated benefits for improving markers of metabolic control in individuals with obesity and type 2 diabetes ( 12,14,20,35 ).

THE POTENTIAL FOR EXERCISE SNACKS TO IMPROVE VASCULAR HEALTH In addition to causing metabolic disruptions, prolonged sitting also reduces leg blood flow and shear stress — factors implicated in endothelial dysfunction and the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease ( 36,37 ). The detrimental effects of sedentary behavior on vascular function can be mitigated when exercise is undertaken before ( 38 ), during ( 39 ), or immediately after ( 40 ) an extended bout of prolonged sitting. In this regard, recent work from our laboratory also supports the potential for exercise snacks to improve vascular function during extended periods of sitting. Caldwell et al. ( 18 ) exposed 10 healthy males to ~8.5 h of sitting with or without hourly stair-based exercise snacks involving ~14–20 s of ascending three flights of stairs at a brisk speed. Significant improvements in femoral artery hemodynamics, but not flow-mediated dilation (FMD), were apparent when prolonged sitting was interrupted with hourly exercise snacks, as reflected by ~32% higher blood flow and vascular conductance and a ~15% increase in shear rate ( 18 ) ( Fig. 3 ). Although we are unaware of other studies examining vascular function in response to the exercise snacks approach as defined here, our work is supported by recent observations of improved popliteal artery blood flow and shear rate in healthy adults when a postprandial 4-h sitting period is interrupted with hourly 5-min bouts of vigorous stair climbing ( 23 ). Notably, the longer stair climbing bouts used by Cho et al. ( 23 ) also offset the reduction in FMD during prolonged sitting, suggesting that longer acute bouts of exercise may be required to elicit favorable effects on this parameter of vascular function. Taken together, these findings support the potential of exercise snacks to favorably impact vascular health, although additional studies are required to confirm the findings presented here, particularly with regard to the effects of exercise snacks on vascular and endothelial function. Figure 3: Breaking up ~8.5 h of sitting with hourly stair-based exercise snacks (~14–20 s) improve some (but not all) indices of leg vascular function during ~8.5 h of sitting in 10 healthy young males.

Exercise snacks align with the recently revised Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans and the World Health Organization (WHO) Guidelines on Physical Activity and Sedentary Behavior ( 30,41 ). In recognition of the potential health benefits of short bouts of physical activity, the updated recommendations from these and other organizations eliminated the previous requirement that physical activity had to be accumulated in bouts lasting at least 10-min minimum ( 30,41 ). In line with this recommendation, other work has demonstrated the maintenance of health benefits when splitting longer sessions of continuous exercise into shorter bouts dispersed over the course of the day ( 42 ). Stamatakis et al. ( 43 ) recently proposed a framework encouraging four pillars of research to better understand the health benefits of a strategy called “vigorous intermittent lifestyle physical activity” (VILPA). These authors define VILPA as a single session of vigorous activity (≥14 or 15 on the Borg 6–20 scale or >6 MET) lasting no more than 5 min performed as part of activities of daily living or other lifestyle physical activities ( 43 ). Exercise snacks align closely with the VILPA framework in terms of their brevity, intensity, and accessibility but are technically distinct. First, unlike VILPA, exercise snacks are not purely incidental to, or inherently part of, activities of daily living but rather can be planned or structured within lifestyle activities — a distinction that still preserves the important aspects of feasibility and accessibility upon which VILPA is based. Exercise snacks also embody key elements of exercise that are not necessarily part of VILPA — namely, structure (≤1 min in duration and performed as a hard effort), planning (required some anticipation or decision making), repetition (must be performed multiple times over the day), and intention (performed for the improvement of cardiometabolic health) — further distinguishing them from the VILPA approach. Nonetheless, it becomes somewhat difficult to delineate between a purposeful exercise snack embedded within activities of daily living — for instance, vigorously ascending the stairs to use the restroom on a different floor in an office building or performing a set of jumping jacks during a break between virtual meetings — and lifestyle approaches such as incidental VILPA ( e.g. , carrying groceries up several flights of stairs, maximizing walking pace to the bus stop). Relatedly, although exercise snacks are sometimes compared as a more practical alternative to SIT ( 17 ), the health benefits of exercise snacks do not require “all out” efforts and can be achieved without the use of specialized cycle ergometers ( 15,16,18 ) — both of which are typical components of traditional SIT protocols. As such, we believe it is most appropriate to classify exercise snacks as a distinct subset of brief vigorous exercise ( 6 ), but we also recognize that — as with most things in science — the concept of exercise snacks proposed here is not necessarily new but rather may be an alternative iteration of an idea that has likely been presented by others in different contexts, both in the past and present. FUTURE DIRECTIONS We have proposed a working definition of exercise snacks based on the existing literature, but also recognize the need to balance establishing a more standardized definition with the pragmaticism of avoiding hard cutoffs that draw the line at distinct intensities, durations, or numbers of isolated, short bouts of exercise within the exercise snacking concept. Ultimately, our intention is not to advocate for strictly defined terminology but rather to highlight the overall concept that isolated bouts of brief vigorous exercise represent an additional lifestyle approach to improve cardiometabolic health. With this in mind, it is entirely possible that others may view this approach as a physical activity strategy as opposed to an exercise protocol per se and, thus, choose to use terminology that differs from that implemented here ( e.g. , activity snacks). The decision to use the term “exercise” (as opposed to “activity”) snacks for the purpose of this article was to maintain consistency with our published work in the area and because the approach presented in this article embodies key aspects of exercise in that it is planned, structured, repetitive, and intended for the purpose of improving cardiometabolic health. Other researchers have used variations of the term “exercise snacks” to describe protocols that deviate slightly from our proposed definition but still may yield important benefits for cardiometabolic health ( 19,24,44 ). As such, the exact characteristics of exercise snacks required to maximize health benefits are yet to be determined, but it does seem that a single isolated daily 20-s sprint may not be sufficient to increase CRF in young healthy adults ( 45 ). A standardized definition could also help better understand this novel exercise approach given the similarities between exercise snacks and other forms of brief vigorous activity such as VILPA or low-volume SIT ( 6,43,46 ). However, characterizing the intensity, duration, or mode of exercise snacks based on established exercise prescription guidelines ( e.g. , American College of Sports Medicine, WHO) and principles ( e.g. , “FITT”) becomes difficult because of the short-duration, purposefully sporadic and isolated nature of this type of activity. For instance, it is possible that, when evaluating intensity using traditional metrics such as RPE, HR, or V˙O 2 , exercise snacks may elicit values that are distinct from those observed during more common types of activity that established exercise prescription guidelines are based on. Thus, we encourage future attempts to classify exercise snacks in a manner that distinguishes them from existing physical activity and exercise paradigms and call for research validating traditional metrics for characterizing this type of activity. Another aspect that is missing from the existing exercise snacks literature is their impact on psychological and affective responses, as these behavioral factors may be among the most important determinants of exercise participation. Little et al. ( 17 ) found no impact on exercise enjoyment after 6 wk of laboratory-based exercise snacks, but participants indicated the desire to perform exercise snacks in a “real-world” setting. This again highlights the need to examine both physiological and psychological responses to exercise snacks outside the laboratory. In general, stair-based brief vigorous exercise seems to elicit favorable effects on cognition and mood in healthy young adults ( 47 ), but whether these beneficial effects persist using the exercise snacks approach as defined here remains to be determined. On a related note, qualitative measures that capture the feasibility of this approach in a setting where participants may not have adequate time or opportunity to prepare for intense activity during daily activities ( e.g. , by warming up or changing into active wear) should be assessed to rule out potential barriers to exercise snacks in the real world. Given the relatively short duration and laboratory-based nature of existing exercise snacks studies, another important next step is to investigate the physiological and behavioral responses to longer exercise snacks interventions ( e.g. , several months to >1 year). Relatedly, as most of the existing research has involved healthy individuals, future studies should include populations at risk for cardiometabolic disease ( e.g. , preclinical/clinical populations, elderly individuals) to assess comprehensively the feasibility and efficacy of the exercise snacks approach. A plausible concern with the implementation of any vigorous exercise strategy in the real world is the potential of injury — particularly in at-risk or elderly populations. This highlights another outcome that should be addressed when attempting to translate exercise snacks outside the laboratory, albeit in a manner that balances the potential risk of injury with the numerous health benefits highlighted here and the detrimental effects of inactivity itself. Lastly, the aerobically conditioning nature of the exercise snacks in the studies discussed here favor improvements in CRF, but the exercise snacks approach may be additionally attractive if geared toward improving muscular strength and endurance. A pilot study by Perkin et al. ( 24 ) reported improvements in functional capacity (sit to stand score) in older adults who participated in a 28-d home-based intervention involving two daily bouts of body weight exercise involving 5 × 1-min bouts of maximum repetitions. At the molecular level, brief vigorous bouts of stair climbing improved fiber-specific satellite cell content and myonuclei number as well as indices of capillarization in patients with coronary artery disease over a 12-wk period ( 33 ). However, because neither of these studies involved isolated bouts of exercise using an exercise snacks approach, whether these changes in muscle function and phenotype would manifest in response to exercise snacks requires confirmation in future work. Future research also should probe the mechanistic basis of the adaptive response to exercise snacks, which — similar to other forms of brief vigorous exercise — likely involves muscular oxidative remodeling mediated by activation of canonical intracellular signaling pathways ( e.g. , AMP-activated protein kinase) and transcriptional regulators ( e.g. , peroxisome proliferative activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha) ( 48–50 ). CONCLUSIONS The persistence of insufficient physical activity levels and sedentary lifestyles among the general population in modern Western societies highlights the ongoing need for feasible exercise strategies that simultaneously improve CRF and reduce the impact of sedentariness on cardiometabolic health. Based on the emerging evidence presented in this article, we propose that exercise snacks — defined here as isolated bouts of brief vigorous exercise performed multiple times throughout the day — may be one such strategy ( Fig. 4 ). Exercise snacks involving thrice daily ~15–30 s of hard effort involving cycling and more practical stair climbing are efficacious for improving CRF and exercise performance in inactive adults. Exercise snacks may also have potential to improve aspects of cardiometabolic health in individuals with obesity, but their efficacy in clinical populations remains to be established as existing reports have studied a small number of participants in laboratory-based settings. Relatedly — and perhaps most importantly — the applicability of exercise snacks in a “real-world” ( e.g. , in home-, office-, or work-based) setting and the potential for exercise snacks to target musculoskeletal health remain to be determined. Figure 4: Exercise snacks — brief isolated bouts of vigorous exercise performed over the course of the day — represent a feasible, well-tolerated, and time-efficient strategy to simultaneously improve cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) and reduce the detrimental impact of prolonged sedentary behavior on cardiometabolic health (created with BioRender.com ).

We hypothesize that exercise snacks are a feasible, well-tolerated, and time-efficient approach to improve cardiorespiratory fitness and reduce the negative impact of sedentary behavior on cardiometabolic health. Efficacy has been demonstrated in small proof-of-concept studies. Additional research should investigate this novel physical activity strategy. Brief isolated bouts of vigorous exercise — termed exercise snacks — seem to be a practical and time-efficient approach to improve cardiometabolic health. Key Points A perceived lack of time and access to facilities are commonly cited barriers to regular physical activity. Exercise snacks are isolated bouts of vigorous exercise lasting ≤1 min and performed periodically throughout the day. Recent small-scale proof-of-concept studies show that exercise snacks can improve cardiorespiratory fitness and indices of cardiometabolic health in previously inactive adults. Exercise snacks seem to be well tolerated and can also offset the detrimental effects of prolonged sitting on metabolic outcomes and vascular function. The cardiometabolic health benefits of exercise snacks are apparent using both laboratory-based cycling protocols and more practical approaches involving stair climbing, which may increase the likelihood of their adoption in a home-, office-, or school-based setting. The feasibility and time efficiency of exercise snacks make them suitable for incorporating in between activities of daily living, thereby alleviating the need for planning and allocating leisure time for structured exercise. INTRODUCTION Low cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) and sedentary behavior ( i.e. , waking behaviors characterized by an energy expenditure ≤1.5 metabolic equivalents (METs) while in a sitting or reclining posture) ( 1 ) are independently associated with increased all-cause mortality and cardiovascular disease risk ( 2,3 ). Although the detrimental effects of physical inactivity ( i.e. , achieving insufficient amounts of weekly moderate-to-vigorous physical activity) ( 1 ) are widely recognized, many individuals fail to meet current physical activity guidelines because of a perceived lack of time and barriers accessing equipment and facilities ( 4,5 ). Vigorous intermittent exercise including various interventions deemed “high-intensity” and “sprint” interval training (HIIT and SIT, respectively) can enhance CRF and other health-related markers similar to traditional moderate-intensity continuous training ( 6–9 ). Although efficacious to improve fitness and health, these protocols typically require dedicated leisure time and can be difficult to implement outside controlled laboratory settings. There also is increasing appreciation for the independent effect of sedentary behavior on cardiometabolic risk ( 3,10,11 ) and the benefits of breaking up sedentary time with more frequent bouts of activity throughout the day ( 12–14 ). The application of HIIT/SIT principles to more feasible and accessible forms of exercise that can improve CRF and simultaneously reduce the negative impacts of prolonged sedentary time offers a novel method to enhance health outcomes in the general population. One such strategy involves performing brief isolated bouts of vigorous exercise over the course of the day. This approach, called “exercise snacks,” can obviate the requirement for specialized equipment and alleviates the need for planning and allocating leisure time for structured exercise. It can be incorporated in between or structured within activities of daily living and implemented in a home, office, or school setting. An important added benefit of exercise snacks beyond their potential to improve CRF in a practical manner ( 15 ) is that they can naturally break up periods of prolonged sitting to reduce sedentary behavior and the associated health consequences ( 16 ). Several recent reports have shown that exercise snacks can boost indices of cardiometabolic health in young inactive adults ( 15–18 ). These studies have involved relatively small numbers of participants and should be classified primarily as proof-of-concept. Nonetheless, the emerging body of research highlights the potential value of exercise snacks as an additional tool in the repertoire of strategies aimed at increasing physical activity and improving cardiometabolic health among the general population. The purpose of this review is to highlight key findings from these studies to support our novel central hypothesis that exercise snacks are a feasible, well-tolerated, and time-efficient approach to improve CRF and reduce the negative impact of sedentary behavior on cardiometabolic health. WHAT ARE EXERCISE SNACKS? To our knowledge, the term “exercise snacks” was first used by Dr Howard Hartley in a 2007 weekly news magazine article ( https://www.newsweek.com/exercise-snack-plan-96095 ). A 2014 study by Francois et al. ( 19 ), which demonstrated the benefits of brief intermittent bouts of vigorous-intensity walking for glycemic control in individuals with insulin resistance, seems to be the first to use the term in a peer-reviewed article. The protocol in that original study involved an 11-min exercise session (6 × 1-min bouts with 1-min recovery periods) in addition to a 5-min warm-up and 3-min cooldown performed on three separate occasions during the day before meals ( 19 ). In contrast, more recent studies have adopted the term “exercise snacks” to describe isolated bouts of vigorous exercise lasting ≤1 min that are performed multiple times throughout the day ( 15–18 ). The brief nature of exercise bouts that correspond to the latter definition makes it challenging to gauge intensity based on most traditional metrics including percentages of maximal heart rate (HR) or maximal oxygen uptake (V˙O 2 ), which may not be sensitive enough to accurately reflect the physiological demands imposed on cardiac or skeletal muscle during short bouts of vigorous activity. A similar argument can be made against the use of the Borg rating of perceived exertion (RPE) 6–20 scale in this scenario, which, to our knowledge, has not been validated for brief isolated bouts of vigorous exercise that typify exercise snacks. Rather, for the purpose of characterizing exercise snacks, it seems most practical to gauge relative effort, which in our published articles has resulted typically in mean values close to or greater than 5 — or a “hard” effort — on the Borg category ratio 10 (CR10) scale ( 15–17 ). As such, although our focus is on studies that fit this definition, we acknowledge the health benefits conferred by other practical variations of brief activity breaks ( 12,14,20 ) and brief vigorous exercise that could align with concepts related to our definition of exercise snacks ( 19,21–25 ). THE EFFICACY OF EXERCISE SNACKS FOR IMPROVING CRF IN INACTIVE ADULTS Our first exercise snacks study ( 15 ) was developed based on previous work showing a ~1 MET improvement in CRF after a 6-wk stair climbing protocol that involved 3 × 20-s hard efforts over a 10-min period performed 3 d·wk −1 ( 26 ). In the subsequent study ( 15 ), we exposed previously inactive young adults to an intervention involving either three daily bouts of vigorous stair climbing performed 1–4 h apart on 3 d·wk −1 or a no-exercise control (n = 12 per group) ( 15 ). For each stair-based exercise snack, participants were instructed to safely ascend 60 steps in a three-flight stairwell as quickly as possible. Each exercise snack was preceded by a dynamic warm-up (10 jumping jacks, 10 air squats, and 5 lunges on each side) and followed by a 1-min walking cooldown. After the 6-wk intervention, there were modest, albeit significant, improvements in CRF as measured using cycling V˙O 2peak and peak power output in the exercise snacks group as compared with control ( 15 ). CRF and peak power output values in the exercise snacks group were ~5% and ~12% higher postintervention, respectively, as compared with baseline. Of note, the vigorous exercise snacks elicited mean RPE values corresponding to a “hard” effort (5 ± 1 on the Borg CR10 scale) and mean HR responses equating ~85% of the age-predicted maximum over the course of the training intervention ( 15 ). The potential for exercise snacks to improve CRF ( 15 ) was confirmed in a study involving three isolated 20-s “all-out” cycling bouts (each with a 2-min warm-up and 1-min cooldown) performed 1–4 h apart ( 17 ). V˙O 2peak and time-trial performance improved by ~4% and ~9%, respectively, over a 6-wk period in a group of 12 inactive adults ( 17 ). The CRF and performance gains with cycling-based exercise snacks seemed to be similar in magnitude to those observed in participants who were randomized to a traditional SIT protocol in this study, although the study was admittedly underpowered for between-group comparisons ( Fig. 1 ). These results suggest that the vigorous nature of these protocols may be a more important adaptive stimulus than performing successive bouts of fatiguing exercise within a short period. In support of this supposition, an isolated 10-s sprint is sufficient to alter the concentration of intramuscular metabolites ( 27 ), and a 30-s sprint activates key intracellular signaling cascades involved in mediating training adaptation ( e.g. , adenosine monophosphate (AMP)–activated protein kinase) ( 28 ). These findings extended earlier work in 18 middle-aged females demonstrating a ~14% improvement in V˙O 2peak when three isolated 30-s Wingate tests undertaken 4 h apart were performed thrice weekly over an 8-wk period ( 29 ). Figure 1: Equipotency of laboratory-based exercise snacks (3 × 20-s isolated bouts of all-out cycling performed 1–4 h apart) and traditional sprint interval training (3 × 20-s all-out bouts interspersed with 3-min rest within a 10-min exercise session) for improving peak oxygen uptake (A), peak power output (B), and 150-kJ cycling time-trial performance (C) in sedentary young adults over a 6-wk intervention. *Significant main effect of time.

Taken together, evidence gleaned from the aforementioned studies suggests that vigorous exercise snacks are an effective strategy to improve CRF and indices of exercise performance in previously inactive adults. Despite participants in our studies still being considered physically inactive based on the recently revised Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans ( i.e. , by completing exercise snacks, they would not necessarily achieve 150 min of moderate-intensity or 75 min of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity, or an equivalent combination of both each week ( 30 )), the CRF gains conferred by the exercise snacks approach would still be expected to have health benefits ( 2 ). Importantly, for the adoption of exercise snacks by the general population outside the laboratory, the CRF gains attained using the exercise snacks approach do not require all-out efforts ( 15 ) and are apparent using both cycling-based exercise snacks and a more practical stair-based snack protocol that can be easily implemented in a home-, school-, or office-based setting. THE FEASIBILITY OF EXERCISE SNACKS IN PRECLINICAL AND CLINICAL POPULATIONS Sedentary behavior is linked to adverse metabolic outcomes independent of CRF and physical activity levels ( 3,10,11 ), and evidence from both observational and interventional studies supports the health benefits of interrupting sedentary time with bouts of low- to moderate-intensity physical activity such as walking ( 12–14 ). Although these strategies effectively mitigate the cardiometabolic health defects arising from sedentary behavior, practical lifestyle approaches that break up prolonged periods of inactivity while simultaneously improving in CRF in populations at risk for, or diagnosed with, cardiometabolic disease ( e.g. , type 2 diabetes, coronary artery disease) are presently limited. Relatedly, a large proportion of individuals in this demographic are elderly and have low physical fitness levels or other disease-related risk factors that may prevent participation in traditional forms of exercise that are typically well suited for healthy adults. Thus, there is an urgent need for feasible exercise strategies that can effectively improve cardiometabolic health in these populations. Recent work from our laboratory supports the feasibility and efficacy of vigorous exercise snacks to disrupt prolonged periods of inactivity and improve cardiometabolic health markers in preclinical and clinical populations. Using a randomized crossover design, we demonstrated that breaking up 9 h of sitting with hourly bouts of vigorous stair-based exercise snacks (~15–30 s) significantly reduced the area under the curve for insulin by ~17% and nonesterified fatty acids by ~21% in 11 adults with overweight/obesity ( Fig. 2 ) ( 16 ). Unlike our previous studies ( 15,17 ), we opted not to include a warm-up and cooldown in this study to capture what an exercise snack may look like in the real world. These preliminary findings are reinforced by a recent study from Wolfe et al. ( 31 ) that reported improvements in some measures of metabolic control when 8 h of continuous sitting was compared with a condition where participants performed 5 × 4-second maximal cycling sprints on a specialized ergometer, once per hour. Breaking up prolonged sitting with hourly sprints resulted in a ~31% reduction in postprandial plasma triglycerides and 43% increase in fat oxidation after the consumption of a high-fat meal on the morning after the experimental trial ( 31 ). The exercise protocol was not strictly an exercise snacks study per our definition here, however, because it involved a total of 20 s of maximal intensity cycling over ~4–5 min once per hour. Other reports also show the feasibility of short practical bouts of stair-based vigorous exercise in individuals with type 2 diabetes ( 32 ) and coronary artery disease ( 33,34 ), and research into the potential of exercise snacks for improving metabolic outcomes in clinical populations represents a promising avenue for future work. It will also be of interest to examine how the more vigorous exercise snacks approach discussed here compares to breaking up prolonged sitting with frequent light- to moderate-activity breaks — an approach that has previously demonstrated benefits for improving markers of metabolic control in individuals with obesity and type 2 diabetes ( 12,14,20,35 ). Figure 2: Hourly bouts of stair-based exercise snacks (~15–30 s) improve blood insulinemia (A) and lipidemia (B) in 11 adults with overweight and obesity as compared with 9-h of uninterrupted sitting.

THE POTENTIAL FOR EXERCISE SNACKS TO IMPROVE VASCULAR HEALTH In addition to causing metabolic disruptions, prolonged sitting also reduces leg blood flow and shear stress — factors implicated in endothelial dysfunction and the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease ( 36,37 ). The detrimental effects of sedentary behavior on vascular function can be mitigated when exercise is undertaken before ( 38 ), during ( 39 ), or immediately after ( 40 ) an extended bout of prolonged sitting. In this regard, recent work from our laboratory also supports the potential for exercise snacks to improve vascular function during extended periods of sitting. Caldwell et al. ( 18 ) exposed 10 healthy males to ~8.5 h of sitting with or without hourly stair-based exercise snacks involving ~14–20 s of ascending three flights of stairs at a brisk speed. Significant improvements in femoral artery hemodynamics, but not flow-mediated dilation (FMD), were apparent when prolonged sitting was interrupted with hourly exercise snacks, as reflected by ~32% higher blood flow and vascular conductance and a ~15% increase in shear rate ( 18 ) ( Fig. 3 ). Although we are unaware of other studies examining vascular function in response to the exercise snacks approach as defined here, our work is supported by recent observations of improved popliteal artery blood flow and shear rate in healthy adults when a postprandial 4-h sitting period is interrupted with hourly 5-min bouts of vigorous stair climbing ( 23 ). Notably, the longer stair climbing bouts used by Cho et al. ( 23 ) also offset the reduction in FMD during prolonged sitting, suggesting that longer acute bouts of exercise may be required to elicit favorable effects on this parameter of vascular function. Taken together, these findings support the potential of exercise snacks to favorably impact vascular health, although additional studies are required to confirm the findings presented here, particularly with regard to the effects of exercise snacks on vascular and endothelial function.

Exercise snacks align with the recently revised Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans and the World Health Organization (WHO) Guidelines on Physical Activity and Sedentary Behavior ( 30,41 ). In recognition of the potential health benefits of short bouts of physical activity, the updated recommendations from these and other organizations eliminated the previous requirement that physical activity had to be accumulated in bouts lasting at least 10-min minimum ( 30,41 ). In line with this recommendation, other work has demonstrated the maintenance of health benefits when splitting longer sessions of continuous exercise into shorter bouts dispersed over the course of the day ( 42 ). Stamatakis et al. ( 43 ) recently proposed a framework encouraging four pillars of research to better understand the health benefits of a strategy called “vigorous intermittent lifestyle physical activity” (VILPA). These authors define VILPA as a single session of vigorous activity (≥14 or 15 on the Borg 6–20 scale or >6 MET) lasting no more than 5 min performed as part of activities of daily living or other lifestyle physical activities ( 43 ). Exercise snacks align closely with the VILPA framework in terms of their brevity, intensity, and accessibility but are technically distinct. First, unlike VILPA, exercise snacks are not purely incidental to, or inherently part of, activities of daily living but rather can be planned or structured within lifestyle activities — a distinction that still preserves the important aspects of feasibility and accessibility upon which VILPA is based. Exercise snacks also embody key elements of exercise that are not necessarily part of VILPA — namely, structure (≤1 min in duration and performed as a hard effort), planning (required some anticipation or decision making), repetition (must be performed multiple times over the day), and intention (performed for the improvement of cardiometabolic health) — further distinguishing them from the VILPA approach. Nonetheless, it becomes somewhat difficult to delineate between a purposeful exercise snack embedded within activities of daily living — for instance, vigorously ascending the stairs to use the restroom on a different floor in an office building or performing a set of jumping jacks during a break between virtual meetings — and lifestyle approaches such as incidental VILPA ( e.g. , carrying groceries up several flights of stairs, maximizing walking pace to the bus stop). Relatedly, although exercise snacks are sometimes compared as a more practical alternative to SIT ( 17 ), the health benefits of exercise snacks do not require “all out” efforts and can be achieved without the use of specialized cycle ergometers ( 15,16,18 ) — both of which are typical components of traditional SIT protocols. As such, we believe it is most appropriate to classify exercise snacks as a distinct subset of brief vigorous exercise ( 6 ), but we also recognize that — as with most things in science — the concept of exercise snacks proposed here is not necessarily new but rather may be an alternative iteration of an idea that has likely been presented by others in different contexts, both in the past and present. FUTURE DIRECTIONS We have proposed a working definition of exercise snacks based on the existing literature, but also recognize the need to balance establishing a more standardized definition with the pragmaticism of avoiding hard cutoffs that draw the line at distinct intensities, durations, or numbers of isolated, short bouts of exercise within the exercise snacking concept. Ultimately, our intention is not to advocate for strictly defined terminology but rather to highlight the overall concept that isolated bouts of brief vigorous exercise represent an additional lifestyle approach to improve cardiometabolic health. With this in mind, it is entirely possible that others may view this approach as a physical activity strategy as opposed to an exercise protocol per se and, thus, choose to use terminology that differs from that implemented here ( e.g. , activity snacks). The decision to use the term “exercise” (as opposed to “activity”) snacks for the purpose of this article was to maintain consistency with our published work in the area and because the approach presented in this article embodies key aspects of exercise in that it is planned, structured, repetitive, and intended for the purpose of improving cardiometabolic health. Other researchers have used variations of the term “exercise snacks” to describe protocols that deviate slightly from our proposed definition but still may yield important benefits for cardiometabolic health ( 19,24,44 ). As such, the exact characteristics of exercise snacks required to maximize health benefits are yet to be determined, but it does seem that a single isolated daily 20-s sprint may not be sufficient to increase CRF in young healthy adults ( 45 ). A standardized definition could also help better understand this novel exercise approach given the similarities between exercise snacks and other forms of brief vigorous activity such as VILPA or low-volume SIT ( 6,43,46 ). However, characterizing the intensity, duration, or mode of exercise snacks based on established exercise prescription guidelines ( e.g. , American College of Sports Medicine, WHO) and principles ( e.g. , “FITT”) becomes difficult because of the short-duration, purposefully sporadic and isolated nature of this type of activity. For instance, it is possible that, when evaluating intensity using traditional metrics such as RPE, HR, or V˙O 2 , exercise snacks may elicit values that are distinct from those observed during more common types of activity that established exercise prescription guidelines are based on. Thus, we encourage future attempts to classify exercise snacks in a manner that distinguishes them from existing physical activity and exercise paradigms and call for research validating traditional metrics for characterizing this type of activity. Another aspect that is missing from the existing exercise snacks literature is their impact on psychological and affective responses, as these behavioral factors may be among the most important determinants of exercise participation. Little et al. ( 17 ) found no impact on exercise enjoyment after 6 wk of laboratory-based exercise snacks, but participants indicated the desire to perform exercise snacks in a “real-world” setting. This again highlights the need to examine both physiological and psychological responses to exercise snacks outside the laboratory. In general, stair-based brief vigorous exercise seems to elicit favorable effects on cognition and mood in healthy young adults ( 47 ), but whether these beneficial effects persist using the exercise snacks approach as defined here remains to be determined. On a related note, qualitative measures that capture the feasibility of this approach in a setting where participants may not have adequate time or opportunity to prepare for intense activity during daily activities ( e.g. , by warming up or changing into active wear) should be assessed to rule out potential barriers to exercise snacks in the real world. Given the relatively short duration and laboratory-based nature of existing exercise snacks studies, another important next step is to investigate the physiological and behavioral responses to longer exercise snacks interventions ( e.g. , several months to >1 year). Relatedly, as most of the existing research has involved healthy individuals, future studies should include populations at risk for cardiometabolic disease ( e.g. , preclinical/clinical populations, elderly individuals) to assess comprehensively the feasibility and efficacy of the exercise snacks approach. A plausible concern with the implementation of any vigorous exercise strategy in the real world is the potential of injury — particularly in at-risk or elderly populations. This highlights another outcome that should be addressed when attempting to translate exercise snacks outside the laboratory, albeit in a manner that balances the potential risk of injury with the numerous health benefits highlighted here and the detrimental effects of inactivity itself. Lastly, the aerobically conditioning nature of the exercise snacks in the studies discussed here favor improvements in CRF, but the exercise snacks approach may be additionally attractive if geared toward improving muscular strength and endurance. A pilot study by Perkin et al. ( 24 ) reported improvements in functional capacity (sit to stand score) in older adults who participated in a 28-d home-based intervention involving two daily bouts of body weight exercise involving 5 × 1-min bouts of maximum repetitions. At the molecular level, brief vigorous bouts of stair climbing improved fiber-specific satellite cell content and myonuclei number as well as indices of capillarization in patients with coronary artery disease over a 12-wk period ( 33 ). However, because neither of these studies involved isolated bouts of exercise using an exercise snacks approach, whether these changes in muscle function and phenotype would manifest in response to exercise snacks requires confirmation in future work. Future research also should probe the mechanistic basis of the adaptive response to exercise snacks, which — similar to other forms of brief vigorous exercise — likely involves muscular oxidative remodeling mediated by activation of canonical intracellular signaling pathways ( e.g. , AMP-activated protein kinase) and transcriptional regulators ( e.g. , peroxisome proliferative activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha) ( 48–50 ). CONCLUSIONS The persistence of insufficient physical activity levels and sedentary lifestyles among the general population in modern Western societies highlights the ongoing need for feasible exercise strategies that simultaneously improve CRF and reduce the impact of sedentariness on cardiometabolic health. Based on the emerging evidence presented in this article, we propose that exercise snacks — defined here as isolated bouts of brief vigorous exercise performed multiple times throughout the day — may be one such strategy ( Fig. 4 ). Exercise snacks involving thrice daily ~15–30 s of hard effort involving cycling and more practical stair climbing are efficacious for improving CRF and exercise performance in inactive adults. Exercise snacks may also have potential to improve aspects of cardiometabolic health in individuals with obesity, but their efficacy in clinical populations remains to be established as existing reports have studied a small number of participants in laboratory-based settings. Relatedly — and perhaps most importantly — the applicability of exercise snacks in a “real-world” ( e.g. , in home-, office-, or work-based) setting and the potential for exercise snacks to target musculoskeletal health remain to be determined. Figure 4: Exercise snacks — brief isolated bouts of vigorous exercise performed over the course of the day — represent a feasible, well-tolerated, and time-efficient strategy to simultaneously improve cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) and reduce the detrimental impact of prolonged sedentary behavior on cardiometabolic health (created with BioRender.com ).

Copy URL Share a link Share on Email Facebook x LinkedIn Reddit Wechat Abstract Loss of muscle mass and strength are seemingly accepted as part of the ageing process, despite ultimately leading to the loss of independence. Resistance exercise is considered to be primary defence against loss of muscle function in older age, but it typically requires access to exercise equipment often in a gym environment. This pilot study aimed at examining the effect of a 28-day, unsupervised home-based exercise intervention on indices of leg strength and muscle size in healthy older adults. Twenty participants were randomly assigned to either maintain their habitual physical activity levels (Control; n = 10; age, 74 (5) years; body mass, 26.3 (3.5)\u2009kg/m 2 ) or undertake “exercise snacks” twice daily (ES; n = 10; age, 70 (4) years; body mass, 25.0 (3.4)\u2009kg/m 2 ). Both groups consumed 150\u2009g of yogurt at their breakfast meal for the duration of the intervention. Sixty-second sit-to-stand score improved by 31% in ES, with no change in Control ( p < 0.01). Large effect sizes were observed for the difference in change scores between the groups for interpolated maximum leg pressing power (6% increase in ES) and thigh muscle cross-sectional area (2% increase in ES). The present pilot data suggest that exercise snacking might be a promising strategy to improve leg muscle function and size in older adults and that further investigation into zero-cost exercise strategies that allow high frequency of training is warranted. 1. Introduction Frailty is underpinned by a progressive loss of muscle mass and strength, particularly from the lower limbs, and is associated with increased risk of falls and reduced quality of life [ 1 , 2 ]. There is a minimum threshold of strength required to complete tasks of daily living independently, and finding means to delay individuals reaching this “frailty threshold” has been identified as an urgent health care priority [ 3 ]. With muscle mass lost at 0.5–1% per year after 50 years of age [ 4 ] and strength lost even more rapidly [ 5 ], modest improvements of a few percent in muscle size and strength from a training programme may, in essence, represent postponement of frailty measurable in years. Crucially, intervention is needed before older adults’ functional capacity declines past the point that exercise is no longer a safe means to maintain muscle strength. Progressive resistance exercise training improves muscle strength in older adults, and it is accompanied by multifaceted improvements in health and function [ 6 , 7 ]. Traditionally, heavy load resistance training has been regarded as the most effective strategy to increase muscle strength, due to associated neural and hypertrophic adaptations [ 8 , 9 ]. Recent evidence suggests that low-load resistance training can also be efficacious in increasing muscle strength, particularly in an untrained population, albeit to a lesser degree in comparison to high-load resistance training [ 10 , 11 ]. Training with low loads and low overall session volume may allow for increased training frequency, as recovery times may be shorter between sessions [ 12 ]. Dankel et al. [ 13 ] suggests that manipulation of training frequency to maintain overall training volume with more sessions of lower load across a week may even increase hypertrophic training responses. Although this has not yet been borne out empirically [ 8 ], it is intuitively appealing to reason that a reduced training session load with short recovery times may suit an older population previously doing no formal exercise because it may overcome some of the barriers to starting an exercise programme [ 14 ]. Short bouts of exercise spread across the day, termed “exercise snacks,” have received attention as a time-efficient exercise strategy. Francois et al. [ 15 ] identified that exercise snacking before each meal, consisting of six discrete minutes of exercise separated by one minute of rest, improved glycaemic control the following day in middle-aged adults with impaired glucose handling. Jenkins et al. [ 16 ] reported improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness in healthy inactive adults performing three sets of maximum effort 60-step stair climbs a day, three times a week, for six weeks. The improvement in exercise tolerance included an increase in maximum power output during a VO 2 peak test on a cycle ergometer [ 16 ]. This suggests that an exercise snacking model may have the potential to improve function beyond just cardiovascular fitness. As such, exercise snacking was examined in the present pilot study with the aim of providing a stimulus to improve leg strength in older adults that could be undertaken in the home on a daily basis without the need for supervision. The primary aim of the present pilot study was to investigate the effects of four weeks of twice daily “exercise snacking” on maximum number of sit-to-stands from a chair performed in one minute, compared with a control group maintaining their habitual physical activity patterns. The secondary aims were to assess adherence to the exercise snacking intervention, along with the effects on force, velocity, and power, during leg press dynamometry and on whole-body and lower limb anthropometry. The proposed intervention was specifically designed to be suitable to perform in the home environment, without the need for supervision or specific exercise equipment. The overall objective of this pilot study was to inform future work on exercise strategies extending to populations with lifestyle-compromising age-related loss of muscle strength or mass. 2. Materials and Methods A two-group experimental research design was used in this pilot study to examine the effects of twice daily “exercise snacking” on muscle function and size in healthy, community-dwelling older adults. For 28 days, one group undertook a home-based exercise snacking intervention (ES) and the other group acted as a nonexercising control by maintaining habitual physical activity levels. As a control variable, both groups were provided with 150\u2009g of yogurt to consume as part of their breakfast meal for the 28 days, to both act as a “positive control” to reduce participant dropout from the Control group and to achieve optimal dietary protein intake [ 17 ]. All participants completed two familiarisation sessions to functional measures used in the pre- and postintervention assessment, separated by at least seven days, with the second session completed at least five days before the preintervention assessments. Function testing and imaging measures were completed on the day before and the day after the 28-day intervention. Between familiarisation sessions and during the last week of the intervention, physical activity and diet were assessed. See Figure 1 for a schematic overview of the pilot study timeline. Figure 1 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint A schematic overview of the pilot study timeline. 2.1. Participants Twenty healthy, community-dwelling, older men and women (65–80 years), not undertaking regular structured exercise, were recruited for the pilot study through local newspaper advertisement and social media. Individuals who were nonsmokers, had BMI of \u2009≥20\u2009<\u200930\u2009kg/m 2 , had no contraindications to exercise or recent history of musculoskeletal injury, and had scored 8 or above with no score of zero on any test of the SPPB [ 18 ] at the initial screening were invited to take part in the pilot study. Participants were assigned to groups by way of minimisation to limit differences in mean age, BMI, and 60-second sit-to-stand (STS) score at the screening visit, on account of the small sample size [ 19 , 20 ]. An individual outside of the study team performed participant group allocation. Participant characteristics recorded during screening are presented in Table 1 . All participants provided written informed consent. The protocol was approved by the National Health Service (NHS) South West—Frenchay Research Ethics Committee (Ref: 16/SW/0300) and registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (Identifier: NCT02991989 ).

Measures 3.1. Imaging Participants arrived at the laboratory for trial days following a 10-hour overnight fast, having drunk 1 pint of water, and having not undertaken exhaustive exercise in the previous 24 hours. Participants were asked to void before weight was measured with electronic scales (BC543, Tanita, Amsterdam, Netherlands). Whole-body composition, whole-body lean mass, and leg lean mass were estimated using a DXA system (QDR software version 12.4.2, Hologic Discovery W, Bedford, MA) by differentiating the fat, bone, and lean (nonbone nonfat) masses. A spine phantom was used for the quality control scan performed at the start of every trial day before participant testing, as per the manufacturer’s guidelines. Participants wore the same light clothes for pre- and postintervention trials and removed all metal items. The investigator positioned the participant to be laying supine on the scanning bed such that body regions could be partitioned upon analysis. Manual placement of boundaries between discrete anatomical regions was conducted for all scans by the same investigator (OJP), before analysis using manufacturer’s software. Lower limb (calf and thigh) muscle cross-sectional area (mCSA) was assessed by peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT; XCT3000, StraTec Medizintechnik GmbH, Pforzheim, Germany). During the preintervention trial, tibia (medial knee joint line to medial malleolus) and femur length (greater trochanter to lateral knee joint line) of the dominant leg were measured using a fabric tape measure whilst participants were standing. Scans were performed with the participant laying supine on a bed with leg placed through the scanning gantry and foot strapped into a footplate. Scout scans were performed at the distal ends of the tibia and femur to locate the end of bones, respectively. Single 2D slice scans were performed at 66% of the tibia length proximally from the medial malleolus, and 25% of the femur length proximally to the lateral femoral epicondyle, based on the bone lengths previously recorded. Scan images were analysed using the BoneJ plugin (Version 1.4.2) for ImageJ (1.44p, Wayne Rasband, National Institutes of Health, USA) [ 21 , 22 ]. Following scanning measures, participants were provided with a breakfast of their choice, which was matched on the postintervention trial day. 3.2. Functional Measures A maximum number of repeated STS in 60 seconds were performed from a chair with a seat height of 44\u2009cm, with arms folded across the chest and reaching full hip and knee extension on standing. During familiarisation, a researcher counted the number of repetitions aloud, with a timing clock in view of the participant. On trial days, participants were not in view of a clock and repetitions were not counted aloud, with participants instructed to complete repetitions at the fastest rate they could manage until told to stop. Immediately on completion of the STS, a rating of perceived exertion (RPE) was assessed using Borg’s RPE 15-grade scale [ 23 ]. Maximum leg pressing velocity, force, and power characteristics were measured on a seated pneumatic leg press dynamometer (A420, Keiser®, Fresno, CA). Data collection, processing, and analysis were performed as described previously [ 24 ]. Briefly, during familiarisation sessions, participants completed tests of one-repetition maximum (1-RM) leg pressing force against self-selected increments in resistance. No emphasis was placed on contraction velocity for the 1-RM test, and participants were instructed to reach 1-RM within 15 repetitions with self-selected interrepetition rest. Participants then performed a series of approximately 10 discrete repetitions, each performed at maximum concentric contraction velocity against an incrementally increasing pedal resistance, up to a resistance equalling the previously achieved 1-RM. On trial days, a set warm-up was performed based on the 1-RM achieved in the second familiarisation, consisting of 5\u2009×\u200930%-1RM, 5\u2009×\u200950%-1RM, 2\u2009×\u200970%-1RM, and 1\u2009×\u200980%-1RM, followed by five minutes of seated rest. The aforementioned incremental test was then performed, with the tenth repetition at a resistance equal to the 1-RM achieved in the second familiarisation. To extrapolate theoretical maximum contraction velocity ( V max ) and force ( F max ), linear regression of force and velocity at which peak power of each repetition occurred was calculated. Interpolated peak power ( P max ) was determined by numerical differentiation of the second-order polynomial calculated from the force-power profile, i.e., from peak power and the force at the instant of peak power for each repetition [ 25 ]. 3.3. Physical Activity Free-living physical activity was assessed on seven consecutive days by continuous wear of an armband mounted physical activity monitor (SenseWear, BodyMedia, Inc., Pittsburg, PA, USA). This was undertaken between the familiarisation sessions before the intervention period as a baseline measure and during the last week of the intervention period. Physical activity level (PAL) was calculated as estimated mean daily energy expenditure/resting metabolic rate (estimated using the World Health Organisation equation). Only days with >95% wear time achieved were included in the analysis. Participants were instructed to remove the armband for water-based activity, such as bathing or showering, and any water-based activities were recorded in the logbook. 3.4. Diet Records Three-day weighed diet records (two weekdays and one weekend) were completed by participants. Again, this was undertaken between familiarisation sessions and during the last week of the intervention period. Commercially available online software (v4.312 Nutritics Education, Dublin, Ireland) was used for diet record analysis, all of which was performed by the same researcher (OJP). Mean daily intake of total kcal, carbohydrate (CHO), protein (PRO), and fat were obtained and calculated relative to body mass using screening body mass and postintervention body mass for baseline and intervention dietary records, respectively. Between pre- and postintervention trials, participants consumed 150\u2009g of yogurt (Natural flavour, Skyr, Arla®; 98\u2009kcal, 0.3\u2009g fat, 6\u2009g carbohydrate, 16.5\u2009g protein) as part of their breakfast meal. Participants were provided with food weighing scales and a logbook to record whether the full 150\u2009g of yogurt had been consumed each day and deliberately not given any further instruction concerning dietary intake. 3.5. Intervention The Control group was asked to continue with their habitual physical activities for 28 days. The exercise snacking group was asked to perform two bouts of “exercise snacking” per day, once in the morning and once in the evening. Exercise snacking bouts consisted of five exercises, each undertaken for one minute with the aim to complete as many repetitions as possible in that minute. Between each exercise, participants rested for one minute. The exercises were STS from a chair, seated knee extensions of alternating legs, standing knee bends of alternating legs, marching on the spot, and standing calf raises (see Supplemental Figures S1–S5, respectively). Participants were advised to hold onto a chair for stability during standing exercise if they felt the need to. The STS exercise was performed first, with the number of repetitions completed recorded in a provided logbook as a means to assess adherence. Any adverse events during the intervention period for either group were to be recorded in a logbook, regardless of whether they were related to the intervention. 3.6. Statistical Analysis Shapiro–Wilks tests of normality were performed on participant characteristic data recorded at screening (age, body mass, BMI, and STS score) due to the small sample size. Participant characteristic variables were normally distributed, thus compared with independent-samples t -test. Outcome variables were analysed with a two-way repeated measures ANOVA, and where there was a significant interaction or time effect was observed, a Holm–Bonferroni post hoc test performed. Statistical significance was accepted at p < 0.05. To infer the magnitude of differences between the groups, Hedges g effect size for difference in change scores between the groups was calculated, to account for low sample size [ 26 ]. Effect sizes were classed as small (0.2), moderate (0.5), and large (0.8) according to Cohen [ 27 ]. Data are presented as mean (standard deviation); ANOVA and post hoc analysis were performed using SPSS v22.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL), and effect size analysis was performed using Microsoft® Excel® 2016. 4. Results 4.1. Functional Measures Adherence to the ES intervention was 98% (2 (1) sessions out of 56 sessions missed), and no adverse events occurred during the intervention period in either group. Pre- to postintervention STS scores were significantly increased ( p < 0.01) in the ES group (29 (8) to 38 (13)), compared with the Control group (29 (14) to 29 (13)). There was a large between-group effect size of g =\u20091.40 for the difference in STS change scores (Figure 2 ). There was no significant change in RPE for the STS pre- and postintervention in either group (Control: 13 (3) to 14 (2); ES: 13 (2) to 14 (2)). There were no significant time or interaction effects for V max , F max , or P max (Table 2 ). Effect sizes for change scores between the groups were moderate for V max and F max ( g =\u20090.62 and g =\u20090.49, respectively) and large for P max ( g =\u20090.81).

Anthropometry One participant from the Control group was removed from DXA analysis due to movement artefact on one scan. As shown in Table 3 , there were no significant changes in body mass, or DXA measured % body fat, total lean mass, or lean leg mass in either group, but a moderate effect size for the difference in leg lean mass change scores ( g =\u20090.68).

Group size was n = 10 unless stated otherwise. One participant from the ES group was removed from the calf pQCT scan analysis, and one participant from the Control group was removed from the thigh pQCT scan analysis, both due to movement artefact. Calf mCSA did not change significantly for either group, with an effect size for difference in the change scores between the groups being g =\u20090.10. There were no statistically significant changes in thigh mCSA in either group, although there was a large effect size for the difference in change scores between the groups ( g =\u20090.96) with an increase of 2% in the ES group (see Figure 3 ). Figure 3 (a) Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Individual changes in pQCT measured (a) calf muscle at 66% tibia and (b) thigh muscle group at 25% femur, pre- and postintervention of either 28 days of yogurt at breakfast only (Control) or yogurt at breakfast and exercise snacking twice daily (ES).

Physical Activity and Diet There were no changes in PAL in either group from baseline assessment to the last week of the intervention, nor were there changes in total energy (kcal/kg/day) or carbohydrate intake (g/kg/day). There were significant time effects for an increase in daily protein intake ( p < 0.01) and decrease in daily fat intake ( p < 0.05). Because there were no differences between the groups, the effect size for the pooled change score (pre- to postintervention for all participants) were moderate for dietary protein and fat intake ( g =\u20090.71 and g =\u20090.60, respectively) (see Table 4 ).

Discussion and Implications The impact of undertaking 28 days of twice daily home-based exercise snacking, supplemented with 150\u2009g of yogurt at breakfast, on lower limb muscle function and anthropometry was explored in healthy older adults. Adherence to the exercise regime was very high (98%), and participants in the ES group showed marked improvements in the number of sit-to-stands performed in 60 seconds, with no improvement in the Control group. Large effect sizes were also observed in the change scores for interpolated maximum leg pressing power and thigh muscle cross-sectional area, albeit the absolute increases in these variable appear modest. The exercise snacking regime consisted of five leg exercises; each completed twice a day across two bouts, with the aim to complete as many repetitions of each exercise as possible in a minute with no external load above body weight. This mode of exercise deviates from successful home-based exercise programmes explored previously; primarily, in that, all exercise was nonloaded, participants undertook exercise twice a day, there were no supervised exercise sessions in the home, and the programme lasted only four weeks [ 28 ]. The ES group showed significantly improved STS score, with the 31% improvement in the STS in 60 seconds in the present pilot study being remarkably similar to the 30% improvement in 30-second STS score observed after six weeks of resistance training in older adults by Cavani et al. [ 29 ]. With 60-second STS being one of the exercises completed twice daily for the ES group, this was not unexpected, even though the conditions between exercise bouts and testing sessions were deliberately different (self-timed vs. no information of time remaining in the test). Although the improvement in STS is likely largely due to task-specific training, the movement pattern is nonetheless relevant for tasks of daily living [ 30 ]. Given that the mode of training applied no external load beyond body weight and did not require participants to exercise to momentary failure, improvements in leg press V max and F max of 3% and 5%, respectively, along with a trend toward significant increases in P max (6% increase; p = 0.09) were perhaps not expected and provide an indication of the potential efficacy of this type of “little and often” intervention. As a point of comparison, in the study by Bean et al. [ 31 ], older adults trained three times a week for 12 weeks, completing three sets of 10 repetitions of maximum concentric contraction speed exercises similar to those of the present pilot study, whilst wearing a weighted vest. The weighted vest group increased maximum leg press power by 12%, also assessed with pneumatic leg press dynamometry. Although the present pilot study employed an intervention only one-third of the programme duration as the aforementioned study, and without external loading, a 6% increase in P max was observed. Whether functional improvements of the exercise snacking regime over longer training durations would continue to increase with the only element of progression being completion of more repetitions in a minute cannot be known. It should be noted that although the participants in the present pilot study were previously undertaking no regular structured exercise, they were healthy and not functionally impaired, so were perhaps more physiologically receptive to the training stimulus provided than a frail or clinical population might be [ 32 ]. Nonetheless, increases in F max and P max of 5% and 6%, respectively, represent changes with real-world relevance given the estimated annual loss of muscle strength of 1–5% described by Seene and Kaasik [ 33 ], particularly as the strength and power gains were achieved in four weeks with a zero-cost exercise intervention. However, whether these task-specific increases in strength and power lead to clinically relevant improvements in outcomes, such as delaying dynapenia/sarcopenia or frailty, would require further investigation and long-term follow-up. There were some small but noteworthy changes in anthropometric measures of the legs following the ES intervention. In particular, leg lean mass measured by DXA increased by 1% ( g =\u20090.68) and thigh mCSA increased by 2% with a large effect size ( g =\u20090.98). In comparison to an effect size of 0.39 (0.17) (95% CI: 0.05, 0.73) for hypertrophy induced by low-load resistance exercise training calculated in a recent meta-analysis by Schoenfeld et al. [ 11 ], the potential increase in muscle size observed in present pilot is notable. No mechanisms for an increase in muscle size were examined in this work, but it could be in part due to the comparatively high frequency of training, although this of course can only be speculated due to the scarcity of studies using twice daily exercise programmes [ 8 , 13 ]. It is also possible that any hypertrophy observed in the present pilot study was in part due to the additional protein ingested at breakfast via the yogurt supplement. This notion would be supported by the evidence of Mamerow et al. [ 34 ], albeit in a younger population, that 24-hour muscle protein synthesis rate was greater with an even distribution of protein throughout the day compared with a more traditional, evening heavy, protein distribution. Although it is encouraging that two independent measurement techniques concomitantly suggest that a short-term exercise snacking intervention may have potential to increase leg muscle size, the absolute changes were small, and exercise-induced oedema from the previous day’s exercise cannot be ruled out as a potential confounder in this instance [ 35 ]. However, this seems unlikely given the nature of the exercise snacking bouts, the fact that participants would have been accustomed to the exercise after 28 days, and that the increase in mCSA was not observed in the calf muscle group that was also measured by pQCT [ 36 ]. Both groups modestly increased daily protein intake per kilogram of body mass by 17% and 19% during the intervention (Control and ES, respectively), going from 1.05 (0.20)\u2009g/kg/day to 1.24 (0.32)\u2009g/kg/day (pooled mean). Although the older adults in the present pilot study were previously consuming over-the-recommended daily allowance (RDA) of protein, Phillips et al. [ 17 ] present convincing rationale that the RDA may not represent an optimal daily protein intake for older adults in particular. The suggested range of 1.2 to 1.6\u2009g/kg/day as a more appropriate daily protein intake was achieved in the present pilot study with the addition of 16.5\u2009g of dairy protein at breakfast. However, further inspection of the absolute change in dietary protein consumption highlighted that total protein intake increased by ≈10\u2009g/day. There was not an increase in daily protein intake equal to the amount contained in the yogurt possibly because protein that would have been included in the breakfast meal may have been replaced with the yogurt. This is potentially important on a per meal basis, as larger protein doses are required to maximally stimulate muscle protein synthesis in older adults. Moreover, this potentially serves to highlight the challenges with supplementing older adult diets with additional protein. In any case, whether an extra 10\u2009g/d protein intake would lead to clinically relevant outcomes in an older population is questionable. The lack of increase in strength or hypertrophy in the Control group support the work of Kim et al. [ 37 ], finding that even adjusting protein distribution for 8 weeks without the addition of exercise does not increase muscle mass or strength in older adults. Importantly, this was despite achieving over 1.2\u2009g/kg/day of protein, highlighting the importance of a combination of exercise and nutrition to address muscle loss with ageing However, the duration of the intervention in the present pilot study was very short, and the use of only three-day diet records are often criticised for a bias toward under reporting [ 38 ]. Consequently, these data should not be seen to undermine the potential health and body composition benefits of a longer-term increase in dietary protein intake for older adults not meeting recommended quantities of dietary protein intake [ 39 ]. There are a number of crucial considerations when contextualising the present findings. Most obviously, the pilot study design employed cannot support the efficacy of exercise snacking without dietary protein supplementation. The addition of two further groups (a true nonexercising control group and an exercise snacking without yogurt group) would shed light on the importance of the additional protein at breakfast, but it would require a large increase in sample size. Moreover, based on the effect size of the present pilot study data, power calculations (G∗power, Version 3.1.9.4) indicated that for statistically significant differences in P max ( α = 0.05 and power\u2009=\u20090.8), 27 participants per group would have been required using the current research design. Equally, group sizes of 19 would have been required for statistically significant differences in thigh mCSA. By increasing sample size, a traditional randomisation strategy to allocate participants to study groups could have been appropriate, whereas due to a small sample size, minimisation was implemented as means to reduce chance difference in baseline characteristics of groups in this present pilot study [ 20 ]. Although the adherence to the exercise programme was very high, it cannot be assumed that this would persist longer than four weeks or in other older populations [ 40 ]. Investigation of physiological mechanisms to support the strength and hypertrophic gains observed in the present findings may also allow for further optimisation of the exercise regime itself, creating a potentially more efficacious training stimulus. In the same vein, a longer-term follow-up would also be required to establish whether the physiological adaptions might continue to occur if the exercise stimulus were to be maintained. It should of course not be overlooked that high-load resistance training has superior effects on increasing muscle mass and strength [ 11 , 41 ], potentially through more pronounced neural adaptations [ 42 ], and more easily accommodates progressive overload to facilitate continuous improvements in muscle mass and strength. However, accepting that access and cost of exercise participation and lack of knowledge of exercise modalities are often key barriers to exercise in older adults [ 43 ], very simple home-based exercise snacking-style regimes are a promising strategy to engage older adults in exercise. 6. Conclusions In conclusion, although underpowered to show statistically significant changes, the present study highlights the potential efficacy of a 28-day, home-based “little and often” exercise snacking programme, for improving leg power and muscle size in healthy older adults. Along with marked task-specific improvements in sit-to-stand score, indications that maximum leg press force and power may also improve modestly with exercise snacking demonstrate transferability of the training. Whether these changes represent potentially clinically relevant improvements in function requires further investigation. Although more research is certainly needed to explain the mechanisms by which such a short-term exercise snacking regime may improve muscle strength and size, understanding the real-world acceptability of this exercise strategy could help provide easy-to-act-upon recommendations for older adults to maintain function into later life.

However, certain post-exercise behaviors, including the consumption of unhealthy high-calorie foods, can counteract some of the benefits of physical activity. There are at least three overlapping pathways through which exercise may increase the likelihood of consuming pleasurable but unhealthy foods: through impulsive cognitive processes, reflective cognitive processes, and/or physiological responses. It is argued in this paper that motivation toward exercise can influence each of these pathways. Drawing from literature from various domains, we postulate that controlled exercise motivation, as opposed to autonomous exercise motivation, is more likely to influence each of these pathways in a manner that leaves individuals susceptible to the post-exercise consumption of pleasurable but unhealthy foods. Keywords: unhealthy snacking ; motivation ; exercise ; ego depletion ; compensation ; physiology 1. Introduction Energy intake following exercise is extremely variable across individuals and situations (see e.g., [ 1 , 2 ]). Conjecture remains as to the causes of this variability, but evidence is accumulating to indicate that psychological factors associated with both food consumption and exercise are influential in this regard (e.g., [ 3 , 4 ]). In this article, we argue that exercise motivation is likely to influence post-exercise snack consumption (we use a variety of phrases throughout this article in relation to post-exercise food consumption (e.g., “snack consumption”, “snacking”). In all instances though, our focus is on the consumption of hedonically pleasurable but unhealthy foods. We do not wish to offer examples of these foods because there is likely to be both intra- and inter-individual variability in the experience of pleasure during the consumption of specific foods.), and we draw on conceptual and empirical work on self-determination theory [ 5 ] to support our argument. First, we overview the nature of exercise motivation from the perspective of self-determination theory, and we also highlight known outcomes of regulations discussed within this theory. Included within this discussion is commentary on two recent studies that support our premise that controlled, as opposed to autonomous, exercise motivation is linked to post-exercise snacking. Our attention then turns to the “why” question—Why is it that this relationship should exist? In addressing this issue, we argue that controlled exercise motivation affects cognitive (both impulsive and reflective) and physiological pathways that frequently precede the consumption of hedonically pleasurable foods. Figure 1 displays the nature of the relationships that are postulated in this article. We hope that our discussion stimulates research on post-exercise snacking, but we also hope to make a broader point that our understanding of health behavior is limited when we consider a given behavior in isolation. More specifically, we feel that a richer understanding of the health consequences of any behavior is obtained when considering how that behavior influences, and is influenced by, the multitude of other behaviors upon which our health is dependent. For now though, our focus is on the effect of exercise motivation on post-exercise snacking, and our discussion begins with a brief overview of motivation as it is described in self-determination theory. Figure 1. Hypothesized relationships between exercise, exercise motivation, and post-exercise consumption of pleasurable but unhealthy foods. Figure 1. Hypothesized relationships between exercise, exercise motivation, and post-exercise consumption of pleasurable but unhealthy foods. Exercise Motivation from the Lens of Self-Determination Theory Physical exercise is a salubrious behavior that is often associated with a variety of positive experiences and outcomes (see [ 6 ]). The extent to which these experiences and outcomes are fully understood and accepted, however, varies between people. Some individuals undertake exercise because they fully endorse the instrumental outcomes of the activity ( i.e. , “identified regulation”), because it is aligned with their values and identity ( i.e. , “integrated regulation”), and/or because they enjoy the process of exercising ( i.e. , “intrinsic motivation”). According to proponents of self-determination theory [ 5 ], individuals who predominantly cite these reasons for their exercise are said to be autonomously motivated . Their motivation comes from a sense of endorsement and is experienced as volitional. Others exercise to obtain externally imposed rewards or avoid externally imposed punishments ( i.e. , “external regulation”), and/or because they pressure themselves to participate in the activity ( i.e. , “introjected regulation”). Individuals who mainly cite these reasons to exercise exhibit controlled motivation , because their exercise activity is governed by internally or externally imposed pressures. Self-determination theorists sometimes discuss motivation at a level of discrete regulations (e.g., intrinsic motivation), whereas at other times, scholars take a broader perspective, examining the overall extent to which individuals feel self-endorsement and ownership vs. pressure over their behavior. We utilize both approaches in this article. That is, our argument occasionally centers on exemplar forms of autonomous or controlled motivation, and on other occasions centers on individuals’ general sense of self-agency in relation to exercise. Figure 2 displays motivations discussed within self-determination as well as their position in an autonomy continuum. Figure 2. Motivations discussed in self-determination theory and their position in an autonomy continuum. Figure 2. Motivations discussed in self-determination theory and their position in an autonomy continuum. In relation to self-determined motivation in the context of exercise, research has shown that those who cite more autonomous (versus controlled) reasons to exercise, among other things, report fewer cases of exercise relapse [ 7 ], report greater exercise intentions [ 7 ], exercise more frequently (for review, see [ 8 ]), and derive a higher sense of well-being from their exercise (e.g., [ 9 ]). Aside from this research, recent work has also focused on the influence of these exercise motivations on post-exercise food consumption. For instance, Werle, Wansink, and Payne [ 4 ] found that participants were more prone to seek snacks when reading about “tiring” physical activity as opposed to “fun” physical activity. The concept of “fun” is directly associated with intrinsic motivation, which is the most autonomous form of motivation [ 5 ], and although “tiring” is not inherently associated with controlled motivation, past research indicates that it is more likely to be aligned with this type of motivation than with autonomous motivation (see e.g., [ 10 , 11 ]). Other work by Fenzl, Bartsch, and Koenigstorfer [ 12 ] has provided even stronger support for the notion that exercise motivation moderates post-exercise snacking. In their study, Fenzl et al. [ 12 ] invited participants with varying types of exercise motivation to complete a 20 min cycle session labeled as either “fat-burning” or “endurance” training, and then offered participants unhealthy snacks (a large bowl of pretzels). The researchers found an interaction effect between exercise framing and contextual motivation, but in general, autonomously motivated exercisers consumed less of the unhealthy snack food than those exhibiting controlled motivation. The significant interaction effect in this study is certainly worthy of more focus in future work, but the main effect involving motivation is most interesting from our standpoint. The authors built their hypothesis for the role of exercise motivation on post-exercise snacking on the basis of reflective justifications. That is, they speculated that individuals who “self-imposed” physical activity (which was operationalized as controlled motivation) would be more likely to license themselves to food reward, at least under some conditions. They did not assess this mechanism though, and we suggest that this conscious licensing represents only one of at least three pathways that can explain the link between controlled exercise motivation and post-exercise snacking. 2. Mechanisms for the Influence of Exercise Motivation on Post-Exercise Snacking Before we begin our discussion of how exercise motivation might influence conscious licensing ( i.e. , the mechanism outlined by Fenzl and colleagues [ 12 ]), it is important to highlight the difference between this form of cognitive operation and another form that is also key to understanding post-exercise snacking. An assumption in most dominant theories of health behavior (e.g., [ 13 , 14 ]) is that behavior is governed by conscious and deliberate cognitive processing ( i.e. , conscious reflection, such as licensing). However, an abundance of recent evidence indicates that conscious thought is not always a good predictor of behavior (e.g., [ 15 ]), and in light of this issue, dual-process accounts of health behavior have become increasingly popular. These dual-process models describe two broad forms of cognitive processes—Those that are relatively conscious, effortful, slow, and operate efficiently under moderate levels of physiological arousal (herein termed “reflective”), and those that are effortless, fast, and are especially influential under high- or low-levels of physiological arousal (herein termed “impulsive”). Conceivably, these cognitive processes can operate in three different ways to predict behavior: (a) in an additive manner, in which the two types of processes explain a different portion of the variance in the same given behavior; (b) a double dissociation operation, in which the impulsive process predicts spontaneous behavior whereas the reflective process predicts deliberative behavior; and (c) in a multiplicative fashion, in which the impulsive and reflective processes interact to influence behavior [ 16 ]. Evidence has emerged to indicate that the double dissociation model is particularly relevant for understanding snacking behavior [ 16 , 17 , 18 ]. More specifically, research on these dual processes has indicated that reflective processes are often a better predictor of deliberative snacking, whereas impulsive processes are a stronger predictor of spontaneous snacking. The former process will be discussed first; our discussion of the latter process will follow in a subsequent (second) section. In a third section, we discuss the implications of exercise motivation on physiological pathways that are influential in snacking responses. 2.1. Exercise Motivation and Reflective Justifications for Snacking Many individuals have difficulty maintaining an equilibrium between fulfilling immediate desires (e.g., consuming pleasurable snacks) and satisfying long-term goals (e.g., for health) [ 19 , 20 ]. Recently, it has been proposed that one cognitive strategy people employ to reach this equilibrium is to activate compensatory beliefs [ 21 ]. These compensatory beliefs reflect the idea that the negative effects of one behavior can be neutralized or compensated for by the positive effects of another. According to the compensatory beliefs model [ 21 ], when goals associated with pleasure and harm come into conflict (e.g., “this cake will be tasty but it is unhealthy”), a negative intrapersonal state of cognitive dissonance is created. Cognitive dissonance reflects an aversive motivational state that occurs when an individual holds two cognitions that are inconsistent with each other [ 22 ]. This unpleasant state can be resolved, among other ways, by altering one of the two dissonant cognitions, and it is through this pathway that compensatory beliefs are likely to operate. That is, the creation or activation of compensatory beliefs resolves cognitive dissonance because the negative health-related cognitions involved in the dissonance are likely to be reduced or be eliminated altogether ( i.e. , consumption of the cake is no longer seen as detrimental to health because of the perceived neutralizing impact of exercise). Conceptual work indicates that compensatory health beliefs are more likely to be active when individuals experience controlled motivation for a task [ 23 ]. As previously mentioned, compensatory beliefs become active when people face a conflict between goals to maximize pleasure and to minimize harm. In the case of controlled exercisers, the experience of physical activity satisfies the goal to minimize harm—Most individuals are likely to recognize at least some health benefits of physical exercise. However, these individuals are less likely to simultaneously satisfy their desire to experience pleasure while undertaking physical activity, so the potential for conflict between maximizing pleasure and avoiding harm is salient for these people. Goal conflict is less problematic for those who are autonomously motivated for exercise, because their experience of autonomous functioning is likely to satisfy both positive instrumental and affective goals (e.g., [ 24 ]). As such, individuals who are controlled in their exercise regulation are more likely to activate compensatory beliefs to satisfy their multiple goals, and preliminary empirical work by Miquelon, Knäuper, and Vallerand [ 25 ] has supported this premise. These authors found that autonomous motivation toward weight loss lessened participants’ activation of dietary compensatory beliefs, and that compensatory beliefs weakened consistency in adherence to dieting rules. Fishbach and colleagues [ 26 , 27 ] provide more support for the notion that controlled motivation for exercise should increase post-exercise licensing for snack food consumption. Over a series of studies, Fishbach and Dhar [ 26 ] found that self-regulation through goal balancing ( i.e. , the management of multiple and often contradictory goals) hinges on a focus on goal progress. That is, when individuals perceive that goal progress has been made on one goal (e.g., toward good health), they are likely to switch to the pursuit of alternative, often contradictory, goals (e.g., consumption of unhealthy but pleasurable food) in order to balance their multiple activated goals. This effect of goal switching has been found to be attenuated, however, when individuals focus on goal commitment rather than goal progress [ 26 ]. When goal commitment is focused upon, an action (e.g., exercise) is framed as a defining feature of one’s self-concept, and the pursuit of contradictory goals (e.g., post-exercise snacking) subsequently becomes more unappealing. This theorizing and research relates to our discussion on motivation insofar as regulations discussed in self-determination theory are defined according to their relevance to the self [ 28 ]. Autonomous motivation, by definition, is characterized by a sense of agency, volition, and identity, whereas controlled motivation is reflected in a sense of inauthenticity and pressure. In sum, autonomously motivated exercisers, as opposed to those possessing controlled motivation, are more likely to embrace a goal commitment focus during/post exercise, and this focus should dampen their desire to pursue the contradictory goal of unhealthy snack consumption. As a final note on reflective processes, it is worth highlighting that the consumption of pleasurable high fat and/or sugary food is likely to be a common choice for consciously-mediated compensation responses post-exercise. These foods have strong effects on reward circuits in the brain involving neurotransmitters, such as dopamine, that are implicated in the experience of pleasure [ 29 , 30 ]. Moreover, compared to other pleasurable activities, snack food consumption is often cheap, quick, and relatively socially acceptable (as opposed to activities such as alcohol or illicit drug use). Compensatory beliefs involving exercise and diet are also likely to be activated as a function of the common perception that energy intake from foods can be expended or “neutralized” via exercise. For all these reasons, snacking and exercise are likely to be common pairings in people’s compensatory belief system. This hypothesis has been indirectly supported in recent work in which 75% of undergraduate participants reported compensatory eating post-exercise [ 31 ], although it must be noted that this statistic reflects compensatory eating rather than compensatory beliefs/justifications, Clearly though, food-related compensatory responses are common after exercise, and there is emerging theoretical and empirical evidence to suggest that these snacking-related justifications are particularly common among exercisers experiencing controlled motivation. 2.2. Exercise Motivation and Impulsive Post-Exercise Snack Consumption Compensatory health beliefs develop via reflective cognitive processes, which operate (relatively) slowly by integrating knowledge about the value and probability of consequences to reach a consciously mediated decision [ 32 ]. As a result of repeated pairings between exercise and snacking behavior, however, compensatory responses may also be elicited by impulsive cognitive processes, which operate by retrieving particular associations that are activated automatically when one encounters a relevant stimulus [ 33 ]. This activation process does not require much cognitive capacity or an intention to evaluate or activate an object or idea. Instead, operations in this system occur quickly, and they are generated as a function of: (a) the preexisting structure of associations in memory; and (b) the particular set of external input stimuli. These operations can produce fast affective and nonaffective outcomes, and they can guide behavior via the activation of behavioral schemata [ 32 ]. To illustrate the mechanisms of the impulsive system, consider a situation in which an individual, after each exercise session, consciously licenses him/herself to consume a sugary drink from a vending machine. Over time, as a result of repeated pairings between exercise and sugary drink consumption, the two behaviors can become structurally associated in memory. If the individual continues to engage in the same type of exercise and in the same location, then the mere act of exercising can elicit a tendency to purchase and consume a sugary drink with little (or even without any) conscious decision process. That is, even though the drink consumption may have originally been regulated by the reflective system, over time it can become governed primarily by the impulsive system. Even in the absence of structural associations in memory between exercise and snacking, controlled-motivated exercisers are more likely to engage in post-exercise snacking by virtue of their increased susceptibility to acting on impulse. One of the most ubiquitous contemporary models of impulsivity is that of the strength model of self-control (e.g., [ 19 , 34 ]), and a brief description of this model is necessary to elucidate how exercise motivation can influence impulsive snack behavior. According to proponents of the strength model, self-control is defined as the ability to override natural impulses and automatic or habitual responses [ 34 ], and it is seen as a limited intra-individual resource that can become depleted with use. In other words, individuals’ ongoing ability to exert self-control is thought to hinge on their prior usage of self-control, and when self-control strength is exhausted, a state of “ego depletion” is experienced. A large body of empirical work on this state provides general support for the strength model. That is, generally speaking, when individuals undertake a task in which self-control is needed, they often perform significantly worse in a subsequent task requiring self-control ( i.e. , they are more likely to act on their impulses; for a review, see [ 35 ]). These failures in self-control seem to be especially likely when the self-control strategies in the second task are different to those needed for the first task [ 36 , 37 ], as would be the case in exercise regulation (which require approach-based strategies) and post-exercise snacking (which require avoidance-based strategies). By definition, behaviors driven by controlled motivation require self-control. These activities are not experienced as enjoyable, fully endorsed, or valued; instead, they are associated with pressures that will encourage withdrawal from parts of the activity or from the activity altogether (see e.g., [ 38 ]). Continued pursuit of these activities will require self-control insofar as participants will need to override their desire to withdraw from the unappealing activity. Moreover, according to principles of the strength model, when individuals exert self-control in exercise, they are likely to suffer from failures of self-control in the aftermath of the exercise. This means that, irrespective of the activation of conscious compensatory beliefs, controlled exercise motivation should increase impulsive snacking post-exercise. Preliminary work by Magaraggia, Dimmock, and Jackson [ 39 ] has provided support for this hypothesis. More specifically, these authors found that students snacked on more glucose-rich food ( i.e. , jelly beans) during a learning task that had been framed in controlling conditions rather than more autonomous conditions. Although the focus in the study by Magaraggia et al. [ 39 ] was on learning motivation rather than exercise motivation, there is little reason to suspect that the mechanisms associated with this effect vary across contexts. In addition, the type of snacking they observed in their study was likely to be governed by impulsive cognitive processes, since a manipulation check performed by the authors uncovered that the participants had been attentive to the learning material throughout the activity. So far in this section, we have discussed the role of exercise motivation in impulsive snacking, but it is important to acknowledge that automatic attitudes toward food are crucial in accounting for snacking behavior via impulsive cognitive processes. Literature indicates that individuals rely more heavily on their automatic attitudes to guide behavior when ego depleted [ 40 ], so the influence of an ego depleted state on unhealthy snack consumption will be moderated by automatic attitudes toward particular unhealthy snacks. In a measure of implicit attitudes toward food, some individuals might evaluate fruit and/or vegetables more positively than high fat/sugar foods, and an ego depleted state in these individuals should not be disadvantageous from a dietary perspective—Their impulse, which has become more difficult to override, is to consume healthy rather than unhealthy foods. Ultimately, ego depletion increases our reliance on our impulses, whatever those impulses might be. 2.3. Exercise Motivation and Physiological Regulation of Post-Exercise Snack Behavior Our discussion of ego depletion has focused on the effects of this state on an individual’s reliance on implicit cognitive processes in guiding behavior. Another body of literature on ego depletion is oriented toward the physiological consequences of this state. Recent theorizing and research has indicated that acts of self-control might be associated with the utilization of fuel substrates in the body (for a review, see [ 35 ]). Gailliot et al. [ 41 ], for example, found that participants who engaged in self-control tasks possessed lower levels of post-task blood glucose relative to a control group, and that lowered blood glucose was subsequently associated with weakened self-control. This may be of relevance given that circulating blood glucose has been implicated in the regulation of appetite for more than 50 years [ 42 ]. Research also indicates that when ego depleted, individuals consume more glucose-rich foods [ 39 ], and they may also up-regulate self-control strength by consuming them (e.g., [ 43 ]). Consequently, exercise driven by controlled motivation may encourage approach behavior toward glucose-rich foods due to physiological reasons associated with ego depletion. In addition to the potential for ego-depletion to influence the physiological control of appetite via glucose, a relationship between motivation for exercise and the consumption of unhealthy, non-nutritious foods post-exercise may be influenced by other physiological signals of hunger. Although no previous research has investigated a role for hormonal signals in mediating a relationship between exercise motivation and post-exercise snack consumption, there is some evidence to suggest that altering one’s mindset alone can influence the circulating concentrations of appetite-regulating peptides. Crum, Corbin, Brownell, and Salovey [ 44 ] investigated the effect of influencing an individual’s perception of calorie intake on the hunger-stimulating hormone, ghrelin. In this study, participants were given an identical 380-calorie milkshake to consume on two separate occasions in a counterbalanced cross-over design; on one occasion the milkshake was presented as “indulgent” and “decadent” while on the alternate occasion it was promoted as a healthy “sensible” shake. The mindset of indulgence was associated with a steeper decline in ghrelin, compared with consumption of the identical shake when perceived as sensible. This raises the intriguing possibility that the approach to exercise, particularly in relation to motivation, may also influence physiological markers of appetite. Future studies are needed to address this issue. A large body of literature on the physiological consequences of stress is also relevant to the proposition that motivation for exercise may influence the hormonal regulation of appetite. A potential alignment between controlled motivation and stress was highlighted in early work on self-determination theory; some 30 years ago, this category of motivation was associated with personality constructs that are maladaptive in relation to stress, such as type A personality, a sense of pressure in achievement contexts, and a sense of public self-consciousness [ 5 ]. More recently, controlled motivation has been linked to behaviors that are synonymous with stress, such as road rage, angry driving, and hostile gestures [ 45 ]. According to Weinstein and Ryan [ 46 ], four pathways exist to explain how a controlled motivation style can influence stress. First, controlled motivation evokes less processing of emotions, which over time decreases emotional health and increases stress. Second, controlled regulation encourages individuals to approach tasks defensively, anticipating them as threats rather than challenges. Third, controlled regulation encourages less interest-taking in one’s experiences, which in turn increases stress, and finally, individuals who feel controlled are likely to engage in certain behaviors, and set goals, that induce more stress. Although one’s mindset toward stress has an effect on its consequences [ 47 ], the physiological characteristics of stress typically involve activation of the sympathetic nervous system, a parasympathetic withdrawal, and increased activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis [ 48 ]. The normal hormonal pathway of the stress response leads to an increase of circulating cortisol, which promotes appetite in order to replenish fuel supplies utilised during the stress response [ 49 ]. While this is desirable in the short term, the repeated elicitation of the stress response, coupled with the ready availability of highly palatable food, leads to the preferential consumption of these foods [ 50 , 51 ]. Furthermore, the intake of these pleasurable but unhealthy foods tends to be self-reinforcing, because such consumption attenuates hyperactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis [ 52 ]. Of relevance, there is evidence in the literature to suggest that a controlling environment, relative to an autonomy supportive environment, increases cortisol reactivity among students [ 53 ]. There is also some limited evidence to suggest that motivation for exercise may influence circulating levels of cortisol. For instance, Di Bartolo, Lin, Montoya, Neal, and Shaffer [ 54 ] reported a significant negative correlation between salivary cortisol and exercise motivations that are synonymous with autonomous functioning. In other research, lower cortisol responses were observed in dancers who experienced greater satisfaction of basic needs that are important drivers of autonomous motivation [ 55 ]. Based on this promising preliminary evidence, further research is required to determine whether the potential influence of motivation for exercise on cortisol has implications for appetite and food intake, and whether motivation for exercise influences other hormonal regulators of appetite. 3. Conclusions Physical exercise offers a number of health benefits that have been well articulated in previous work (e.g., [ 6 ]). Many of these benefits are unequivocal—There is a rich body of evidence to support them—And although there are some potential costs to exercise, such as the possibility of injury, many people see these costs as trivial when weighed against the array of desirable outcomes. Despite widespread knowledge about its health benefits, appreciation for exercise has arisen from analyses of it as an isolated category of behavior. The problem with this approach is that we can often fail to acknowledge or appreciate the possibility that exercise might influence, or be influenced by, other health behaviors. As such, the overall impact of physical exercise on health may be more complicated than previously articulated. In this article, we have argued that exercise driven by controlled motivation is likely to leave individuals susceptible to post-exercise snacking. We highlighted three possible, overlapping reasons for this effect—Via reflective cognitive processes, impulsive cognitive processes, and physiological processes—And together, these reasons could synergistically exert powerful behavioral effects on snacking. It should be noted that we would always promote exercise as a profoundly beneficial behavior for one’s health. The arguments in this paper are not intended to attack the virtues of exercise in any way. Instead, we wish to raise the profile of compensatory exercise/food beliefs as problematic and complex cognitions. It is noteworthy that there are numerous methods that have been shown to facilitate autonomous motivation, including methods within the realm of physical exercise (e.g., [ 56 ]). We recommend that health practitioners utilize these methods to facilitate their clients’ autonomous motivation for exercise, as well as become aware of their clients’ susceptibility to engage in post-exercise snacking. We hope that our arguments in this paper stimulate research on the topic of snack responses following (and perhaps even in anticipation of) exercise. On a broader level, we hope that our work encourages researchers to consider the complex relationships between health behaviors when investigating the health-related consequences of isolated behaviors.

This scoping review aimed to explore characterisations of exercise snacks and summarise their effects on health in adults and older adults. Clinical trial registers (clinicaltrials.gov and ANZCTR) and electronic databases (PubMed, CINAHL, CENTRAL, PsycINFO) were searched from inception to 1 June 2023, for ongoing and published studies of exercise snacks. Backwards and forwards citation tracking was also conducted to identify additional eligible studies. Studies were included if they investigated exercise snacks—brief intermittent bouts of physical activity spread across the day—in adults or older adults. We included epidemiological, experimental, quasi-experimental and qualitative studies that examined the effect of exercise snacks on any health outcomes or described barriers to and enablers of these approaches. Thirty-two studies were included (7 trial registers, 1 published protocol, 3 epidemiological studies and 20 trials reported across 21 studies). Three main terms were used to describe exercise snacks: exercise snack(ing), snacktivity and vigorous intermittent lifestyle physical activity (VILPA). Participants were predominantly physically inactive but otherwise healthy adults or older adults. Exercise snacks were feasible and appeared safe. Epidemiological studies showed steep, near-linear associations of VILPA with reduced all-cause, cardiovascular and cancer mortality as well as reduced incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events and cancer. The limited trial evidence showed exercise snacks had modest effects on improving cardiorespiratory fitness, whereas effects on physical function, mood, quality of life and other health outcomes were equivocal. In conclusion , exercise snacks appear feasible and safe for adults and older adults and may have promising health benefits, but this is mostly based on findings from a limited number of small quasi-experimental studies, small randomised trials or qualitative studies. More studies are needed in individuals with chronic disease. This emerging physical activity approach may have appeal for individuals who find structured exercise unfeasible.

Methods Nine individuals completed three exercise interventions in randomised order. Measures were recorded across 3\xa0days with exercise performed on the middle day, as either: (1) traditional continuous exercise (CONT), comprising 30\xa0min moderate-intensity (60% of maximal heart rate [HR max ]) incline walking before dinner; (2) exercise snacking (ES), consisting of 6\u2009×\u20091\xa0min intense (90% HR max ) incline walking intervals 30\xa0min before each meal; or (3) composite exercise snacking (CES), encompassing 6\u2009×\u20091\xa0min intervals alternating between walking and resistance-based exercise, 30\xa0min before meals. Meal timing and composition were controlled within participants for exercise interventions. Results ES attenuated mean 3\xa0h postprandial glucose concentration following breakfast (by 1.4\u2009±\u20091.5\xa0mmol/l, p =\u20090.02) but not lunch (0.4\u2009±\u20091.0\xa0mmol/l, p =\u20090.22), and was more effective than CONT following dinner (0.7\u2009±\u20091.5\xa0mmol/l below CONT; p =\u20090.04). ES also reduced 24\xa0h mean glucose concentration by 0.7\u2009±\u20090.6\xa0mmol/l ( p =\u20090.01) and this reduction persisted for the subsequent 24\xa0h (lower by 0.6\u2009±\u20090.4\xa0mmol/l vs CONT, relative to their baselines; p =\u20090.01). CES was just as effective as ES ( p >\u20090.05 for all glycaemic variables) at improving glycaemic control. Conclusions/interpretation Dosing exercise as brief, intense ‘exercise snacks’ before main meals is a time-efficient and effective approach to improve glycaemic control in individuals with insulin resistance.

Prolonged periods of sedentary behavior have been linked to heightened risks of non-communicable diseases such as cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes , while engaging in any form of physical activity can elicit favorable effects on health. Nevertheless, epidemiological research indicates that people often struggle to meet recommended physical activity guidelines, citing time constraints, lack of exercise equipment, and environmental limitations as common barriers. Exercise snacks represents a time-efficient approach with the potential to improve physical activity levels in sedentary populations, cultivate exercise routines, and enhance the perception of the health benefits associated with physical activity. We review the existing literature on exercise snacks, and examine the effects of exercise snacks on physical function and exercise capacity, while also delving into the potential underlying mechanisms. The objective is to establish a solid theoretical foundation for the application of exercise snacks as a viable strategy for promoting physical activity and enhancing overall health, particularly in vulnerable populations who are unable to exercise routinely.

Introduction Physical activity provides several physiological and psychological benefits. A lack of exercise can lead to various health issues, including obesity, muscle weakness , and decreased cardiorespiratory fitness, which are contributors of various chronic diseases . Current physical activity guidelines recommend that adults complete a minimum of 75\xa0\u200bminutes (min) of vigorous-intensity or 150\xa0\u200bmin of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise per week, accompanied by at least two sessions of muscle-strengthening exercises. 1 Despite the widely acknowledged positive impacts of regular exercise on physiological adaptations , many individuals struggle to meet these guidelines due to time constraints, limitations imposed by ongoing health conditions and limited access to sports facilities. 2 , 3 The concept of “Exercise Snacks” refers to engaging in multiple brief exercise sessions, each lasting less than or equal to 1\xa0\u200bmin, spaced at intervals of 1–4\xa0\u200bhours (h) throughout the day. This approach allows individuals to seamlessly integrate physical activity into their daily routines without the necessity for dedicated exercise periods or specialized facilities. 4 Exercise snacks can be enjoyed during routine activities or daily tasks, rendering them easy to implement in a variety of settings, including offices, homes, and schools. 5 Importantly, they serve to reverse some of the harms of prolonged periods of sedentary behavior, for example by mitigating the health risks associated with extended periods of sitting ( Fig.\xa01 ). 6 Download: Download high-res image (235KB) Download: Download full-size image Fig.\xa01 . Schematic representation of improved function produced by exercise snacks in sedentary individuals. In recent years, research on exercise snacks has primarily focused on their effects on cardiovascular health, insulin sensitivity , and muscle strength. It also highlights their potential value as a novel exercise strategy in improving the physical fitness of sedentary individuals. This article aims to review the main findings of these studies, emphasizing that exercise snacks are a time-efficient, effective, and safe form of exercise that can enhance the physical fitness of sedentary populations. 2. Overview of exercise snacks The term “Exercise Snacks” was first introduced by Howard Hartley in 2007 7 but did not receive much attention until 2014 when it was investigated by in more detail by Francois et\xa0al. 8 “Exercise Snacks” is an emerging concept in sports science , which aims to re-evaluate the conventional emphasis on accumulating a weekly total of 150\xa0\u200bmin of physical exercise. Instead, exercise snacks concentrate on frequent yet shorter-durations exercise sessions throughout the day, such as 1-min stair climbing or 20-second (s) sprints. Recent research demonstrates that regardless of the duration, every engagement in physical activity can positively impact overall physical health. Furthermore, these studies reveal that when the total time spent on physical activity is held constant, there is no significant disparity in cardiovascular health and other health-related outcomes between prolonged, continuous activity and accumulated, intermittent physical activity. 9 Notably, this concept has garnered support from the recommendations of the World Health Organization on sedentary behavior guidelines. These guidelines have eliminated the previous requirement for adults to engage in continuous physical activity lasting at least 10\xa0\u200bmin per session. 1 The emergence of the “Exercise Snacks” concept offers a practical and viable approach for individuals who find it challenging to allocate longer periods for exercise or those seeking to seamlessly integrate physical activity into their daily routines. Exercise snacks can be broadly organized into two categories: vigorous intermittent exercise and moderate intermittent exercise. 10 Vigorous intermittent exercise involves the brief and intense activities such as stair climbing or sprinting, performed safely and rapidly 3–8 times per day, with each bout lasting less than 1\xa0\u200bmin. This approach is particularly well-suited for adults, especially those grappling with obesity or diabetes. 11 , 12 On the other hand, moderate intermittent exercise is better suited for older adults, entailing intermittent resistance exercises lasting 10\xa0\u200bmin per session and conducted twice daily to enhance skeletal muscle mass and strength. 13 During vigorous intermittent exercise snacks, the exercise intensity is approximately 76%–90% of the maximum heart rate, with an average rating of perceived exertion (RPE) value indicating “hard” or “very hard”. 8 , 11 , 14 However, specific parameters regarding exercise intensity during moderate-intensity intermittent exercise snacks have not been reported. Furthermore, it is important to recognize that these two forms of exercise are not set in stone and can be adjusted flexibly to accommodate individual needs and abilities. 3. Impact of exercise snacks on physical fitness and exercise capacity: possible mechanisms 3.1. Exercise snacks and energy metabolism 3.1.1. Effects of exercise snacks on energy metabolism Prolonged sedentary behavior is characterized by low energy expenditure, typically requiring approximately 1.5 metabolic equivalents (METs), which is equivalent to the energy expenditure while sitting or lying down. 15 Epidemiological studies indicate that adults spend approximately 55%–60% of their time, engaged in sedentary behaviors, which is an important risk factor for diseases such as cardiovascular diseases and metabolic syndrome . 16 , 17 For instance, extended sedentary periods decreases insulin requirements for glucose clearance. 18 These findings stress the need for effective interventions to break the spiral of prolonged sedentary behavior and modulate energy metabolism, thereby mitigating the risk of disease development . Physical activity following prolonged sedentary behavior is associated with reduced postprandial blood glucose , insulin, and triglyceride (TG) levels. 19 Breaking sedentary behaviors with brief high-intensity sprint interventions, lasting only 4\xa0\u200bs per hour, can significantly reduce plasma TG concentrations and enhance fat oxidation the following day, 20 suggesting that exercise snacks may impact metabolic conditions in sedentary populations. When individuals accumulate approximately 8 000 daily steps and engage in 1\xa0\u200bh of running or high-intensity interval training (HIIT) exercise, postprandial plasma TG levels are reduced while fat oxidation is increase on the next day, a phenomenon known as the ‘exercise response.’ Conversely, individuals accumulating only 2 000–4 000 daily steps and engaging in 1\xa0\u200bh of running exercise do not experience reductions in postprandial plasma TG levels or increases in fat oxidation on the following day, a phenomenon referred to as ‘exercise resistance\'. 20 , 21 Therefore, prolonged sedentary behavior appears to be an obstacle to improving fat metabolism after 1\xa0\u200bh running exercise. Remarkably, this ‘exercise resistance’ can be overcome by accumulating 8 500 daily steps by walking or by interrupting 8\xa0\u200bh of sedentary behavior with hourly sprint exercises. 22 Their findings were confirmed independently by Wolfe et\xa0al., who employed an experimental design involving an 8 h sedentary control group and a sprint exercise group performing 5 bouts of 4 s bicycle sprints every hour for 8\xa0\u200bh. 20 The exercise group exhibited a 43% increase in fat oxidation rate and a 31% reduction in plasma TG levels after consuming a high-fat meal the next morning. It is worth noting that although the trial involved 20\xa0\u200bs of exercise per hour, the actual exercise duration was approximately 5\xa0\u200bmin per hour, as each 4 s sprint was followed by a 45 s rest period. 20 A later study also reported that hourly stair-climbing exercise snacks reduced postprandial free fatty acid concentrations. 6 Physical inactivity disrupts metabolic function, marked by elevated postprandial blood glucose and abnormal insulin responses . Concurrently, these aberrant post-meal blood glucose and insulin surges have been identified as pivotal factors in the genesis and progression of type 2 diabetes and its many complications. 23 Interventions aimed at breaking the sedentary cycle are positively correlated with reduced cardiovascular events. For example, engaging in short bouts of moderate to high-intensity physical activity mitigates the post-meal surges in blood glucose and insulin levels , 24 while brief periods of walking every 30\xa0\u200bmin to interrupt prolonged periods of sitting also reduces postprandial blood glucose and insulin levels; these approaches hold appeal for individuals grappling with obesity or insulin resistance. 25 , 26 Engaging in HIIT also has benefits in the management of blood glucose levels in type 2 diabetes . 27 HIIT involves brief yet intense exercise bouts, stimulating a myriad of physiological systems. Given the resemblance between exercise snacks and HIIT, some studies explored whether exercise snacks could also modulate blood glucose concentrations in people with diabetes. For example, Francois et\xa0al. randomly assigned nine participants to a cross-over exercise intervention, with the exercise snacks group engaging in 6 bouts of 1 min uphill walking (performed at 90% of their maximum heart rate) before meals, and reported that pre-meal exercise snacks reduced post-breakfast and post-dinner blood glucose concentrations within 3\xa0\u200bh, with these benefits persisting for up to 24 h post-exercise. 8 These results suggest that exercise snacks attenuate the postprandial surges in blood glucose in insulin-resistant individuals, potentially diminishing their susceptibility to diabetes. A study by Hasan et\xa0al. evaluated the impact of exercise snacks in sedentary adolescents with type 1 diabetes ; however this intervention did not alter either blood glucose or hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels, although the daily engagement in exercise snacks reduced insulin requirements, signaling the potential for exercise snacks to enhance insulin sensitivity . 28 In addition, exercise snacks also reduced body fat, particularly in the trunk region, an area known to be an important contributing to insulin resistance ( Table\xa01 ). 29 Table\xa01 .

Possible mechanisms for the improvement of energy metabolism by exercise snacks Skeletal muscle is the largest glycogen reservoir in the human body and plays an important role in insulin-mediated regulation of blood glucose concentrations. 30 However, exercise enhances insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle (leading to improved blood glucose control) through complex mechanisms. 31 Recent studies have demonstrated that brief, intense bouts of exercise can markedly increase muscle glycogen consumption and activate skeletal muscle insulin-related signaling pathways , leading to enhanced insulin sensitivity. 32 Additionally, the decrease in muscle glycogen by 20%–30% triggered by such short, intense activities is likely to contribute to reductions in blood sugar levels and insulin resistance. 33 To meet these outcomes, it\'s essential for participants to sustain a high-intensity state throughout the exercise, a requirement that is fully in line with the principles of exercise snacks. 12 Furthermore, short-duration, high-intensity exercise activates intracellular signaling pathways associated with glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) translocation, including mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type II (CaMK II), all of which contribute to the transient hypoglycemic effects of acute intense interval exercise ( Fig.\xa02 ). 34 In addition to these molecular signaling pathways, the upsurge in skeletal muscle microvascular density due to exercise also aids in glucose transport (See Table\xa02 ). 35 Download: Download high-res image (448KB) Download: Download full-size image Fig.\xa02 . The potential mechanisms by which exercise snacks improve physical fitness. Exercise snacks have the ability to lower blood glucose and accelerate fatty acid oxidation . Exercise regulates the translocation of glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) through AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type Ⅱ (CaMK II), speeding up the absorption of glucose by skeletal muscles, thereby improving insulin sensitivity and lowering blood glucose . Additionally, exercise snacks can increase the level of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) in the serum. The elevation of LPL can enhance the breakdown of very low-density lipoprotein-TG (VLDL-TG) in the body, accelerating the clearance of TG . High-intensity exercise snacks increase the density of capillaries and the content of mitochondria in the body, leading to an increased rate of gas exchange in skeletal muscles and ultimately resulting in an increased peak oxygen consumption (V̇O 2peak ). Lastly, exercise snacks can increase muscle strength and muscle cross-sectional area, possibly due to the regulation by the AMPK/PGC-1α signaling pathway . Alterations in glucose and insulin levels typically occur on the day of the exercise or within a limited period post-meals, while changes in blood lipids are of commonly observed on the subsequent day. 36 This phenomenon correlates with lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity, a primary mechanism responsible for the postprandial reduction in plasma TG, and which typically reaches its zenith approximately 8\xa0\u200bh after exercise. 37 In actuality, prolonged sedentary behavior inhibit LPL activity, while a single bout of rigorous exercise increases LPL activity by augmenting TG clearance. 38 Furthermore, the hydrolysis of triglycerides in very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) reduces the rate of VLDL-TG secretion from the liver in sedentary men, resulting in a reduction in intra-organ TG content ( Fig.\xa02 ). 39 , 40 , 41 Gabriel et\xa0al. have proposed that LPL activity might be contingent on skeletal muscle fiber type, while the swift recruitment of fibers during short-duration, high-intensity physical activity could be a contributing factor to heightened LPL expression and hastened TG clearance. 42 In summary, the potential mechanisms underlying the impact of exercise snacks on energy metabolism involve adaptive changes in skeletal muscle which are closely related to muscular responses observed during high-intensity exercise ( Table\xa01 ). 3.2. Exercise snacks and aerobic capacity 3.2.1. Effects of exercise snacks on aerobic capacity Cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) describes the maximum volume of oxygen absorbed, transported, and utilized in the bloodstream during intense physical activity, 43 and is an indicator of an individual\'s aerobic capacity , commonly quantified by maximal oxygen consumption (V̇O 2max ) or peak oxygen consumption (V̇O 2peak ). There is a robust inverse correlation between CRF and mortality from cardiovascular diseases, surpassing the well-known positive associations of conventional risk factors such as smoking and type 2 diabetes. 44 CRF can be improved by structured exercise training or regular physical activity, as shown in recent studies on the potential ability of exercise snacks to enhance CRF in sedentary populations. While the corpus of research on this topic remains somewhat limited, these studies highlight the potential of exercise snacks as an additional strategy to improve cardiovascular health in sedentary adults. 5 A pioneering study by Jenkins et\xa0al. used exercise snacks intervention to monitor changes in cardiorespiratory fitness in sedentary individuals. 11 This study divided sedentary participants into two cohorts: a control group maintaining their pre-existing activity levels and an exercise group engaging in a program of exercise snacks. The exercise group partook in three daily bouts of exercise snack sessions, each separated by intervals lasting 1–4\xa0\u200bh. Prior to engaging in exercise, participants completed a warm-up routine comprising 10 jumping jacks, 10 squats, and 10 lateral lunges. Following this warm-up, participants underwent 1-min of low-intensity walking, then ascending as many as 60 flights of stairs in a three-story building. After the 6-week intervention period, the exercise group improved their V̇O 2peak (by 5%) and peak power output (by 12%). These findings were supported by another study in which 12 sedentary subjects who performed 3 sets of 20-s all-out sprint cycling sessions, spaced 1–4\xa0\u200bh apart, over a 6-week period had improvements in V̇O 2peak (by 4%) and peak power output (by 15\xa0\u200bW). 14 Remarkably, the benefits derived from a conventional sprint interval training (SIT) session did not differ from the exercise snacks group, suggesting that the effectiveness of multiple dispersed exercise sessions throughout the day may be sustained. 5 Multiple studies indicate that exercise intensity may be closely linked to CRF. 45 , 46 Compared to moderate intensity, high-intensity exercise methods might more effectively stimulate vascular function, thereby improving the CRF of the exercising population. Both of the aforementioned trials met the criteria for vigorous exercise snacks (∼85% of maximum heart rate), and there was no difference in CRF indicators between the SIT and exercise snack groups. This suggests that high-intensity exercise snacks could be one of the reasons for improvements in CRF. In summary, vigorous exercise snacks regimens have the potential to enhance CRF and exercise capacity in infrequently active adult populations. Although they may not strictly adhere to established physical activity guidelines, the accrued benefits of integrating exercise snacks into a weekly exercise regimen improves overall health. 3.2.2. Possible mechanisms of enhanced aerobic capacity by exercise snacks The physiological mechanisms underlying the changes in V̇O 2peak following short-term high-intensity exercise remain unclear, and may be associated with the nature and duration of the exercise intervention. 12 Engaging in low-intensity exercise for 150\xa0\u200bmin per week for 24 weeks may not yield notable improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness for adults, whereas low-volume, high-intensity exercise interventions improves peak oxygen consumption in sedentary individuals. 47 Furthermore, some studies suggest that the augmentation of peak oxygen consumption by sprint interval exercise may be attributed to the peripheral muscle\'s capacity for oxygen uptake, a portion of which is facilitated by increased blood flow . 48 Prolonged periods of sedentary behavior, characterized by extended periods of sitting, often leads to vascular dysfunction, and reduced peripheral blood flow , 49 while there is a 32% increase in blood flow velocity in the femoral artery of individuals engaging in daily fragmented stair climbing exercise compared to their sedentary counterparts. 4 The augmentation of blood flow aligns with exercise intensity implies that improvements in peak oxygen consumption with high-intensity exercise snacks may be attributed to greater peripheral blood flow, which in turn facilitates the delivery of oxygen to the skeletal muscles ( Table\xa01 ). 45 , 50 The mechanism behind this phenomenon may be related to an increase in capillary density and mitochondrial content. 51 Furthermore, the increase in V̇O 2max after high-intensity exercise is largely due to an increase in red blood cell volume and stroke volume . 52 However, it is challenging to closely link exercise intensity with cardiovascular adaptation, primarily due to factors such as the subjects involved in the study, the research plan, and the training methods used during the experimental process. 53 3.3. Exercise snacks and muscle strength 3.3.1. Effects of exercise snacks on muscle strength Prolonged periods of sedentary behavior are associated with decreases in skeletal muscle mass, which is particularly evident when total daily sitting time exceeds 360\xa0\u200bmin; nevertheless, regular physical exercise improves skeletal muscle mass. 54 While consistent physical activity can improve muscle mass, older adults often face challenges due to lower physical fitness and several risk factors associated with chronic diseases . 13 These challenges can potentially hinder their participation in activities tailored for adults, underscoring the urgency of identifying exercise strategies suitable for older adults aimed at enhancing their muscle function. A growing body of evidence suggests that compared to traditional training modalities, low-dose exercise patterns (i.e., high volume, low load), particularly when conducted without exercise equipment, enhances muscle strength in older adults. This approach help to mitigates various barriers to exercise participation by the elderly, while simultaneously enhancing the flexibility and feasibility of exercise programs. 55 A study of the suitability of a 4-week resistance-based exercise snacks program (administered once, twice, or thrice daily; compliance rate of 87%) in older adults that included balance tests, sit-to-stand tests, and 30 s sit-to-stand tests, reported that 75% of the participants in the exercise group found the exercise snacks regimen acceptable, indicating its feasibility among older adults. 56 However, there were no significant changes in the physical function of older adults after the 4-week exercise snacks program, indicating the need for further studies of optimal conditions for the use of resistance-based exercise snacks to improve physical function in older adults. In contrast, another study examined the effects of exercise snacks in older participants performing 5 sets of 1 min exercise interventions in the morning and evening (with a 1 min intervals between exercises). 13 The exercise-snacks included 1 min sit-to-stand tests, seated knee extensions of alternating legs, standing knee bends of alternating legs, marching on the spot, and standing calf raises. The exercise group had a 31% improvement in the 1 min sit-to-stand test, along with a 6% increase in maximum leg lift strength and a 2% increase in thigh muscle cross-sectional area, indicating that 4 weeks of resistance-based exercise snacks performed twice daily can enhance leg muscle strength and increase muscle size in older adults. Additionally, there was no significant change in the RPE values of the subjects before and after exercise, indicating that resistance exercise snacks, as compared to traditional resistance exercises, have a lower intensity. However, this does not affect their effectiveness in improving muscle mass. While the underlying mechanisms of these changes remain unclear, it is evident that high-frequency, short-duration exercise snacks can improve exercise feasibility in older adults, with the added benefit of ensuring their safe participation in physical activities. 3.3.2. Possible mechanisms of enhanced muscle strength by exercise snacks Resistance exercise is regarded as the “gold standard” for promoting muscle mass and strength. It involves repetitive contractions against external resistance, which increases myofiber satellite cell populations and the synthesis of myofibrillar proteins. This, in turn, leads to an enlargement of myofiber cross-sectional area and increased muscle strength. 57 However, the specific mechanisms underlying muscle hypertrophy and strength gains resulting from resistance-based exercise snacks patterns remain unclear. Some studies suggest that short-duration, high-intensity exercise differs in its neuromuscular characteristics from traditional aerobic exercise, as short-duration, high-intensity exercise increase conduction velocity of muscle fibers more effectively. Furthermore, as exercise intensity escalates, the activation of type II muscle fibers is heightened, leading to a more pronounced myofiber hypertrophy. 58 , 59 , 60 However, it must be noted that while brief high-intensity exercise is very important for stimulating muscle growth, there is still a lack of understanding and research regarding the frequency of such activities. This lack of knowledge might lead to a potential “threshold” in assessing the volume of resistance exercise. 61 Therefore, in resistance exercise, giving each skeletal muscle excessive repetitions and sets, thereby increasing the total volume of exercise, might not provide additional benefits to the body. 55 In this context, exercise snacks, characterized by high frequency and low volume, could be an effective alternative to traditional resistance exercises for stimulating physiological adaptations in the body. Thus, the improvement in muscle mass from resistance exercise snacks might benefit from the characteristics of this training method, namely, its higher frequency and the cumulative effect of training volume on the body. It is well-known that in response to resistance exercise, skeletal muscle protein synthesis significantly increases and this response can persist for a long duration, possibly up to 24\xa0\u200bh post-exercise. Subsequently, the magnitude of protein synthesis begins to decrease. 62 Current physical activity guidelines recommend that adults engage in resistance exercises at least twice a week. 1 However, with a longer interval between these bi-weekly sessions, it is hypothesized that more frequent repetitions of resistance exercise could lead to more prolonged periods of net protein accretion in skeletal muscles. 61 Resistance exercise snacks, typically performed once or twice daily, may help maintain this increase in muscle protein. Although increasing the frequency of exercise may enhance skeletal muscle protein synthesis, due to the body\'s adaptability, it might be necessary to further increase the frequency to achieve greater muscle growth. Whether this hypothesis applies to older adults requires further research. Further research is needed to explore the effects of exercise snacks on muscle morphology and function, particularly in sedentary adult populations. Similar to other forms of short-duration, high-intensity exercise, despite its brevity, exercise snacks may involve the activation of classic intracellular signaling pathways (such as AMPK) and transcriptional regulator factors (such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha) involved in muscle oxidative remodeling, as is the case forms of short-duration, high-intensity exercise ( Table\xa01 ) ( Fig.\xa02 ). 5 , 63 4. Comparing exercise snacks to traditional exercise Traditional exercise interventions typically involve sustained aerobic and resistance training, which often is impractical for individuals facing health issues or time constraints. Approximately 50% of individuals tend to discontinue exercise programs within six months due to time limitations, motivational levels, and access to exercise equipment. 64 However, ‘lack of time’ consistently emerges as a primary reason for reduced exercise participation and volume. 10 HIIT is a convenient and effective alternative approach for sustaining physical activity, with a demonstrated ability to enhance cardiovascular health, leading to health benefits that surpasses gained from traditional aerobic exercise. 65 It is important to recognize that HIIT necessitates specific free time and access to specialized exercise facilities, and that adherence to standard HIIT routines can be demanding, and suboptimal intensity levels could compromise its effectiveness. Therefore, a key distinction between exercise snacks and HIIT sessions appears to be that exercise snacks can be performed more repetitively or frequently throughout the day, without the need for any equipment. In contrast, exercise snacks involve shorter, more frequent bouts of physical activity dispersed throughout the day. This approach offers a pragmatic strategy for augmenting overall physical activity while simultaneously reducing sedentary behavior. 66 To evaluate the viability of exercise snacks regimens, a study that spanned 12 weeks involving 15 older adults aged between 60 and 89 years (all of whom had at least one chronic condition) reported that the flexibility of exercise snacks (consisting of 2–4 brief bouts of physical activity, each lasting no more than 10\xa0\u200bmin per day) was a compelling feature as it seamlessly integrated into their daily routines due to its manageable time commitment. Additionally, participants reported experiencing gains in strength, flexibility, and balance, which served as motivational factors for sustained engagement in the exercise snacks program. 66 5. Conclusion and remaining issues In comparison to traditional forms of exercise, exercise snacks is a viable, time-efficient, and convenient strategy that lead to improvement in cardiovascular fitness, metabolic capacity , and muscular function in sedentary individuals. The mechanisms underlying the benefits of exercise snacks on physical function and exercise capacity are likely related to its short duration and high intensity, allowing for the rapid mobilization of various organ systems that fosters enhanced utilization of oxygen and glucose by skeletal muscles, promotes muscle protein synthesis , and augments muscle fiber conduction velocity. However, we must acknowledge that there are still some unresolved issues with exercise snacks. Research on exercise snacks interventions has predominantly been conducted in controlled environments, such as laboratories or homes. However, there remains a dearth of data from communal settings such as educational institutions, retirement homes for the elderly and workplaces where sedentary populations typically gather. Secondly, the concept of exercise snacks lacks a universally accepted and standardized definition. Given the parallels between exercise snacks and other brief, high-intensity exercise modalities, future efforts should concentrate on establishing criteria based on time and intensity factors. This will serve to effectively differentiate exercise snacks from other exercise forms. Finally, while an abundance of studies have attested to the efficacy of exercise snacks in augmenting physical function and exercise capacity, current investigations primarily operate at the macroscopic level. Regrettably, there exists a paucity of research delving into molecular mechanisms that underlie adaptive changes in physical function resulting from exercise snacks.

This review explores various hypotheses regarding the pathogenesis of OTS, including glycogen depletion, dysregulated cytokine response, oxidative stress, and alterations in the autonomic nervous system function. It also highlights the systemic impact of OTS on multiple organ systems, immune function, and overall health, linking the condition to chronic inflammation and an increased disease susceptibility. Additionally, it addresses the role of the gut microbiome in health modulation through physical activity. This narrative review was conducted through a structured search of peer-reviewed journal articles in databases such as PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar, focusing on studies involving human participants and published in English. OTS has systemic effects on multiple organ systems, immune function, and overall health, leading to chronic inflammation and increased disease susceptibility. Athletes with OTS exhibit higher morbidity rates, influenced by factors such as sleep deprivation and stress. The review also emphasizes the role of the gut microbiome as a significant modulator of health through physical activity. Balanced training and recovery are crucial for preventing OTS and maintaining optimal health and quality of life in physically active individuals. Understanding the complex pathophysiology of OTS is essential for developing effective prevention and treatment strategies.

Although regular exercise has been shown to improve glycemic control in individuals with T2DM, conventional exercise recommendations are not always feasible for patients due to time constraints. Therefore, “exercise snacking’’, which involves short bouts of exercise interspersed throughout the day, has emerged as a potential alternative to traditional exercise regimes. However, optimal intensity, amount, frequency and/or type of “exercise snacking’’ for individuals with T2DM remains unclear. The purpose of this three-arm randomized crossover study is to examine the acute effects of different “exercise snacking” modalities on cardiometabolic factors and mental health. Methods Ten sedentary patients (five males and five females, age range: 18–45 years; body mass index (BMI) range: 25–35 kg/m 2 ) diagnosed with T2DM without additional diseases will be recruited. In this crossover study, participants will receive all of the following interventions in a random order: (1) three short sessions of 6\u2009×\u20091 min of cycling at 90% of maximal heart rate (HR max ) (2) three short sessions of 1\u2009×\u200920 s of “all out’’ sprints at cycle ergometer and (3) no intervention. Glycemic parameters, blood pressure, rate of perceived extraction (RPE), adverse events, enjoyment and affect will be evaluated before and directly after each intervention. Discussion The results of this acute study have great potential to inform future public health efforts designed to improve glycemic control, increase exercise rates and affect overall health in individuals with T2DM. Trial registration The study was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT06146036) registred on 18 December, 2023. Peer Review reports Background The prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) continues to increase alarmingly, with 642\xa0million patients predicted by 2040, posing an enormous economic and social challenge [ 1 ]. In addition, previous studies [ 2 , 3 ] have shown that most patients with T2DM continue to spend considerable periods of the day in hyperglycemia despite pharmacological interventions. Consequently, patients with T2DM face an increased risk of diabetes-related complications as well as cardiovascular disease attributed to both, long-standing hyperglycemia [ 2 ] and postprandial hyperglycemia [ 3 ]. Therefore, effective and accessible interventions are crucial for preventing and treating for diabetes-related complications and increasing the life expectancy of T2DM patients. Exercise has been established as an essential nonpharmacological approach in the management of T2DM due to its multifaceted benefits on glycemic control including improved insulin sensitivity and enhanced whole-body glucose uptake [ 4 , 5 ]. In addition, previous studies [ 6 , 7 , 8 ] reported that daily acute exercise is of greater clinical importance for long-term improvements in glycemic control compared to chronic exercise adaptations to different exercise modalities. However, there continues to be debate which exercise modality is the most effective and tolerable for T2DM patients. Specifically, both resistance [ 9 ] and moderate continuous training (MICT) [ 10 ] result in enhanced glucose uptake that persists for up to 48 hours [ 11 ]. Furthermore, recent studies [ 12 , 13 ] suggest that higher glucose utilization and better glycemic control are strongly related to exercise intensity, meaning that traditional exercise programs may no longer be the “gold standard’’ for achieving better glycemic control. Unfortunately, within the field of investigation, several crucial questions remain unanswered and it is of great interest to focus on addressing these gaps. First, despite numerous benefits, the majority of individuals with T2DM do not exercise regularly. Challenges are complex and numerous but the most common reason is the lack of time [ 14 ]. To address the lack of time and intensity issues, High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) and Sprint Interval Training (SIT) protocols have become enormously popular among T2DM population as time-efficient and effective solutions [ 15 , 16 ]. The current literature on acute effects [ 17 , 18 , 19 ] suggests that the HIIT and SIT protocols are more effective than traditional exercise modalities for managing glycemic control with other clinically relevant benefits. Nevertheless, some authors [ 15 , 20 ] voiced concern about the time efficiency of these interventions (up to 60\xa0min), as well as the high perceived exertion responses and side effects associated with them. Consequently, poor adherence to these sessions is still a scientific and practical challenge. Finally, recent studies [ 21 , 22 ] have provided concrete evidence that breaking the entire workout session into several shorter sessions throughout the day resulted in better glycemic control among patients T2DM. Specifically, Reynolds et al. [ 21 ] and Pahra et al. [ 22 ] examined the effects of three separated bouts compared to one continuous bout and concluded that accumulated exercise was more beneficial for blood glucose regulation. However, it remains unclear how breaking the HIIT and/or SIT protocols can affect glycemic responses and outcomes such as enjoyment and affect. Thus, there is a growing interest in investigating the health benefits of short-duration intense exercise interventions in individuals with T2DM [ 15 , 23 , 24 ]. Given that increasing the level of physical activity among the T2DM population requires time-efficient training protocols, that better glycemic responses strongly depend on the intensity of the sessions, and that exercise interventions accumulated in the multiple short and intense bouts spread throughout the day showed promising effects - the concept of “exercise snacking’’ has emerged as a potential modality to enhance physical activity among healthy and clinical populations. Briefly, “exercise snacking’’ involves brief, very intense bouts of exercise throughout the day, challenging the conventional idea of continuous, prolonged, and stressful sessions [ 25 ]. Furthermore, “exercise snacking’’ provides a time-effective alternative and induces lower perceived stress compared to HIIT, as demonstrated by Stork et al. [ 26 ]. Additionally, previous research [ 27 ] has established that “exercise snacking’’ ensures safety, and can be seamlessly incorporated into daily routines, making them more feasible for the TD2M population. To date, a few studies [ 12 , 28 , 29 ] found that “exercise snacking’’ can significantly improve several health aspects including cardiorespiratory fitness and body composition. Moreover, engaging in short bouts of intense exercise showed a 38%– 40% reduction in all-cause and cancer mortality risk and a 48%– 49% reduction in cardiovascular disease mortality risk [ 30 ]. However, equivocal results have been found regarding glycemic control [ 12 , 31 ]. Thus, caution should be taken in interpreting the literature review regarding the efficacy of these modalities due to the study population and different methodological approaches. Moreover, there is a notable research gap in understanding the overall effects of different “exercise snacking’’ modalities on glycemic control in patients with T2DM. The type, intensity, and volume of these exercise bouts and how they acutely affect glycemic control are unknown and need further exploration. Therefore, the aim of this three-arm randomized crossover study is to examine the acute impact of different “exercise snacking” modalities in laboratory conditions on glycemic control in adults with T2DM. Further, we explore the effect of the “exercise snacking’’ on blood pressure, and mental health (i.e., enjoyment, and affect). Methods Ethical approval This study was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Faculty of Sport and Physical Education (ref. 04-1943/2; approval date: 5 December 2023), University of Niš, and will be conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Moreover, the study was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT06146036). Study design and procedures This study will be a randomized clinical trial with a crossover design. The protocol was written in accordanceith the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) guidelines. The complete copy of SPIRIT checklist is available in the supplementary material (additional file 1 ). Prior to the experimental protocols, participants will be asked to come to the laboratory on four different days, according to an individual schedule. During the first visit, the measurements will take place at the University Medical Centre (UMC) where an electrocardiographic stress test (ECG) will be performed to determine whether the participants can take part in the study. During the second, third and fourth visit, the measurements will take place in the laboratory of the Faculty of Sport and Physical Education. At the second, third and fourth visits, baseline testing will be conducted to examine anthropometric characteristics, cardiorespiratory fitness levels, and heart rate (HR) parameters, followed by the familiarization process. A detailed description of all assessments can be found in the pre-exercise interventions section. Regarding the main experimental protocol before each trial participants will be asked to avoid any strenuous exercise for at least 72\xa0h. After 7 days of baseline assessment, participants will come to the laboratory. Each of these trials will be separated by at least 5–7 days. Blood pressure, as well as rate of perceived exertion (RPE), enjoyment, affect, and adverse events will be measured before and after each protocol using the standardized equipment, questionnaires and rating scales (Fig. 1 ). Moreover, HR will be measured continuously during each exercise session. A detailed description of all assessments as well as experimental protocols can be found in the exercise interventions and primary and secondary outcomes. Figure\xa01 Standard protocol items: recommendations for interventional trials (SPIRIT). Legend: HIIT - high-intensity interval; RPE - rate of perceived exertion Full size image Initial recruitment An open invitation will be sent to diabetic associations and to the UMC. Additionally, participants will be recruited through posters, social media, and word of mouth. Then, an initial meeting will be held to inform all interested participants about the study and future ideas. After the initial meeting, both a contact phone number and email addresses will be provided for the participants to contact the research team and obtain additional information. Participants who contact the research team will be able to ask questions regarding the study and if individuals decide to proceed, they need to provide basic information about themselves (age, height, weight and diabetes duration) and complete the Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire-Plus (PAR-Q+). Participants will answer verbally, and each conversation will be recorded. Then, if the participant meets the eligibility criteria, we will invite them to an additional meeting where the research team will describe in detailed the study, objectives and safety of the participants. During this meeting, the participants will have to give their written approval for participation in the study. The complete graphical study design is shown in Fig. 2 . Figure\xa02 Graphical design of the study. Legend: HIIT - high-intensity interval training; HR max – heart rate maximum; CON– control group; Full size image Participants/eligibility criteria The following inclusion criteria will be applied: (a) 18–45 year old participants (five males and five females) who have been diagnosed with T2DM at least 3 months prior to the start of the study according to standard criteria; (b) body mass index (BMI) between 25 and 35\xa0kg/m 2 ; (c) inactive participants according to the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) (<\u2009150\xa0min of moderate-intensity activities per week or <\u200975\xa0min of vigorous-intensity activities per week or <\u2009600 metabolic equivalent of task (MET) minutes per a week) [ 32 ]; (d) participants receiving medical therapy (no more than two medications) and not undergoing exogenous insulin therapy; (e) participants free of injuries and without any contraindications to exercise or chronic diseases that might be disruptive with vigorous activity; and (f) participants who are stable on their current diabetes medications, with no recent changes in their treatment regimen. The following exclusion criteria will be applied: (a) participants undergoing exogenous insulin therapy or/and receiving more than two glucose-lowering medicaments; (b) highly physically active participants according to IPAQ results (>\u200975\xa0min per week of vigorous intensity activities achieving a minimum total physical activity at least 1500 MET minutes a week or ≥\u20097 days of any combination of walking, moderate intensity or vigorous intensity activities achieving a minimum total physical activity of at least 3000 MET minutes a week); (c) participants suffering from any of the additional chronic diseases (renal diseases, liver diseases, neuropathy, cardiovascular diseases, uncontrolled hypertension [SBP\u2009>\u2009160\xa0mm Hg and/or DBP\u2009>\u200990\xa0mm Hg after at least a 5-minute seated rest at the screening visit], history of respiratory disease including pulmonary hypertension or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, history of musculoskeletal or neurological disorders and other metabolic diseases) [ 15 ]; (d) a significant resting and/or exercise ECG abnormality at the prescreening visit, which, in the opinion of the cardiologist exposes the participant to risk by taking part in the main trial; (e) participants who are strictly prohibited by medical professionals from engaging in vigorous exercise. Sample size calculation To determine the required sample size, an a priori power analysis using G*Power software (G*Power, Version 3.1, Heinrich-Heine University Düsseldorf, Germany) was used considering a crossover design with three groups. Sample size estimates were based on previous studies [ 7 , 15 , 33 ] with a similar design and the same primary outcome (24– h mean blood glucose). Therefore, a sample size of 10 participants was deemed sufficient to detect a medium effect size (η² = 0.06–0.13) with a statistical power of 0.80 (β\u2009=\u20090.80) and an alpha level of 0.05 (α\u2009=\u20090.05). This medium effect size on 24– h mean blood glucose concentration is further supported by findings from previous meta– analysis [ 34 ] and given that exercise has potent insulin-sensitizing and glucose-lowering effects in individuals with T2DM. Randomization process The randomization process will be performed through www.randomization.com . The order of the participants will be revealed upon of prescreening and baseline assessments. Withdrawal, discontinuation, and stopping rules Participants can withdraw from the research at any time without having to give reasons. However, it would be preferable to explain why because of the follow-up data. Participants can also withdraw before the start of the protocol if the cardiologist decides that performing intensive exercise based on ECG screening is dangerous. Finally, a doctor or the principal investigator may withdraw participants at any time for health reasons and terminate the exercise sessions. Pre-experimental procedures Prior to the experimental protocols, participants will be asked to come to the laboratory on four different days, according to their individual schedules. At the first visit, an ECG test will be performed to determine whether participants can take part in the study. The test will be conducted, monitored and reviewed by a cardiologist. Written consent will be required for further inclusion in the study. Moreover, during the first visit, a flash glucose monitoring (fGM) device, FreeStyle, Libre 2 (Abbott Diabetes Care Inc, USA) will be inserted on the participant’s nondominant upper-arm (m. triceps) according to manual guidelines. The accuracy of the fGM devices will be validated using capillary vs. interstitial fGM measurements. Capillary measurements (Accu-Check; Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland) will be taken by each participant before each main meal and before sleep. During the second visit, participants will be tested for anthropometric characteristics (i.e., body height and body composition) and will undergo a maximal incremental test on cycle ergometer. Briefly, body height will be measured using a portable stadiometer (Seca 220; Seca Corporation, Hamburg, Germany) with a graduation of 0.1\xa0m while body composition will be examined using an InBody 770 (InBody Co., Ltd., Cerritos, CA, USA). Body composition will be assessed in a fasted state and the testing will be conducted in the morning hours (from 8.00 a.m. to 10.00 a.m.). Following a light breakfast, which will adhere to the guidelines outlined in the 2008 American Diabetes Association (ADA) dietary recommendations for T2DM [ 35 ], the maximal incremental test on the cycle ergometer (Monark 894E Pike Bike, Sweden) will be conducted to assess maximal aerobic capacity at peak exercise (VO₂ peak ). Additionally, HR will be monitored continuously throughout the test using the Polar Team System H7 (Polar Electro Oy, Kempele, Finland), while HR max will be utilized as a parameter to define the intensity of the exercise session which will not be performed in an all-effort manner. Participants will be also familiarized with wearing the HR monitors and using the RPE. Briefly, after a 5-minute warm-up at 50\xa0W, the intensity will be increased by 15\xa0W/min until the tempo could no longer be maintained at 50\xa0rpm. Cardiorespiratory fitness will be measured using a portable gas analysis system (Quark b 2 , COSMED, Italy), VO 2peak will be determined as the highest ten-breath rolling average and accepted if two or more of the following criteria were met: (1) voluntary exhaustion, (2) a plateau in VO 2 despite increasing intensity; (3) HR max within 10 beats of the age-predicted maximum. This protocol has already been used in patients with T2DM [ 15 ]. During the third visit and fourth visit, participants will be invited to attend to familiarization sessions to establish their capacity to execute both experimental protocols at prescribed intensity. Dietary standardization and glycemic control strategies The diet will not be controlled, as the study will be based on participants’ everyday life habits. This study will exclusively focus on the effects of two “exercise snacking” modalities on acute glycemic responses. Furthermore, to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia, capillary blood glucose levels will be measured before and after each exercise session. Participants will consume carbohydrates (30\xa0g of raisins or juice) if their blood glucose level prior to the session is <\u20095.6 mmol/L. However, if blood glucose exceeds 13.9 mmol/L, the session will be canceled [ 8 ]. Furthermore, if the blood glucose level at the end of the session is <\u20093.9 mmol/L, participants will consume 15\xa0g of carbohydrates, and glucose levels will be checked again after 20\xa0min. Finally, if blood glucose levels remain unchanged after 20\xa0min, participants will consume an additional 15\xa0g of carbohydrates [ 8 ]. Experimental interventions The HIIT protocol utilized in this study met the criteria of a Guideline for Reporting HIIT protocols (AGReHIIT) [ 36 ]. HIIT snacks After a short-term warm-up on the cycle ergometer (5\xa0min, the intensity will be determined by the participants themselves), short-term, intense bouts of cycling 6\u2009×\u20091\xa0min at 90% HR max with a minute of active break between bouts will be performed (at 50\xa0W). Recovery will last 3\xa0min, also at the self-paced intensity. The whole process will be repeated two more times during the day with intervals of 1–4\xa0h. We will utilize the identical exercise protocol implemented by Francois et al. [ 12 ]. For the Sprint snacking (Ss) group training will consist of three separate sprints on the cycle ergometer separated by 1–4\xa0h. The Ss exercise bouts will consist of a 2-minute warm-up followed by a 20-s sprint and then a 1-minute cooldown (three separate workout sessions each lasting 3\xa0min and 20\xa0s). The warm-up, cooldown, and recovery periods will all be performed at 50\xa0W. Each sprint will be performed at a resistance of 0.21\xa0N m/kg and include a 10-s period when participants will be advised to accelerate the number of rpm as fast as possible. This study will replicate the protocol established by Little et al. [ 28 ]. Control (CON) During CON, participants will come to the laboratory and remain sedentary throughout the entire period. Additionally, participants will be permitted to engage in reading or solving sudoku puzzles to minimize potential confounding stimuli that could influence blood glucose levels. Primary outcomes Glycemic control Glycemic control will be assessed using the methodology described by Metcalfe et al. [ 15 ]. Glycemic parameters: The 24– h mean blood glucose (mmol/L), time spent in hyperglycemia (percent (%) of the day spent above 10 mmol/L), incremental area under the curve (AUC) and glycemic variability will be monitored using fGM for each 24– h period (baseline day, exercise day, and day following exercise interventions). More precisely, time spent in hyperglycemia will be measured by the percentage time of the day spent above 10 mmol/L; AUC will be determined from the fGM data three hours following each main meal. AUC will be calculated using trapezoidal model. Postprandial blood glucose will be defined as mean blood glucose levels measured 180\xa0min after breakfast, lunch and dinner (3\xa0h– postprandial blood glucose). Finally glycemic variability will be determined by Excel Macro (Easy GV 9.0; available at http://www.easygv.co.uk ). The mean amplitude of glycemic excursions (MAGE) and standard deviation (SD) from the mean glucose [ 37 ] will be used for this purpose. Secondary outcomes Blood pressure Both systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) will be measured before and after exercise sessions using an automated device (Omron HEM-7130 ® ). Briefly, participants will be in a seated position and the bracelet will be attached around the participant’s left arm, above the elbow, and in alignment with the brachial artery. Rate of perceived exertion (RPE) RPE will be examined using the Borg Scale (0–10 scale) with 1– being very light and 10 being– maximum effort [ 38 ]. The RPE will be examined before and after each exercise session during the main experimental period. Adverse events Adverse events will be evaluated and classified into four different categories: (1) minor and temporary, (2) serious symptoms (potential risk of severe injury or life threatening, 3) manifest injury or disease and 4) death. The adverse event rate will be calculated for each participant as the total number of sessions during which any adverse events occurred divided by the total number of attended sessions. Mental health: exercise enjoyment The Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale (PACES) will be used to determine the perceived enjoyment after each exercise session. The PACES is an 18-item physical activity/exercise enjoyment scale in which participants are asked to rate “how you feel at the moment about the physical activity/exercise you have been doing” on a 7-point bipolar Likert scale with a total score of 126. Higher scores indicate greater levels of exercise enjoyment [ 39 ]. The PACES has been widely used in patients with T2DM [ 40 , 41 ]. Exercise enjoyment will be assessed immediately after each exercise session during the main experimental period. Mental health: positive and negative affect Positive and negative affect will be measured using the Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS). The PANAS consists of 20 items, with 10 items measuring positive affect and 10 items measuring negative affect on a 5-point Likert scale (1\u2009=\u2009not at all, 2\u2009=\u2009a little, 3\u2009=\u2009moderately, 4\u2009=\u2009quite a bit, 5\u2009=\u2009extremely) [ 42 ]. Positive and negative items are summed separately and both items range from 10 to 50. The total score is calculated by their sum. Higher scores in any of the positive and negative scales indicate higher levels of positive or negative affect, respectively. PANAS has been already employed in patients with T2DM [ 43 ]. Affect will be assessed before and after each exercise session during the main experimental period. Statistical analysis Statistical analysis will be performed using the IBM SPSS statistics program (version 26.0; Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The mean\u2009±\u2009standard deviation, Kolmogorov-Smirnov (normality of the distribution), and Levene’s (homogeneity of variance) tests will be determined for all outcome measures. Moreover, one-way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be performed to compare trial effects, and Bonferroni pairwise comparisons will be performed if any differences are identified. Sphericity will be analyzed with Mauchly’s test of sphericity followed by the Greenhouse–Geisser adjustment where required. In accordance with previous study [ 44 ] ordinal scale data will be analyzed by parametric statistical analysis. The significance level will be set at p <\u20090.05. Finally, effect sizes will be calculated using partial eta squared (η2) and reported as follows: small 0.01–0.05, medium 0.06–0.13, and large\u2009>\u20090.14 [ 45 ]. Discussion and practical application To the best of our knowledge, there are no comparative studies on patients diagnosed with T2DM. Therefore, we will conduct this study to determine the acute effects of two modalities of “exercise snacking’’ with different intensities and volumes with a particular emphasis on glycemic control. Moreover, this study will also examine blood pressure, individual responses to RPE, adverse events, exercise enjoyment and affect which is crucial for implementing protocols that contains intense exercise. “Exercise snacking’’ is a relatively new exercise modality with a great potential among sedentary clinical population. The advantages of this form of exercise are demonstrated by the fact that the exercise can be conducted outside of the laboratory without equipment and/or supervision. Although “exercise snacking” can chronically affect cardiometabolic health [ 12 , 28 , 29 ], little is known about acute effects. Indeed, understanding the immediate impact of these short, high-intensity bouts on glycemic control is crucial for people with T2DM especially when taking into account that individuals with T2DM exhibit significant intraday fluctuations in glucose levels, raising concerns about the safety and feasibility of certain exercise interventions. Existing studies [ 12 , 31 , 46 ] investigating acute effects of new developed modality of exercise on glycemic control are limited and have provided contradictory findings. More precisely, Rafiei et al. [ 46 ] showed that intense bouts consisted of 15–30\xa0s stair “climbing snacks’’ once per hour are effective for lowering insulin across the day in overweight and obese individuals. These findings are congruent with work of Francois et al. [ 12 ] which found reduced postprandial blood glucose levels and subsequent 24– h mean blood glucose concentrations after two different “exercise snacking’’ modalities in individuals with insulin resistance. Conversely, Godkin et al. [ 31 ] that 3\u2009×\u20091-minute bouts of stairs climbing did not affect changes in glycemic control (24– h mean blood glucose levels, postprandial blood glucose levels and time spent in hyperglycemia) among T2DM population. However, the different study designs, intervention characteristics (i.e., activity, duration, and intensity) and populations assessed within studies make it difficult to compare the results between studies. Despite the limited and contradictory findings regarding glycemic control, it is noteworthy to highlight several mechanisms that may explain how “exercise snacking” has the potential to acutely improve glycemic control. Specifically, these mechanisms include increased muscle glycogen utilization and the activation of insulin-related signaling pathways within skeletal muscle, which ultimately enhances insulin sensitivity [ 47 ]. Furthermore, these short but intense exercise bouts can result in a 20–30% reduction in muscle glycogen levels and contribute to a decrease in blood glucose and a reduction in insulin resistance [ 48 ]. To induce these significant changes, it is crucial for participants to maintain a high-intensity effort during the exercise, aligning with the principles of “exercise snacking’’[ 49 ]. Finally, brief but intense exercise bouts activate intracellular signaling pathways associated with the translocation of glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4), including mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMK II) [ 50 ]. These pathways collectively may contribute to the temporary hypoglycemic effects. Furthermore, existing research on “exercise snacking” has not investigated psychological and affective responses, especially within clinical population. These facts are supported by the work Islam et al. [ 25 ] which highlighted patient acceptance as a crucial factor for wider adoption of “exercise snacking” approach. To address this gap, our study will specifically examine these crucial psychological and affective aspects within a clinical context, providing valuable insights into the feasibility of “exercise snacking’’. Thus, it is necessary to determine how the different exercise intensity, number of bouts and specific activity affect the intended effects. Finally, this study could provide a strong and promising clinical basis for the future use of “exercise snacking’’ modalities among patients with T2DM and prescribed guidelines. Additionally, it would be interesting to examine how these “exercise snacks’’ affect glycemic control before or/and after meals and other cardiometabolic outcomes in sedentary patients with T2DM. Therefore, our results will lead to potential new questions and new ideas for randomized and follow-up studies in patients with T2DM.

Healthy, young, inactive adults ( n :\xa042, age: 21.6\xa0±\xa02.3 years, BMI: 22.5\xa0±\xa03.6\xa0kg·m −2 , peak oxygen uptake (VO 2 peak): 33.6\xa0±\xa06.3\xa0mL·kg −1 ·min −1 ) were randomly assigned to ES, MICT, or Control. ES ( n =\xa014) and MICT ( n =\xa013) groups performed three sessions per week over 6 weeks, while the control group ( n =\xa015) maintained their habitual lifestyle. ES involved 3 × 30\xa0s “all-out” stair-climbing (6 flight, 126 steps, and 18.9\xa0m total height) bouts separated by\xa0>1 h rest, and MICT involved 40\xa0min\xa0×\xa060%–70% HR max stationary cycling. A significant group\xa0×\xa0time interaction was found for relative VO 2 peak ( p <\xa00.05) with ES significantly increasing by 7% compared to baseline (MD\xa0=\xa02.5\xa0mL·kg −1 ·min −1 (95% CI\xa0=\xa01.2, 3.7), Cohen’s d =\xa00.44), while MICT had no significant effects (MD\xa0=\xa01.0\xa0mL·kg −1 ·min −1 (−1.1, 3.2), Cohen’s d =\xa00.17), and Control experienced a significant decrease (MD = −1.7\xa0mL·kg −1 ·min −1 (−2.9, −0.4), Cohen’s d =\xa00.26). MFO was unchanged among the three groups (group\xa0×\xa0time interaction, p >\xa00.05 for all). Stair climbing-based ES are a time-efficient alternative to MICT for improving CRF among inactive adults, but the tested ES intervention appears to have limited potential to increase MFO.

Adaptations to short, frequent sessions of endurance and strength training are similar to longer, less frequent exercise sessions when the total volume is the same. J Strength Cond Res 29(11S): S46–S51, 2015—The hypothesis that the distribution of weekly training across several short sessions, as opposed to fewer longer sessions, enhances maximal strength gain without compromising maximal oxygen uptake was evaluated. Twenty-nine subjects completed an 8-week controlled parallel-group training intervention. One group (“micro training” [MI]: n = 21) performed nine 15-minute training sessions weekly, whereas a second group (“classical training” [CL]: n = 8) completed exactly the same training on a weekly basis but as three 45-minute sessions. For each group, each session comprised exclusively strength, high-intensity cardiovascular training or muscle endurance training. Both groups increased shuttle run performance (MI: 1,373 ± 133 m vs. 1,498 ± 126 m, p ≤ 0.05; CL: 1,074 ± 213 m vs. 1,451 ± 202 m, p < 0.001). In contrast to CL, MI increased peak oxygen uptake (3,744 ± 615 mL·min −1 vs. 3,963 ± 753 mL·min −1 , p ≤ 0.05), maximal voluntary isometric (MVC) force of the knee extensors (646 ± 135 N vs. 659 ± 209 N, p < 0.001), MVC of the finger flexors (408 ± 109 N vs. 441 ± 131 N, p ≤ 0.05), and number of lunges performed in 2 minutes (65 ± 3 vs. 73 ± 2, p < 0.001). However, there were no significant differences between MI and CL on any measured parameters before or after the training intervention. In conclusion, similar training adaptations can be obtained with short, frequent exercise sessions or longer, less frequent sessions where the total volume of weekly training performed is the same.

Methods: Forty eight male sport students (mean (SD) age 21.4 (1.3) years) were divided into five homogeneous groups according to their maximal aerobic speeds ( v V˙ o 2 max ). Four groups participated in various training programmes for 12 weeks (two sessions a week) as follows: E (n \u200a=\u200a 10), running endurance training; S (n \u200a=\u200a 9), strength circuit training; E+S (n \u200a=\u200a 10) and S+E (n \u200a=\u200a 10) combined the two programmes in a different order during the same training session. Group C (n \u200a=\u200a 9) served as a control. All the subjects were evaluated before (T0) and after (T1) the training period using four tests: (1) a 4 km time trial running test; (2) an incremental track test to estimate v V˙ o 2 max ; (3) a time to exhaustion test (t lim ) at 100% v V˙ o 2 max ; (4) a maximal cycling laboratory test to assess V˙ o 2 max . Results: Training produced significant improvements in performance and aerobic capacity in the 4 km time trial with interaction effect (p<0.001). The improvements were significantly higher for the E+S group than for the E, S+E, and S groups: 8.6%, 5.7%, 4.7%, and 2.5% for the 4 km test (p<0.05); 10.4%, 8.3%, 8.2%, and 1.6% for v V˙ o 2 max (p<0.01); 13.7%, 10.1%, 11.0%, and 6.4% for V˙ o 2 max (ml/kg 0.75 /min) (p<0.05) respectively. Similar significant results were observed for t lim and the second ventilatory threshold (%V˙ o 2 max ). Conclusions: Circuit training immediately after individualised endurance training in the same session (E+S) produced greater improvement in the 4 km time trial and aerobic capacity than the opposite order or each of the training programmes performed separately. maximal oxygen uptake combined training distance running performance strength circuit training https://doi.org/10.1136/bjsm.2004.015248 Statistics from Altmetric.com See more details Picked up by 9 news outlets Blogged by 1 Posted by 5 X users On 2 Facebook pages On 2 videos 441 readers on Mendeley 1 readers on CiteULike Request Permissions If you wish to reuse any or all of this article please use the link below which will take you to the Copyright Clearance Center’s RightsLink service.

Hormonal responses to concurrent strength and endurance training with different exercise orders. J Strength Cond Res 26(12): 3281–3288, 2012—The purpose of this study was to examine the influence of the intrasession sequencing of concurrent strength and aerobic training on the acute testosterone (TT) and cortisol (COR) responses. Ten recreationally strength-trained young men (23.5 ± 0.9 years) performed 2 exercise interventions: aerobic-strength (AS) and strength-aerobic (SA), which consisted of 30 minutes of aerobic exercise on a cycle ergometer at 75% of maximal heart rate and 3 sets of 8 repetitions at 75% of 1 repetition maximum (1RM) in 4 strength exercises. Maximal heart rate was determined using a maximal incremental test on a cycle ergometer. Blood samples were collected before, between exercise modalities, and immediately after the concurrent training sessions to determine basal and acute total TT and COR concentrations. There were significant increases in TT after the first modality in both exercise orders ( p < 0.05). However, the TT level remained significantly higher than the resting levels after the second exercise modality only in the AS ( p < 0.05) which resulted in a significant higher relative total change after the complete concurrent training session compared with SA ( p < 0.05). Regarding COR, there were significant increases after the first modality in both AS and SA orders ( p < 0.05), but the COR returned to resting levels after the second modality in both AS and SA interventions. During AS and SA, the change observed after the first modality performance was greater than that after the second in both hormones. The present results suggest that the TT response is optimized after the AS order, whereas both AS and SA produced similar hormonal levels at all time points. However, it is important to state that the present results should be applied only when short duration and moderate intensity aerobic training is performed. Introduction Strength training is a powerful stimulus to the acute increase in concentrations of circulating testosterone (TT) and cortisol (COR). Several studies have investigated the influence of factors related to the training session in the acute hormonal responses to strength training, such as relative intensity to the maximum load (% of 1 repetition maximum [1RM]) ( 37 ), number of sets ( 39 ), interval length ( 31 ), muscle mass involved ( 21 ), and type of muscle contraction ( 28 ). These studies attempt to understand what factors may produce a hormonal response that favors the chronic adaptations to training, because there is some evidence to suggest that the hormonal response to individual training sessions is related to the magnitude of chronic neuromuscular adaptations to strength training ( 2,8,22 ). Although these factors have a critical influence on the magnitude and duration of the acute response of TT and COR to strength training ( 2,21,39 ), there is little data available in the literature regarding the influence of performing aerobic exercise combined with strength training on the acute response of TT and COR. Nevertheless, the simultaneous performance of both types of exercise (aerobic and strength) can generate a higher metabolic demand, resulting in a greater increase in COR, which could negatively influence the release of TT during the training session ( 6,13 ). Simultaneous performance of strength and aerobic training has been called concurrent training ( 4,5,10,14,20,27 ). Some studies have shown that aerobic training may negatively influence the development of strength that would normally result from strength training, and this effect has been called “interference effect” ( 4,10,20,27,32 ). This interference effect may be associated with the high volume and intensity of training and be explained by factors such as low muscle glycogen leading to a chronic catabolic state, antagonistic protein synthesis signaling ( 3 ), which ultimately interferes with the magnitude of muscle hypertrophy, especially in type I fibers ( 4 ); impairment of neural adaptations resulting from resistance training ( 10,20 ); and peripheral fatigue resulting from aerobic training which ultimately impairs strength performance ( 34 ). The interference associated with the chronic catabolic state may occur when a large volume of training is performed ( 4,5,32 ) which can lead to a steep rise in the resting levels of circulating COR, a hormone associated with protein catabolism, and a consequent imbalance among the anabolic hormones (i.e., TT, growth hormone [GH]) which stimulate protein synthesis and catabolic hormones (i.e., COR), thus producing an unfavorable environment for the development of muscle mass ( 4,5,32 ). In fact, some studies have observed the occurrence of the interference effect on developing strength and muscle mass, parallel to the increase in resting COR concentrations ( 4,5,32 ). In general, the role of hormone concentrations in the interference effect has been investigated by assessing the circulating TT and COR at rest ( 4,5,10,32 ). To the best of the author's knowledge, only 1 study has investigated the acute hormonal responses to a concurrent training session. Goto et al. ( 18 ) investigated the effect on hormonal responses of combining in the same training session an aerobic training protocol before a resistance exercise or perform resistance exercise alone. Although these authors found that the aerobic exercise suppressed the GH response to resistance exercise, aerobic exercise was found to have no influence on the response of COR or TT to resistance exercise. However, the exercise protocols used in the study by Goto et al. ( 18 ) resulted in no significant increase in these hormones. Moreover, the influence of manipulating the order of the modalities (i.e., strength and aerobic) on the pattern of acute responses of TT and COR in a concurrent training session remains to be elucidated. Because the performance of both modalities is very common by recreational exercise practitioners that aims to improve both muscle mass and cardiorespiratory fitness, it is important to determine the influence of the simultaneous performance of aerobic training and strength training on the acute hormonal response to strength training adaptations ( 12,33 ), especially when performing short volume and moderate intensity of aerobic and strength training interventions. Moreover, determining the best order in which to perform the training modalities during concurrent training, strength-aerobic (SA) or aerobic-strength (AS), and so optimizing a more anabolic hormonal response, could be an important factor in the prescription of concurrent training. Because of the lack of data in the literature, regarding the effect of the order in which the types of training are performed during concurrent training, the purpose of this study was to investigate whether this factor influences the acute response of TT and COR during a concurrent training session. Our hypothesis is that aerobic exercise performed before resistance exercise could negatively affect the acute TT responses. Methods Experimental Approach to the Problem To investigate the effect of exercise order manipulation on the acute hormonal responses to concurrent training, the subjects attended the laboratory sessions on 5 different occasions. On the first day, the subjects signed the written consent form, and their anthropometric characteristics were evaluated. On the second day, the 1RM test was performed to establish the reference to prescribe the strength training intensity. On the third day, a maximal incremental test was performed to determine the heart rate at maximal aerobic workload (HRmax), as parameter to the intensity of aerobic exercise. On the last 2 days, the concurrent exercise protocols, in which the exercise-type order was manipulated, were performed randomly, with 1 week of rest between them. All the subjects performed the strength and aerobic maximal tests at the same time of the day (between 8 and 10 am) and the 2 exercise orders at the same time of the day (between 8 and 9 am) throughout the period of the study. Subjects Ten young strength-trained men (mean ± SD : 23.5 ± 0.9 years), who were engaged in regular (4–6 times a week) and systematic training program for at least 3 months, volunteered for the study after completing an ethical consent form. The subjects were carefully informed about the design of the study with special information given regarding the possible risks and discomfort related to the procedures. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, and it is in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration. Exclusion criteria included any history of neuromuscular, metabolic, hormonal, and cardiovascular diseases. The subjects were not taking any medication with influence on their hormonal and neuromuscular metabolism and were advised to maintain their normal dietary intake throughout the study. The physical characteristics of the subjects are shown in the Table 1 . Body mass and height were measured using an Asimed analog scale (resolution of 0.1 kg) and an Asimed stadiometer (resolution of 1 mm), respectively. Body composition was assessed using the skinfold technique. A 7-site skinfold equation was used to estimate body density ( 26 ), and body fat was subsequently calculated using the Siri equation ( 23 ). Table 1: Physical characteristics.* Maximal Dynamic Strength Maximal strength was assessed using the 1RM in free-weight bench press, smith machine squat, lat pull-down, and bilateral knee extension exercises (World, Porto Alegre, Brazil). One week before the test day, at a prior session, the subjects were familiarized with all the procedures. On the test day, they warmed up for 5 minutes on a cycle ergometer and performed specific movements for the exercise test. Each participant's maximal load was determined in a maximum of 5 trials. A 4-minute rest was allowed between trials, and the performance time for each contraction (concentric and eccentric) was 2 seconds, controlled with an electronic metronome (KORG, Melville, NY, USA). The test-retest reliability coefficients (ICCs) were >0.97. Maximal Aerobic Test Heart rate at maximal aerobic workload was determined using an incremental test on a cycle ergometer. The participants began the test cycling at a 50-W load for 2 minutes, and this was increased by 25 W each 1 minute, while a cadence of between 70 and 75 rpm was maintained, until the participants claimed exhaustion or they were no longer able to maintain a cadence of over 70 rpm. The W max (in watts) was calculated using the formula: W max = W com + ( t /60)Δ W , where W com is the load at the last stage completed, t is the time at the last incomplete stage, and Δ W is the load increment in the last stage (25 W) ( 25 ). The heart rate at maximal workload was measured using a Polar T61transmitter and a FS1 wrist monitor (Polar, Kajaani, Finland). The test-retest reliability coefficient (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC]) was 0.88. Concurrent Training Protocols The performance of the different exercise orders, SA or AS, were determined randomly. During each experimental protocol, the subjects were advised to hydrate at will. Before the concurrent training sessions, the subjects performed a 5-minute warm-up at a comfortable cadence and performed specific muscle stretching and a specific warm-up, with 1 set of 25 repetitions with very light loads for the upper and lower body. Strength training lasted approximately 30 minutes and consisted of 3 sets of 8 repetitions at 75% of 1RM with 90 seconds of resting between sets. This intensity was chosen because it is commonly used by recreational strength training practitioners to promote muscle hypertrophy (70−85% of 1RM) ( 39 ). Strength exercises were performed always in the same order: bench press, squat, lat pull-down, and knee extension. During the aerobic training, the subjects performed 30 minutes of continuous exercise on a cycle ergometer at 75% of maximal heart rate. The total concurrent training session lasted approximately 1 hour. The total absolute load and the total number of repetitions and sets in both exercise orders were exactly the same ( Table 2 ). Table 2: Exercise protocols characteristics (mean ± SD ). Blood Collection and Analysis Blood was obtained between 8 and 9 am, after 8 hours of sleep, 12 hours of fasting, and 2 days with no physical training session. The time of blood collection was chosen because of its use in many studies conducted with these procedures for the control of the circadian hormonal range ( 7,9,32 ). The subjects sat in a slightly reclined position for 15 minutes, and after that, 10 ml of blood was drawn from the antecubital vein before, between exercise modalities (strength and aerobic), and immediately after the concurrent training session with similar techniques. After collection, the blood was maintained at an ambient temperature for 45 minutes and then centrifuged for 10 minutes at 2,000 rpm, and serum was removed and frozen at −20° C for later analysis. With this blood sample, concentrations of total TT (nanomoles per liter) and COR (nanomoles per liter) (MP Medicals, Twinsburg, OH, USA) were determined in duplicate, using radioimmunoassay kits. From these values, it was possible to calculate the TT/COR ratio. To eliminate interassay variance, all the samples were analyzed within the same assay batch, and all intraassay variances were ≤6.3%. Antibody sensitivities were 0.7 nmol·L −1 for TT, and 1.4 nmol·L −1 for COR. The test-retest reliability coefficients (ICC) were 0.85 for COR and 0.94 for TT. Statistical Analyses Results are reported as mean ± SD . Comparisons between different exercise orders were assessed using a 2-way analysis of variance with repeated measures (order × time). When a significant F value was achieved, Fisher's least significant difference (LSD) post hoc procedures were used to locate the pairwise differences. The relative range of the hormones after the concurrent training session was compared between exercise orders by using Student's paired t -tests. Also, Pearson's product moment correlation test was used to verify the associations between the variables analyzed. The sample size was calculated using the GPOWER program (version 3.0.1) that determined a sample of n = 10 subjects, with a statistical power of >85% in all variables. Significance was accepted when p ≤ 0.05. Results There were no significant differences in the TT and COR resting levels between the different experimental days ( Table 3 ). Table 3: Hormonal concentrations at rest and after the exercise protocols (mean ± SD ).* Regarding the absolute changes in the TT, there were a significant time-effect and time vs. order interaction ( p < 0.01) ( Figure 1 ). Testosterone increased after strength exercise was performed independently of interventions (in both SA and AS protocols). After AS, the TT value remained significantly higher ( p < 0.01) compared with that recorded at the resting level, whereas in the SA intervention, TT returned to the resting levels.

Moreover, in the first exercise modality (strength or aerobic exercise) of both interventions (SA or AS protocols), the acute relative TT change was higher than that observed after the second one (SA: 22.3 ± 23.5% vs. –12.9 ± 17.8% and AS: 31.8 ± 40.5% vs. 7.6 ± 18.2%; p < 0.05). In addition, the total relative change of TT (after the complete concurrent training session) was significantly higher in AS compared with the SA order (41.4 ± 47.8% vs. 3.3 ± 14.7%; p < 0.01). Comparing the hormonal responses with the same modality in the different orders, the relative TT response was higher after aerobic exercise in the AS compared with that in the SA ( p < 0.01). Relative TT response was also higher after strength exercises in the SA compared with that of the AS ( p < 0.05). Furthermore, the relative TT change after the second modality was significantly higher in the AS than in the SA order ( p < 0.05). In the COR levels, there was a significant time effect ( p < 0.05), with absolute increases being observed after the first exercise modality (strength or aerobic exercise) in both interventions (SA or AS protocols) ( Figure 2 ). After the second exercise modality (strength or aerobic exercise) in both AS and SA, COR concentrations returned to resting levels. In addition, no differences between the exercise orders were found in the relative total change of COR before and after total interventions (AS: 12.6 ± 21.5% and SA: 8.2 ± 27.8%). Notwithstanding, independent of the type of exercise modality (strength or aerobic exercise), in both interventions (SA or AS) relative changes during the first exercise modality were significantly greater than the second one (SA: 10.6 ± 23.6% vs. −2.1 ± 14.5%; and, AS: 11.5 ± 14.5% vs. 1.1 ± 14.1%; p < 0.05).

A significant time effect in both AS and SA ( p < 0.05) was observed in the TT/COR ratio.

During the SA, significant negative correlations were observed between resting levels of COR and corresponding individual total changes of TT ( r = −0.73, p = 0.016); COR and TT concentrations at midtime point ( r = −0.78, p = 0.007); COR and TT concentrations after the complete intervention (at posttime point) ( r = −0.80, p = 0.005); and significant negative correlations between, TT changes after the strength exercise and TT changes after the aerobic training ( r = −0.85; p = 0.002). In the AS, significant negative correlations were also observed between resting levels of COR and corresponding individual TT changes after aerobic exercise (midtime point) ( r = −0.76, p = 0.011); and with corresponding individual TT changes after strength exercise (posttime point) ( r = −0.87, p = 0.001). Discussion To our knowledge, this is the first study that examines the influence of manipulating the order of the exercises modalities (i.e., strength and aerobic) on the pattern of acute responses of TT and COR in a concurrent training session The main results of this study showed that regardless of the order of the modalities performed (SA or AS intervention) during a concurrent training session, the TT and COR responses are always higher after the first exercise modality (strength or aerobic exercise) than they are in the second. Moreover, the magnitude of the total TT response in the AS session was greater than that observed after the SA session, suggesting that the order of the exercise modalities (strength or aerobic exercises) can influence the acute TT response to the training session. Furthermore, there were negative correlations between COR levels and the magnitude of the TT responses, indicating that those subjects with lower levels of COR tend to have higher acute TT increases, and, therefore, COR may have an inhibitory effect on TT production. In a study performed by Goto et al. ( 18 ), the GH response to strength training was suppressed because of the prior performance of aerobic training. However, no differences were observed in the concentrations of TT and COR induced by strength training, with and without prior aerobic training performance. Nevertheless, in that study, the concurrent training sessions did not provide sufficient stimulus to induce increases in TT and COR. The differences between the results obtained by Goto et al. ( 18 ) and those of this study may be because of the lower intensity of the aerobic training in the former compared with the latter (50 vs. 75% of HRmax, respectively), lower volume of strength training (2 vs. 4 exercises, respectively), and the time at which the measurements were taken after the exercise protocol, 10 minutes in the study by Goto et al. ( 18 ) and immediately after the protocol in this study. When analyzing the second part of each training session, our results are in line with some results that compared the stimulus of strength and aerobic training on hormonal response. Some authors have shown that strength training seems to stimulate greater increases in TT and COR than aerobic training does ( 11,40 ), which can be explained by the powerful influence of the anaerobic glycolytic pathway in stimulating acute hormonal increases in response to exercise ( 33 ). In this study, this pattern only became evident in the second exercise of the training sessions, in which strength training resulted in a greater stimulus for TT when compared with aerobic training. The strength training session used in this study, in which the glycolytic pathway is predominant, has a great potential for stimulating TT. Therefore, there may be a direct stimulation of lactate in the testes, as demonstrated in a study performed by Lu et al. ( 35 ), who observed a correlation between the increase in TT and increase in lactate during an incremental protocol in rats. Furthermore, these authors demonstrated in vitro that the direct infusion of lactate in the testes resulted in a dose-dependent increase in TT. Thus, the aerobic exercise, after a session of strength training, may not have been able to further stimulate or maintain TT levels, because the intensity and possibly the metabolic impact were not maintained, which resulted in a lower total variation in TT levels after SA, when compared with the AS order. Another hypothesis that may explain the return to resting TT levels during the second modality in the SA order is the possible use of lactate accumulated during strength training as an energy substrate during the aerobic training ( 17 ), which would decrease the stimulus for TT. However, lactate concentrations were not measured in this study, so this hypothesis remains speculative. It should be also considered that the androgen receptor (AR) content was not measured in this study, and it is possible that changes in the circulating TT might have had an influence of the increased hormone-receptor interaction. Thus, the decrease in TT from mid to postexercise in the SA order might have been a result of increased receptor binding and not a decrease in secretion. In fact, it has been demonstrated that strength-trained subjects have increased numbers of ARs and also that strength training bout stimulates the acute increases in AR content ( 43 ). However, this hypothesis should be considered with caution and remains speculative. When the aerobic exercise was performed first during the AS intervention, it may have been sufficient to stimulate the TT of the subjects in this study, who are strength trained, but not aerobically trained. In fact, it has been demonstrated that the training status ( 1,9,29,40 ), and the type of training undertaken by individuals influence the hormonal response. In a study by Tremblay et al. ( 39 ), the increase in anabolic hormones was shown to be greater with strength training in strength-trained subjects, compared with that in aerobically trained individuals, whereas aerobically trained subjects had higher hormonal responses to aerobic exercise than strength-trained subjects had ( 40 ). Thus, one may suggest that with aerobically trained subjects, it is possible that the hormonal-response pattern to aerobic exercise could be different, possibly with that the subjects presenting higher values in response to the short duration aerobic exercise performed in this study ( 40 ), which would result in a different overall response to the total concurrent training session. Furthermore, the hormonal response to aerobic training can be explained by increased sympathetic activity during exercise ( 16 ) or even by greater vasodilation in the testes stimulated by increased release of nitric oxide resulting from the exercise ( 38 ). Thus, it is probable that aerobic trained subjects would perform the aerobic exercise in a higher absolute intensity, which would result in higher sympathetic activity and possibly altering the overall endocrine response ( 9 ). However, only recreational strength-trained subjects participated in this study, and this hypothesis remains speculative. Moreover, this speculation should not be applied when longer aerobic exercise is performed, because it has been demonstrated that TT can be suppressed in response to long duration aerobic exercise, especially during overtraining syndrome ( 32,33,41 ). Previous studies have shown a correlation between the acute response of TT to single training sessions and the magnitude of the increase in strength, power, and muscle mass resulting from chronic strength training adaptations ( 1,2,9,33 ). Besides the important role of TT in the synthesis of contractile proteins ( 19 ), and in the synthesis of neurotransmitters related to strength production ( 30 ), the increase in TT in response to strength training seems to be related to the magnitude of the increase in the number of ARs in human cells ( 43 ). Other studies in animal models demonstrated that the amount of ARs plays an important role in the magnitude of muscle hypertrophy ( 24 ). Thus, the manipulation of the various factors related to the training session that influence acute hormonal responses, such as volume and intensity ( 39 ), time interval ( 31 ), and muscle mass involved ( 21 ) can optimize the increase in TT in response to the training session. Regarding aerobic training, although the importance of the anabolic hormonal response is not well known, TT and COR seem to be more responsive to higher intensity ( 15 ) and longer duration of exercise ( 41 ). Thus, the short duration and moderate intensity aerobic protocol performed in this study might have been a limited stimulus to maintain the TT elevated after the strength training bout in SA. With respect to circulating COR, both training sessions caused a significant increase after the first exercise, with levels returning to normal after the end of the training sessions. Cortisol, which is responsible for 95% of glucocorticoid activity, is a catabolic hormone responsible for lipid and protein degradation and subsequent mobilization of energy substrate during exercise ( 42 ). Besides the metabolic impact related to time and exercise intensity ( 15,41 ), psychological stress may be responsible for an acute increase in COR ( 36 ). The fact that the subjects in this study were strength trained may explain the absence of modifications related to the longer duration of exercise, regardless of the order of execution of the modalities. Indeed, it has been demonstrated that the training status directly influences the magnitude of the adrenal cortical response with trained individuals presenting a significantly lower acute response when compared with the untrained ( 9,30 ). The purpose of this study was to investigate whether there are acute physiological differences in the response to different orders of exercise during concurrent training, to elucidate whether the order in which the exercises are performed influences the hormonal response when the volume and intensity of the exercises modalities are kept equal. The results of this study suggest that, if the objective is to optimize the response of TT to a concurrent training session, aerobic exercise before strength training can keep TT levels elevated for longer. On the other hand, caution is to be exercised in the interpretation and applicability of the results, because performing aerobic training before strength training can generate residual fatigue and impair the capacity to produce strength ( 34 ). In addition, although the AS session caused a higher and more persistent increase in total TT, both training sessions caused an increase in the TT/COR ratio. Nevertheless, the acute TT/COR ratio seems to be a very simplistic variable as an indicator of the balance between anabolism and catabolism ( 33 ). In this study, inverse correlations were observed between the initial levels of COR and the acute response of total TT ( r = −0.73 to 0.80, p < 0.05). Our results are in agreement with those of the study by performed Brownlee et al. ( 6 ), who observed an inverse correlation between the levels of COR and TT in response to aerobic exercise on a cycle ergometer and suggested COR may have an inhibitory effect on TT production. In fact, some studies have shown that the use of pharmacological COR has an inhibitory effect on the steroidogenic process in Leydig cells, via enzymatic inhibition ( 13 ) or by eliminating cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) production ( 42 ). Our findings are important because they suggest that the acute response of TT may be impaired in individuals with high COR levels, which could result in a limitation to the magnitude of the chronic adaptations to strength training, based on the importance of these levels for the increase in strength and muscle mass ( 2 ). In conclusion, the results of this study showed that the manipulation of the order in which the types of exercise are performed during a concurrent training session can influence the magnitude of the acute TT response, with the AS session showing a greater relative increase after the training session, which was not observed in COR. Based on the relationship, suggested in the literature, between acute hormonal responses and chronic neuromuscular adaptations to strength training, this could be positive for the optimization of muscle hypertrophy in the long term. However, the extent of the importance of this response in chronic adaptations to concurrent training remains speculative and further studies employing different volumes and intensities of training, and different populations are needed to determine whether the response observed in this study is, in fact, a pattern. Moreover, caution is to be exercised to interpret our results because, although the different concurrent exercise orders resulted in different acute TT responses, it did not produce differential hormone levels between interventions. Furthermore, the AR content was not measured in this study and the hormone-receptor interaction might have influenced the present results. Practical Applications Based on the relationship between acute hormonal responses and chronic neuromuscular adaptations to strength training, the present results are important because it suggests that moderate intensity, short duration aerobic exercise did not affect negatively acute TT responses to resistance exercise. In addition, it appears that performing the AS modality order might keep acute TT elevations for a longer period of time compared to the inverse order. Notwithstanding, it should be noted that only recreational strength-trained subjects participated in this study and it not possible to extrapolate these results to aerobic trained and sedentary subjects.

The sequences investigated are Endurance–Resistance (ER) and Resistance–Endurance (RE). A literature search is conducted of the SPORTDiscus and Medline databases. The included studies are randomized control trials, which compare the effect of ER and RE on at least one endurance performance variable. A PEDro scale is used to assess the methodological quality of the articles in this review. Of a total of 152 articles identified during the initial screening, 15 studies meet the inclusion criteria. These studies include 426 participants (298 males and 128 females), with 212 of the participants training with ER and 214 with RE. The results are presented as the percentage change of the mean from pre- to post-test. All the studies show an improvement in endurance from pre to post for both interventions, except for the RE group in one study. This review finds small and non-conclusive sequence effects between ER and RE, suggesting that the sequence of concurrent training is not of great importance in relation to endurance performance. Keywords: endurance performance ; concurrent training sequence ; endurance training ; strength training ; VO2max 1. Introduction Endurance athletes are constantly seeking more effective ways to improve their performance. Different approaches and methods can lead to enhancement, and different approaches affect athletes differently across various sports. When athletes and coaches are seeking further improvements in performance, a natural approach would be to make some adjustments to the training. For endurance athletes, this often means adjustment of the intensity, frequency, and volume [ 1 ]. However, another approach that has gained attention is the addition of strength training to the training routine. Studies have, over the last decade, highlighted the importance of implementing strength training in the training routine of endurance athletes to optimize their endurance performance [ 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 ]. The potential benefits of strength training in terms of endurance performance have been attributed to several factors, including improved exercise economy, anaerobic capacity, lactate threshold, maximal strength and speed, rate of force development, and increased time to exhaustion, while not showing any negative outcomes [ 6 , 9 ]. Improvements in endurance performance from strength training also seem to be similar for both males and females [ 7 ]. This suggests that endurance athletes should try to implement strength training into their weekly training routine to optimize their endurance performance. Studies have found interfering effects of concurrent strength and endurance training, suggesting that the concurrent training approach, compared to performing resistance training alone, could mitigate the gains in muscle mass, strength, and power [ 10 , 11 ]. The dose of endurance training is an important factor in relation to the interfering effect on strength training adaptations, as hypertrophy, power, and strength have been shown to be impaired by higher doses of endurance training more than lower doses [ 11 ]. Power is reported to be a major variable affected by concurrent strength and endurance training [ 11 , 12 ]. Furthermore, it is suggested that the velocity of the contraction during maximal effort might be an important factor concerning the magnitude of the interference [ 12 ]. The interfering effect, which can inhibit adaptation from the strength training, seems to be specific to the body parts used during the endurance training [ 11 ]. This was also confirmed in the meta-analysis by Sabag et al. [ 13 ], stating that incorporating high-intensity endurance training into the strength training routine did not negatively impact the upper body strength and hypertrophy, although negative effects were found mainly in the lower body. From an endurance performance perspective, it is important to note that strength and hypertrophy gains do not necessarily contribute to enhanced performance for endurance athletes when incorporating strength training into their routine. In weight-bearing endurance sports where the power-to-weight ratio significantly impacts performance, body mass is an important factor, and athletes can often be afraid to gain extra body mass due to fearing that it will negatively affect their performance [ 14 ]. Therefore, the addition of extra body mass caused by hypertrophy from strength training could have a negative effect on endurance performance. This concern was highlighted by Rønnestad and Mujika [ 6 ], who stated that the addition of strength training to an endurance training regime does not seem to cause a significant increase in total body mass, even though small increases in muscle hypertrophy in the main target muscles are often observed. Several previous studies have demonstrated reduced strength adaptations from performing endurance training concurrently with strength training, compared to strength training alone [ 15 , 16 ]. The homeostatic or metabolic and neuromuscular effects of endurance training might affect physiological responses and thereby also adaptations [ 17 ]. In general, it has been suggested that one should aim to separate the endurance from the strength training sessions optimally on different days to minimize the interfering effects, but, if possible, it is recommended to place the strength and endurance sessions with at least 6 h of recovery between them [ 18 ]. The sequence of same-session concurrent strength and endurance training have also proven to be an influencing factor concerning the training adaptations gained from concurrent strength and endurance training [ 15 , 16 ]. While strength training over time is likely to improve endurance performance and exercise economy [ 6 ], there is evidence that the sequence of endurance and resistance training acutely affects the determinants of endurance performance [ 19 , 20 ]. For example, it has been shown that even with six hours between strength and endurance exercise of a different order in running (strength–running and running–strength), resistance training six hours before endurance training impaired both the running economy and muscle force generation capacity [ 21 ]. When endurance exercise is performed after strength training without adequate resting time between workouts, the local muscle damage can reduce the running economy and consequently performance [ 20 , 22 ]. For many endurance athletes, limited time for training can be a challenge when planning their program. Full-time professional endurance athletes might not have the opportunity to dedicate a whole day to just strength training due to the high demand for a certain volume of endurance training, while amateur athletes often have work and other commitments that limit their time window for training, which forces them to train with little to no rest between the endurance and strength sessions. Considering the nuanced interplay between time constraints, performance outcomes, and sequencing in concurrent training, this review offers valuable insights for athletes, coaches, and researchers alike. By exploring the impact of the sequence of concurrent endurance and strength training, specifically comparing the effects of strength training followed by endurance training versus the reverse order, this review contributes practical knowledge to inform more effective and feasible training program designs. This brings up an important question regarding the planning of strength training in an endurance training routine. The aim of this review is to examine the impact of the sequence of concurrent endurance and strength training, specifically comparing the effects of strength training followed by endurance training versus endurance training followed by strength training, on endurance performance. 2. Materials and Methods This review used the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) 2020 updated guidelines as a framework to improve the transparency and reporting of the study [ 23 ]. While most of the checklist items were followed, relevant components that were appropriate for the research design, data sources, and analysis were included. 2.1. Literature Search In order to answer the research question, a literature search was performed using the SPORTDiscus and Medline databases on 29 February 2024. No starting year was set for the literature search. The search terms employed were as follows: (Endurance exercise OR endurance training OR aerobic exercise OR aerobic training) AND (Strength exercise OR strength training OR resistance exercise OR resistance training) AND (Sequence OR order) AND (Concurrent OR concomitant). Additionally, the search was restricted to peer-reviewed studies published in English. The initial search identified 149 articles. This process involved a single comprehensive search (one-step search) using all the specified search terms simultaneously. The articles then underwent a thorough screening process based on the pre-defined inclusion criteria. The screening process started with the removal of duplicates, and then headlines and abstracts were scanned for relevance. Studies that did not seem relevant based on the headline and abstract were excluded, while the studies that still seemed to be relevant went on to further analysis. The final step consisted of a full-text review of the article for the eligibility criteria, as shown in Table 1 . Furthermore, three additional studies were identified through citation searching from the reference lists of other studies and included in the analysis after undergoing the same screening process. Table 1. Participants, interventions, comparisons, outcomes, study (PICOS) design table describing the inclusion and exclusion criteria. 2.2. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria For this study, only training intervention studies were included, so no studies investigating acute effects were considered. To ensure an adequate timeframe for endurance and strength adaptations, a minimum intervention duration of eight weeks was established as an inclusion criterion. The selected studies were required to incorporate a concurrent training protocol performed sequentially. Specifically, studies had to include both an endurance training–resistance training (ER) sequence and a resistance training–endurance training (RE) sequence. There were no restrictions set regarding participants’ age or fitness level, as most studies were conducted on untrained participants. Studies that included participants with any mentioned diagnosis, illness or injury were excluded from the review. The studies had to include the pre-test and post-test for at least one endurance performance parameter, or an endurance performance test. 2.3. Review Process The screening process for this review was conducted by one of the authors, who assessed the identified studies based on the predefined eligibility criteria. All the studies identified from the initial search were first screened by reading the headline and skimming through the abstract. The second screening was performed by reviewing the full text of the selected studies for eligibility (see Figure 1 ). Figure 1. PRISMA flowchart describing the search, screening, and exclusion process for the studies included in this review. 2.4. Quality Assessment To assess the methodological quality of the articles in this review, a modified version of the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) scale [ 24 ] was used (see Table 2 ), where the criteria regarding blinding were excluded since they were deemed irrelevant for the methodological quality of the included studies. The criteria of the PEDro scale were reviewed for each article to determine whether they were satisfied. A points system was used for marking the criteria. A “+” indicated that the criterion was clearly stated and satisfied, a “÷” indicated that the criterion was not satisfied, and a “?” indicated uncertainty regarding whether the criterion was satisfied. Only studies that scored a minimum of 5 points on the PEDro scale were included in this review, ensuring a baseline level of methodological quality. Table 2. The modified PEDro scale used for the quality assessment. “+”, criterion satisfied; “÷”, criterion not satisfied; “?”, unclear whether criterion is satisfied. The criteria regarding blinding were dimed irrelevant due to being n/a (not applicable). The arrow “↓” in the total score row indicates the criteria listed below. 2.5. Data Extraction The lead author conducted the extraction and compilation of data from the included studies, converting the information into two comprehensive spreadsheet tables. The extracted data covered aspects like the weekly frequency of strength and endurance sessions, the duration of the transfer time between sessions, and specifics of the training protocols for both the strength and endurance sessions, as elaborated in Table 3 . Table 3. Summary of the training interventions used in the included studies. Additionally, each study’s data encompassed details such as the number of participants, sex distribution, age demographics, training status descriptions, intervention duration, and results of endurance tests for both the ER and RE groups. A detailed breakdown of this information is provided in Table 4 . Table 4. Description of the participants, duration of the intervention, and results of each included study. 2.6. Participants The 15 included studies involved a total of 426 participants, with 212 following the ER protocol and 214 the RE. Out of the 426 participants, there were 298 males and 128 females. The age and training status varied a lot across participants, but no studies were conducted on elite or professional athletes. From the descriptions in the studies, they were described as everything from untrained to physically active, with no mentioned underlying health issues. 2.7. Statistical Analyses This systematic review refrains from conducting a meta-analysis or statistical analyses due to the significant variations in the endurance tests performed across the included studies and the heterogeneity in the presentation of data. Results from the individual studies are reported in Table 4 as the percentage change of the mean values from pre- to post-test. The level of significance, denoted by asterisks and a section symbol, indicates significant differences: * = 0.05 (pre-post), ** = 0.01 (pre-post), and § = 0.05 (between-group), marking studies with significant pre-post or between-group differences when mentioned in the studies. 3. Results 3.1. Study Characteristics The studies included in this systematic review showed variation in their intervention protocols and participant characteristics. In terms of the participant demographics, the studies included both male and female subjects with varying age ranges. In five of the studies, the participants are described as young or students, with an age span ranging from teenagers and participants in their early 20s in some of the studies, to participants with an average age of over 60 years in other studies. The training status varied across the studies, encompassing healthy individuals, sports students, moderately healthy individuals, and untrained participants. The specific exercise protocols were detailed, outlining the warm-up and cool-down durations, intensity progressions, and specific exercises for both the endurance and strength training components. The studies exhibited differences in their use of outcome measures. The endurance outcomes of the included studies are presented in Table 4 , which also provides details regarding the number of participants, their age, sex distribution, duration of the interventions and training status of the participants. 3.2. Maximal Oxygen Uptake As one of the most commonly used endurance performance parameters, the oxygen uptake was tested the most in the included studies, as it was measured in ten of the fifteen studies included in this review, either in the form of VO2max, or VO2peak. All the studies showed a significant increase from pre to post in both the ER and RE groups, except the RE group in the study by Ruiz-Alias et al. [ 33 ]. The ER group in that study showed a significant increase in VO2peak pre to post, while the RE group did not, but did not differ significantly from the RE. Two studies showed significant between-group effects on the oxygen uptake. One of those studies found a significant difference favoring ER over RE [ 28 ], while the other one favored RE over ER [ 25 ]. The study by Chtara et al. [ 28 ] also found a significant between-group effect for the velocity at maximal oxygen consumption (vVO2max), favoring ER over RE, with both groups showing a significant increase from pre- to post-test. 3.3. Other Endurance Measures One of the studies [ 28 ] tested the time trial performance and found a significant performance increase from pre to post in both the ER and RE groups. The magnitude of the change was larger in the ER group, which resulted in a significant between-group effect favoring ER over RE. In six of the studies, either the maximal aerobic power (MAP) or maximal power on incremental test (Wmax) was tested. All the studies showed significant improvement from pre to post for both the ER and RE groups. One study [ 32 ] found a significant between-group effect for the morning-ER group over the morning-RE group from pre to post. The mean increase in the evening-ER group was significantly larger than the evening-RE group from week 13–24, but not from pre to post. Four studies tested the time to exhaustion (TTE). All of these showed significant improvements from pre- to post- test. The study by Küüsmaa et al. [ 32 ] was the only one of these studies to show a significant between-group effect favoring ER over RE, both for the morning and the evening groups. Two studies tested the lactate threshold (LT) and second ventilatory threshold (VT2). Both showed a significant increase from pre to post for both the ER and RE groups, but no differences between the two groups. 4. Discussion The aim of this review is to examine the impact of the sequence of concurrent endurance and strength training, specifically comparing the effects of strength training followed by endurance training versus endurance training followed by strength training, on endurance performance. No significant differences between the ER and RE groups were found in any of the measured outcomes in 11 of the 15 studies. One study [ 25 ] favored RE over ER and showed a significant between-group effect for VO2max. However, this was the only study and measurement that favored RE over ER. On the other hand, three studies found significant between-group effects favoring ER over RE for the following outcomes: Wmax [ 32 ], TTE [ 31 ], and VO2max, vVO2max and TT performance [ 28 ]. One similarity between the studies that favored ER is that the endurance training was performed at high intensity, as described in Table 2 . Several explanations can be proposed for why these studies, with these characteristics, showed a larger sequence effect. It is plausible that a higher-intensity workout, compared to a lower-intensity one, is more challenging to complete, and therefore, fatigue buildup from an initial strength training session might negatively affect the high-intensity session to a larger degree. The strength training prior to the endurance session might have affected the performance in the endurance session negatively, which we have reason to assume it would, based on studies showing impaired endurance performance after strength exercise [ 21 , 40 ]. Therefore, it is important to consider the potential impact of initial fatigue from previous strength training on subsequent endurance sessions, especially those at maximal exertion. However, none of these studies specified the intensity the two groups (ER and RE) performed their workouts at. Thus, it cannot be inferred that this was the reason for the findings in this review, and further research is needed to explore whether the sequence of concurrent training might affect performance due to initial fatigue and to what extent this might influence endurance training outcomes. In contrast, the study by Banitalebi et al. [ 25 ], which favored RE, was conducted with low training intensities for both the endurance and strength sessions, and the sessions lasted only 16–30 min. A potential weakness with that study is that the ER and RE groups do not appear to be similar in terms of the VO2max at baseline, as shown in Table 1 , with ER performing better than RE. This difference in aerobic fitness between the groups might have made the initial gains from the endurance training easier to gain for the RE group, which started from a lower level. Another important aspect of this study is that investigating the effect of the ER vs. RE sequence on endurance performance was not the main goal of the study. Several included studies primarily focused on other measurements to address their research questions, which is potentially suboptimal for studying the sequence effect on endurance performance. Another area where the study favoring RE differs from those studying ER is the duration of the intervention. While the study favoring RE [ 25 ] lasted over eight weeks, the studies that favored ER lasted for 24 [ 31 , 34 ] and 12 weeks [ 28 ], respectively. The participants were also much younger in the studies favoring ER, as described in Table 3 . And for the study by Chtara et al. [ 28 ], the participants had a higher baseline VO2max, at 51 mL/kg/min for both the ER and RE groups, compared to 29.07 ± 1.88 (ER) and 24.60 ± 1.35 (RE) in the study by Banitalebi et al. [ 25 ]. The other two studies that favored ER did not measure the oxygen uptake, but from the description of the participants ( Table 3 ), it is reasonable to assume that they also had better baseline fitness. The reviewed studies often investigated other research questions than what sequence of concurrent training is best for improving endurance performance. So, more studies of better quality, and studies investigating the concurrent training sequence effect on performance as their main research question, are needed to gain more knowledge on this topic. The research questions often concerned health outcomes or other hormonal measurements, often among elderly, overweight, or untrained participants. In many of the studies, the strength outcomes were a lot more thoroughly tested, with more tests and measurements than performed for the endurance outcomes. One or more endurance measures were taken but were usually not the main focus area of the studies. The endurance measurement most commonly used by the included studies in this review was an oxygen uptake test, which is considered an important performance parameter and a measure of cardiorespiratory fitness [ 41 ]. It is considered a good predictor of performance in some endurance sports like uphill running races [ 42 ]; however, it might not be a good performance predictor in, for example, longer lasting events like mass-start bike races [ 43 ]. This review only found a small sequence effect between ER and RE, only for when the endurance training was performed at a high intensity, and otherwise no difference between the concurrent training sequences. Despite this, it is important to mention that for strength adaptations, the concurrent training sequence can play a more important role. Studies have shown that RE can have a significant favorable effect over ER on strength adaptations [ 12 , 44 , 45 ]. This can be due to hormonal responses such as reduced mTOR signaling due to AMPK induced by endurance training [ 46 ]. Hypertrophy gains typically take considerable time to develop, which can be even more challenging for endurance athletes experiencing the interference effect from their endurance training [ 10 , 11 ]. Knowing this, even endurance athletes could consider performing strength training prior to the endurance session if they must do both consecutively, if gaining muscle mass is of interest to the athlete. As previously mentioned, an increase in locomotive muscle mass has been thought to be a positive adaptation from strength training for endurance athletes [ 7 ]. Therefore, endurance athletes who are seeking to increase their muscle mass in the locomotive muscles in their main sport could consider performing strength training prior to endurance exercise. This might also be worth considering in training early in the preparation period and further from competitions when strength adaptation might be more of a priority. The sequence of concurrent training within the same session seems to have a negligible impact on endurance and a small effect on strength parameters. On the other hand, separating the sessions by at least 6 h has been shown to be beneficial for minimizing the acute interference effect, which can negatively affect such parameters as running economy [ 18 , 20 , 21 ]. Strength training, which induces muscle damage, can reduce performance and oxygen uptake even 48 h after exercise, depending on the degree of muscle damage caused by the strength training [ 40 ]. One can therefore argue for the importance of an adequate resting period after the strength training to perform the endurance session with optimal quality, particularly those of high intensity. A potential concern when studying untrained, older and/or overweight participants is that factors such as daily activities, a general warm up or self-transportation to and from the training location may affect the findings due to their similarity in duration and intensity to the intervention, and therefore, they might give similar responses to the intervention. Given the low training doses for both the strength and endurance interventions, it can be argued that a short general warm up before the strength training, which was performed in several of the studies, made it hard to investigate the sequence effect of ER and RE. For example, a walk from a bus stop or a parking lot, which might include some longer stairs and a long hallway toward the training facility, can suddenly mean that just getting to the location of the workout itself might look quite similar in terms of the intensity and duration as the intervention. In the study by Banitalebi et al. [ 25 ], the participants trained at 40% of 1 RM for the strength training, and for 16 min at 45% of VO2max for the endurance part, during the initial weeks of their intervention. This corresponds to an endurance intervention intensity of 13.1 and 11.7 mL/kg/min for ER and RE group, respectively, which is an intensity similar to a typical walking pace [ 47 , 48 ]. This makes it very likely that when studies investigate the sequence effect of strength and endurance training in untrained/overweight individuals, especially with as small training doses as used in some of the included studies, daily activity might give some similar responses as the intervention if the intervention is set at a low enough duration and intensity. This poses difficulties in examining any sequence effect, particularly when daily non-training activities are performed in close proximity to the training intervention. Too low a training intensity and volume might contribute to another problem when trying to investigate the sequence effect. According to the study by Coffey and Hawley [ 49 ], the adaptations resulting from single-mode training (e.g., strength or endurance alone) and concurrent training are largely comparable in the first days/weeks of training for an untrained individual. They further hypothesize that it could be because the body does not differentiate between strength and endurance-like adaptational signals, likely because strength and endurance training is conducted at quite a moderate volume and intensity. This might partially explain some of the findings of this review. For example, the lack of any sequence effect might be somewhat due to the fact that a lot of the studies were performed with a low-volume and low-intensity intervention and conducted on untrained participants. For the studies that found a sequence effect favoring ER, high-intensity endurance training was a common denominator of all three studies. Those studies were also among the studies that stretched over the longest duration, which is a possible benefit, especially if the participants are untrained. This review has some potential limitations. Firstly, the evidence provided is scarce, with only 15 studies meeting the eligibility criteria. In this review, 9 of the 15 included studies only used one endurance measurement, and they used various tests, so there were limited studies investigating the same outcome. The participants, duration of interventions and intervention protocols were also widely different across the studies, which makes it more difficult to make comparisons between them. Another limitation is that the effect sizes of the between-group effects could not be derived from all the studies, so data had to be presented as the change of the mean pre- to post-tests and level of significance of the between-group effect. Because of the substantial heterogeneity of the methods used across the studies, no statistical test for a meta-analysis could be conducted, and the findings were just interpretations of the results made by the authors. Furthermore, only one of the authors conducted the screening and PEDro assessment, which could introduce potential bias and limit the reliability of the selection and quality assessment process. The concurrent training sequence effect appears to be marginal, with small potential gains or losses to be made from choosing one sequence over the other. Since the participants in the studies included in this review were mainly untrained, they often experienced large improvements in the endurance parameters from pre to post. This might make it harder to observe a small sequence effect between the two groups. A preferable study design to investigate the sequence effect could have been one that was conducted on elite or professional athletes, where one would not expect to see a large increase in the pre to post values due to the prescribed training, and therefore, one might have been able to investigate the sequence effect of the concurrent training a bit more effectively. The main objective of this review was to examine the sequence effect of ER compared to the RE training sequence. In general, this review finds small and non-conclusive sequence effects between ER and RE, suggesting that the sequence of concurrent training is not of great importance in relation to endurance performance. The findings of this review, which primarily included untrained to moderately trained individuals, show largely small to no effect from one sequence over the other. However, the concurrent training sequence might be a relevant concern for both professional and amateur athletes when planning their training schedule. It is important to note that none of the studies in this review were conducted on elite or high-level athletes, and the training volume used for the interventions would have been very low for most athletes in most situations. This limitation makes it challenging to extract relevant data to provide recommendations for endurance athletes. Further research on this topic, particularly involving participants of higher fitness levels, is needed to better understand the impact of a concurrent training sequence for endurance athletes at a higher level. If, for practical reasons, both training modes must be performed with little to no rest between them, one could argue that it is advisable to prioritize the highest priority workout first, and preferably to perform strength training the same day as a low-intensity and low total-load endurance workout. This approach might help minimize the interference between the two modes of exercise. In cases where strength training must be performed close to a high-intensity endurance session, it may be preferable to perform the endurance session first, if endurance performance is a higher priority for the athlete than strength adaptations. One alternative can be to perform the strength and endurance sessions using mainly different muscle groups to minimize the interference. For example, cycling for the endurance part followed by upper-body strength training, or hand cycling followed by lower-body strength training. 5. Conclusions This review finds small and non-conclusive sequence effects between ER and RE, suggesting that the sequence of concurrent training is not of great importance in terms of endurance performance. This review also highlights the need for more and better research on the effect of concurrent training sequence on endurance performance. As of now, there is not enough evidence to draw any conclusions.

Sedentary young adults were randomly assigned to perform 3 bouts/day of vigorously ascending a 3-flight stairwell (60 steps), separated by 1–4 h of recovery, 3 days/week for 6 weeks, or a nontraining control group ( n = 12 each). Peak oxygen uptake was higher in the climbers after the intervention ( P = 0.003), suggesting that stair climbing “snacks” are effective in improving cardiorespiratory fitness, although the absolute increase was modest. Résumé Nous étudions l’effet des exercices courts et rapides de montée d’escaliers sur la consommation d’oxygène de pointe. De jeunes adultes sédentaires sont répartis de façon aléatoire dans un groupe expérimental pour effectuer trois séances/jour de montées vigoureuses dans une cage d’escalier à trois volées (60 marches), intercalées de 1–4 h de récupération, 3 jours/semaine pendant 6 semaines ou à un groupe de contrôle sans entraînement ( n = 12 chacun). La consommation d’oxygène de pointe est plus élevé chez les monteurs d’escalier après l’intervention ( P = 0,003), ce qui suggère que les montées brèves et rapides des escaliers sont efficaces pour améliorer la condition cardiorespiratoire, bien que l’augmentation absolue soit modeste. [Traduit par la Rédaction] Introduction Low cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) is associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular disease ( Kodama et al. 2009 ). Habitual physical activity increases CRF but many individuals do not perform sufficient amounts as recommended by public health agencies, often citing “lack of time” as a perceived barrier ( Colley et al. 2011 ). Sprint interval training (SIT), involving brief bouts of vigorous exercise interspersed with 2 min of recovery, increases CRF similar to traditional moderate-intensity continuous training despite reduced time commitment ( Gillen et al. 2016 ; Gist et al. 2014 ). Most SIT studies involve specialized equipment and protocols that are not easily transferable outside of a laboratory setting. Vigorous stair climbing is a practical and accessible form of SIT that can increase CRF in previously sedentary individuals when performed for several weeks ( Allison et al. 2017 ). Francois et al. (2014) coined the term “exercise snacks” to describe breaking up a single session of continuous exercise into several shorter bouts spread throughout the day. A training program involving three ∼12-min bouts of intermittent interval exercise was superior to a single daily bout of energy-matched continuous exercise for improving blood sugar control in people with insulin resistance ( Francois et al. 2014 ). It is unknown if SIT exercise snacks, or brief bouts of vigorous exercise performed as single sprints spread throughout the day, is a sufficient stimulus to improve CRF. The design of the present study was modelled after work by Allison et al. (2017) ; however, in contrast to the original protocol, the 3 bouts of stair climbing were separated by a few hours of recovery, as compared with being performed in a single session with a few minutes in between bouts. We hypothesized that, as compared with a nontraining control group, a protocol involving 3 daily bouts of vigorously ascending a 3-flight stairwell (60 steps), with 1–4 h recovery, would enhance CRF when performed 3 days/week for 6 weeks. Materials and methods Participants Twenty-four young adults were recruited primarily from the student population at McMaster University. Inclusion criteria were deemed healthy based on the Canadian Society for Exercise Physiology (CSEP) General Activity Questionnaire (GAQ) ( CSEP 2017 ) and inactive as determined by a self-report of less than 1 h of structured physical activity per week using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire ( Craig et al. 2003 ). Exclusion criteria were: diagnosed cardiometabolic disease, smoker, and answering “yes” to any of the questions on the GAQ form. Participants were assigned to either the stair-climbing intervention ( n = 12; male/female = 3/9, age = 20.0 ± 1.8 years; body mass index = 21.9 ± 5.0 kg/m 2 ; mean ± SD) or a nontraining control group ( n = 12; male/female = 2/10, age = 19.3 ± 1.6 years; body mass index = 23.8 ± 2.6 kg/m 2 ) using a block randomization scheme and block size of 2 to ensure an equal number of subjects in each group. Participants assigned to the control group were given the option to complete the exercise intervention following the main study. The protocol was approved by the McMaster Research Ethics Board, and all participants provided written informed consent after being advised of the experimental procedures and potential risks. Experimental protocol Participants initially reported to the laboratory for a determination of peak oxygen uptake ( V̇ O 2peak ) and peak power output ( W peak ) based on a ramp exercise protocol performed on a cycle ergometer (Excalibur Sport, version 2.0; Lode BV, Groningen, the Netherlands) and metabolic cart with an online gas collection system (Moxus; AEI Technologies, Pittsburgh, Pa., USA) as previously described ( Allison et al. 2017 ). Briefly, after a 3-min warm-up at 50 W, power output increased by 1 W every 2 s until the pedal cadence fell less than 60 rpm. Method error reproducibility for the V̇ O 2peak test (coefficient of variation) was 2% with an intraclass correlation coefficient of 98.6% when assessed using 2 baseline tests performed ∼1 week apart in 13 participants. The participants in the intervention group subsequently returned to the laboratory and practiced the stair climbing protocol by completing a single bout of the 3-flight stair case. Participants were also familiarized with wearing the heart rate monitor and using the rating of perceived exertion scale. Training was commenced ≥72 h after the familiarization session. Participants reported to the staircase 3 times per day, 3 days a week, for a total of 54 training sessions over 6 weeks. The stair climbing protocol was modeled after previous work in our laboratory ( Allison et al. 2017 ) that involved 3×20-s “all-out” sprints interspersed with 2 min of recovery, such that 58 ± 4 stairs were climbed per bout and a total of 180 ± 11 stairs per session. For the present study, each “exercise snack” involved a continuous ascent of a 3-flight (60-step) stair case. Each session was supervised by a member of our research group, and subjects were instructed to “safely ascend the stairs, 1 step at a time, as quickly as possible using the railings as deemed necessary for support.” Three bouts were performed each day, separated by a minimum of 1 h and maximum of 4 h. Each bout was preceded by a dynamic warm-up consisting of 10 jumping-jacks, 10 air squats, and 5 lunges on each side, and followed by a cool-down consisting of 1 min of level walking. Participants reported their rating of perceived exertion (RPE) using the Borg category ratio scale (0–10) immediately before and after each bout and heart rate was measured periodically during training sessions to monitor relative effort and training intensity. Post-training measurements of V̇ O 2peak and W peak were performed ∼72 h after the last training session. Subjects in the control group returned for an additional round of testing 6 weeks after their baseline tests ( Fig. 1 ). Fig. 1. Fig. 1 . Study design. Vertical bar represents 1 ascent up a 3-flight stairwell (60 steps). Dashed arrow represent warm-up, solid arrow represent cool-down. V̇ O 2peak , peak oxygen uptake. Statistical analysis V̇ O 2peak and W peak data were analyzed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with the pretest utilized as a covariate in the model ( Rausch et al. 2003 ). Statistical significance was set as P ≤ 0.05. Cohen’s d was used to determine effect size for the change from pre- to post-training in the intervention group. Data are presented as means ± SD ( n = 12 for each group, except n = 11 for V̇ O 2peak for control group owing to removal of 1 subject identified as a statistical outlier, >2 SD below mean). Training characteristics (RPE, heart rate (HR), time to ascend) were analyzed using a 1-way ANOVA. Results At baseline, V̇ O 2peak in both groups was similar (1834 ± 363 vs. 1844 ± 467 mL/min). ANCOVA revealed a significant ( P = 0.002) difference between groups after the intervention, such that V̇ O 2peak was higher in the training group compared with control, 1918 ± 326 and 1740 ± 453 (mL/min), respectively ( Fig. 2A ), and the corresponding effect size was d = 0.46. However, the absolute increase in V̇ O 2peak in the training group compared with baseline was modest (∼5% increase, 95% confidence interval (CI): 15, 164 mL/min). Baseline W peak was also similar between groups at baseline (161 ± 33 vs. 163 ± 34 W). W peak was also higher ( P < 0.001) in the training group compared with control after the intervention, 178 ± 32 and 154 ± 33 (W), respectively ( Fig. 2B ), and the corresponding effect size was d = 0.74. The absolute increase in W peak in the training group compared with baseline was 12% (95% CI: 6, 34 W). With respect to characteristics during training, mean RPE was similar throughout training and corresponded to 5 ± 1 or a value of “hard”. Mean HR was also relatively consistent during training (169 ± 12 and 174 ± 14 bpm, respectively, during weeks 1 and 6, P = 0.50) and corresponded to ∼85% of age-predicted maximum. Mean time to ascend 60 steps generally decreased across the training period, with a significant decrease in time of ascent from week 1 to week 6, 22 ± 3 and 20 ± 2 s, respectively ( P = 0.001). The 12 participants in the training intervention completed all scheduled training sessions. Fig. 2. Fig. 2 . Absolute peak oxygen uptake ( V̇ O 2peak ) (A) and peak power output (B) measured before (Pre) and after (Post) 6 weeks of stair climbing sessions or an equivalent period without a prescribed exercise intervention. Values are means ± SD. *, P < 0.05 between groups. Discussion This was the first study to investigate the effect of brief bouts of stair climbing exercise spread throughout the day on CRF. Performing 6 weeks of sprint exercise snacks with 1–4 h rest in between bouts resulted in a higher V̇ O 2peak when compared with a nonexercise control group. We also found that W peak was higher in the training group compared with control, suggesting a beneficial effect of the stair climbing protocol on this measure of functional capacity. The stair climbing protocol in the present study was modelled after previous work in our laboratory ( Allison et al. 2017 ), with the key difference being the duration of recovery between exercise bouts. The improvement in V̇ O 2peak in the present study (∼5%) was relatively smaller than observed in our previous study ( Allison et al. 2017 ), in which bouts of intermittent stair climbing were performed with a few minutes of recovery periods (∼12%). We attribute this smaller relative improvement in V̇ O 2peak to the longer period of recovery between stair climbing bouts, i.e., 1–4 h (mean 2.4 ± 1.3 h) in the present study as compared with 2 min in our previous study ( Allison et al. 2017 ). In support of this interpretation, mean RPE remained consistent across bouts of exercise in the present study, whereas in the work of Allison et al. (2017) , RPE climbed over the course of the successive bouts, suggesting a greater relative stress when recovery periods are short and the stair climbing bouts are performed as a single training session. Despite eliciting relatively smaller improvements in V̇ O 2peak as compared with our previous study that used brief recovery periods ( Allison et al. 2017 ), the improvements in W peak were similar, suggesting less of an effect of recovery duration on the determinants of this measures. It is possible that the intense stair climbing efforts provided a greater stimulus for peripheral (i.e., skeletal muscle) adaptations, which contributing to the improved W peak . It is also possible that the nature of the warm-up exercise, while brief, may have contributed to a leg-strengthening effect. The improvements in cycling W peak occurred despite the training being performed as stair climbing, suggesting that overall exercise tolerance and capacity was improved. Some limitations are to be addressed in our study: first, we did not employ a blinded randomization procedure, and a randomization concealment tool would have eliminated any potential bias introduced during this process. Another potential limitation is that while subjects were instructed to maintain their habitual living patterns it is possible that changes in behaviour (e.g., physical activity) could have influenced the measurement of V̇ O 2peak . In conclusion, the stair climbing exercise snacking protocol tested in this study resulted in a 5% increase in CRF and 12% increase in cycling peak power output in healthy, sedentary adults, which was significantly higher when compared with a nontraining control group. The absolute increase in CRF was modest, however, and relatively smaller than we previously observed when a similar stair-climbing intervention was performed as a single session with a few minutes of recovery between bouts, as compared with the 1–4 h of recovery between bouts in the present study. We speculate that the longer recovery periods may reduce the overall metabolic stress as compared with traditional sprint interval training protocols and potentially attenuate the adaptive response in CRF. The present work nonetheless shows that the stair climbing exercise snacking protocol was feasible, and well-tolerated by sedentary individuals, and improved functional performance. Future research should investigate different exercise snacking protocols with varying recovery time to determine whether the increased time between snacks attenuates the metabolic stress characteristic of SIT and changes in CRF. Additionally, future research should examine the effect on other-health related indices such as blood pressure and glycemic control.

If so, the implications could ripple through the multi-billion dollar fitness and food industries and have implications for both consumers and health-care providers. Three studies—two field experiments and one observational field study—triangulate on this potential compensatory mechanism between physical activity and food intake. The findings showed that when physical activity was perceived as fun (e.g., when it is labeled as a scenic walk rather than an exercise walk), people subsequently consume less dessert at mealtime and consume fewer hedonic snacks. A final observational field study during a competitive race showed that the more fun people rated the race as being, the less likely they were to compensate with a hedonic snack afterwards. Engaging in a physical activity seems to trigger the search for reward when individuals perceive it as exercise but not when they perceive it as fun. Key implications for the fitness industry and for health-care professionals are detailed along with the simple advice to consumers to make certain they make their physical activity routine fun in order to avoid compensation.

When people begin exercise programs, they do not necessarily lose weight (Church et al. 2007 ). One reason may be because individuals reward themselves through compensation for physical excursion expended (King 1999 ; King et al. 1996 ; Martins et al. 2007 ) and overestimate calories burned relative to the calories consumed (Lichtman et al. 1992 ; Wansink and Chandon 2006 ). To understand how to attenuate this compensation, we examined how changing perceptions of physical activity through framing can impact subsequent food consumption. The existence of such a potential compensation between two key recommendations for obesity prevention raises the question of how to correct it. Building on the delay of gratification theory (Mischel et al. 1989 ), we suggest that framing exercise as fun reduces individuals’ tendency to indulge because it diverts their attention away from the effort required by the physical activity. Focusing attention on something else may change the perceptions of the effort expend during the activity, reducing feelings of entitlement due to exercising (Kivetz and Zheng 2006 ). Our studies examine whether framing physical activity as fun can alter these compensation effects. This suggests a boundary condition of licensing effects: reducing the perceived effort (but not the real effort) in an exertion activity may change its effect on subsequent actions. We also examine if licensing effects of physical activity are selectively directed towards hedonic foods and not towards all kind of foods. This may suggest that weight gain due to compensation for physical activity is at least partly attributable to excessive consumption of hedonic foods that are often more caloric than utilitarian foods. We begin with a brief review of relevant prior work on licensing effects and on the effects of distraction on delay of gratification. This leads to the prediction that labeling exercise as fun decreases subsequent compensation through food consumption. We present three studies that test this proposition in different settings and discuss theoretical and practical implications of this research. 1 Theoretical framework Individuals tend to compensate previous efforts through hedonic consumption. For example, when exposed to a loyalty program requiring greater effort, individuals prefer a luxury reward in comparison to more utilitarian choices than when the program requires less effort (Kivetz and Simonson 2002 ). Similarly, donations to charity are preferred to a monetary incentive when they are bundled with a hedonic product such as a hot fudge sundae than when they are bundled with a utilitarian item (Strahilevitz and Myers 1998 ). Preference for luxuries, relative to utilities, is also enhanced by previous acts enhancing self-concept, such as donations to charity (Khan and Dhar 2006 ). Previous research on compensation between exercising and food consumption suggests that physical activity can have a similar licensing effect allowing individuals to increase subsequent energy intake (e.g., Martins et al. 2007 ). Indeed, mental effort (Chaput et al. 2008 ) and even imagined exercising may lead to increases in food consumption (Werle et al. 2011 ). In the same vein, exposure to messages promoting exercise also leads to increased food intake (Albarracin et al. 2009 ). Research on justification effects demonstrates that prior decisions can serve as a license to choose indulgent options. It has been well documented that individuals tend to compensate previous efforts with hedonic choices (Kivetz and Simonson 2002 ; Kivetz and Zheng 2006 ; Mukhopadhyay and Johar 2009 ). When applied to the relationship between physical activity and food consumption, these findings suggest that compensation after exercising should be directed mainly towards hedonic foods (foods that are consumed mainly for pleasure or enjoyment motives) in comparison to utilitarian foods (consumed for practical or necessity motives). If there is compensation between physical activity and food consumption, it is important to examine how to prevent it. Previous research demonstrated that altering perceptions of physical activity has positive perceptual and behavioral effects (Crum and Langer 2007 ). In an experiment with hotel room attendants, half of participants were told that cleaning rooms was considered as good exercise characterizing an active lifestyle, while half of them did not receive this information. Four weeks after the intervention, participants in the treatment condition perceived themselves to be getting significantly more exercise than before and had significant changes in health indicators, such as decreased body weight and blood pressure. These results suggest that simply changing the perception of an activity may have significant behavioral effects, but they only documented changes in participants’ perception and in physical indicators (such as body weight, for example) with no direct behavioral measure. What has been largely unexplored is how changing the perception of a physical activity through framing may influence behavior and, specifically, food consumption. Being distracted during an initial activity can alter perceptions of how it is experienced (Fillingim et al. 1989 ; Karageorghis and Terry 1997 ; Lerouge 2009 ; Nowlis and Shiv 2005 ; Shiv and Nowlis 2004 ). Previous research on delay of gratification among children shows that fun distractions enhance children’s capacity to wait for a reward (Mischel et al. 1972 ). Distracting “fun” thoughts and self-generated activities helped to reduce child’s frustration during the waiting period and increased delay time. When applied to exercise, activities such as listening to music can result in better tolerance to increased levels of training (Karageorghis and Terry 1997 ). According to the activity engagement theory (Higgins and Trope 1990 ), focusing on how enjoyable or fun an activity is may increase intrinsic motivation and positive affect increasing the drive for the activity. However, little is known about whether framing a physical activity as fun may impact subsequent food consumption. We propose that labeling an activity as fun may reduce the likelihood to compensate with food as a reward (Khan and Dhar 2006 ). To understand how perceptions of physical activity influence food consumption, we conducted three studies. Studies 1 and 2 manipulated activity framing: participants performed a physical activity that was described either as fun or as exercise, and after which, food consumption was measured. In the first study, participants were allowed to freely consume hedonic and utilitarian foods in a buffet, and in the second, they served themselves a hedonic snack. Study 3 was a field observation study conducted during a race where participants were asked to rate how much fun they had while running and were offered the choice between two snacks (hedonic vs. utilitarian). 1.1 Study 1: labeling exercise as fun reduces the consumption of hedonic sides in a meal Study 1 examined the effect of physical activity framing on the overall food consumption during a meal and, specifically, on the side options offered to participants. We predicted that participants would consume a greater amount of hedonic side options when their walking session is framed as exercise in comparison to when it is framed as fun. Participants Fifty-six (56) female administrative staff members of a major Northeastern university (average age\u2009=\u200944.52\xa0years old) were recruited to participated in this study. Twenty-five participants (44.6\xa0%) had a normal body mass index (BMI). The study was conducted outdoors on the campus of a northeastern university (first phase) and in a university room that reproduces a real home kitchen and provides a natural environment for food consumption (second phase). Following IRB recommendations, participants were informed during recruitment that they would be engaging in an activity during the experience and should therefore wear comfortable shoes. The invitation also mentioned a free lunch after the experience. Procedure At the beginning of the session, participants signed a consent form and were randomly assigned to a framing condition (exercise vs. fun). Those in the exercise condition were told that the purpose of the 30-min experience was to exercise (i.e., walking). They received a card with a map of a 1-mile walking route inside the university campus that they were to follow during the study. Six points of the route were highlighted on the map. At each, they were instructed to indicate their energy level. In the fun condition, participants were told that the purpose of the 30-min walking experience was to do something fun. They were given the same 1-mile route as the exercise group, but instead were told that the purpose of the study was to listen to music through a MP3 player and to evaluate the clarity of the music at six different stopping points. They received a few instructions about how to operate the MP3 player, which contained the same selection of songs. Participants in both conditions were instructed to carry out the experience individually and were informed that after the activity, a lunch would be served. After participants arrived from their walk, they received a short questionnaire to evaluate the activity and were told that lunch would be served soon. As a manipulation check, participants indicated their level of agreement with the sentence, “I found this activity exciting” on a 9-point Likert scale (1\u2009=\u2009not at all; 9\u2009=\u2009extremely). They were then asked to report their perception of the distance walked in miles and the number of calories they think they had burned during the activity. In order to examine the possible role of a goal progress mechanism (Fishbach and Dhar 2005 ), participants were also asked to indicate how effective they thought the activity was in making progress towards the goal of staying fit (1\u2009=\u2009not at all; 9\u2009=\u2009extremely). Goal framework theories could argue that focusing on having fun or on exercising while performing a physical activity may actually impact the individuals’ perception of progress towards high priority goals (i.e., staying fit or healthy; Fishbach and Dhar 2005 ). More specifically, the fact that participants in the exercise condition focused on the effort could have influenced their inferences in terms of goal progress and induced search for compensation. Next, participants were individually invited to an all-you-can-eat buffet where they received instructions to serve themselves as much or as little as they wanted from different foods: pasta with meat, green beans, and bread. After that, they had the option to choose between two desserts—applesauce (utilitarian option) or chocolate pudding (hedonic option). They could take as much or as little dessert as they wanted, but they could only have one kind. We then took their trays and asked each participant to go to the corner of the room to choose a beverage, either regular Coke (hedonic option) or a bottle of water (utilitarian option). While they were choosing their drinks, we unobtrusively weighed their plates of pasta, green beans, bread, and dessert (separate plates for each). Participants received their trays back and were placed in an individual table to have lunch. During the meal, a TV show was presented on the lab television to discourage social interaction between participants. When participants finished their lunch, they answered a short questionnaire regarding their lunch experience. Then, they were thanked, debriefed individually, and allowed to exit. The entire experiment took 50–60\xa0min. After participants left the room, research assistants weighed leftovers to estimate the actual amount of food consumed. Note that all measures were voluntary and therefore subject to participants’ willingness to answer. Thus, some questions were left unanswered (as documented by the varying degrees of freedom in the analyses below). Manipulation check and controls As expected, participants in the fun condition found the activity more exciting ( M =\u20097.19) than those in the exercise condition, ( M =\u20096.45; F (1, 54)\u2009=\u20092.83, p =\u2009.04, one-tailed). The framing manipulation did not affect perceptions of the distance walked ( F (1, 55)\u2009=\u2009.182; p =\u2009.671) nor did the perceived amount of calories burned during the activity ( F (1, 52)\u2009=\u20091.019, p =\u2009.32), suggesting that our effect is not attributable to different perceptions of physical effort across conditions (Kivetz and Simonson 2002 ). Results indicate no significant difference in perceptions of goal progress across conditions ( F (1, 52)\u2009=\u20092.05, p >\u2009.20), suggesting that the observed results cannot be explained by goal progress inferences (Fishbach and Dhar 2005 ). Results An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to test the effect of framing (exercise vs. fun frame) on food consumption. Our dependent variables were the amount of food served and consumed by participants during the meal. We converted the weight measures of all the elements in the menu (green beans, pasta, bread, dessert, and drinks) into calories using the information available on the food manufacturers’ websites. In the analyses, we initially entered participants’ age, BMI, and level of hunger as potential covariates, but there were no effects and these variables are no longer discussed. Interestingly, there were no statistical differences across conditions in the total amount of main course calories served ( M fun =\u2009305.75, M exercise =\u2009313.23, F (1, 55)\u2009=\u2009.180; p =\u2009.67) and consumed ( M fun =\u2009258.07, M exercise =\u2009271.87, F (1, 55)\u2009=\u2009.392; p =\u2009.53). In contrast, the analysis of dessert and drink calories chosen indicates that participants in the fun condition served themselves fewer calories ( M fun =\u200994.45) than participants in the exercise condition ( M exercise =\u2009133.98, F (1, 50)\u2009=\u20092.791, p <\u2009.05, one-tailed; see Table 1 ). These results indicate that compensation for physical effort was directed towards hedonic choices—in this case, chocolate pudding and regular soft drink—rather increasing aggregate calories. Table 1 Calories served in the meal and in hedonic side choices (study 1) Full size table It is noteworthy that there was no difference in the number of participants choosing hedonic sides across conditions: 50\xa0% of participants chose hedonic sides (either chocolate pudding as a dessert or a regular soft drink) in each condition ( χ 2 (1, N =\u200932)\u2009=\u2009.000; p =\u2009.60). The difference in the number of calories across conditions is due to the amount of hedonic dessert served: participants in the exercise condition who chose chocolate pudding as a dessert served themselves more than participants in the fun condition who made the same choice ( M fun =\u2009100.10, M exercise =\u2009135.30, F (1, 19)\u2009=\u20095.011, p <\u2009.05, one-tailed). Similarly, participants in the exercise condition consumed more chocolate pudding than those in the fun condition ( M fun =\u200992.72, M exercise =\u2009118.30, F (1, 19)\u2009=\u20094.763, p <\u2009.05, one-tailed). Next, an ANOVA tested the effect of framing on fatigue and on mood. Consistent with our hypothesis, the exercise condition resulted in participants reporting more fatigue after completing the walking experience than those in the fun condition ( M fun =\u20093.48, M exercise =\u20094.79, F (1, 53)\u2009=\u20097.698, p <\u2009.05). Additionally, individuals in the fun condition reported a more positive mood after completing the walking experience than those in the exercise condition ( M fun =\u20097.91, M exercise =\u20097.19, F (1, 53)\u2009=\u20097.698, p <\u2009.01). These results suggest that focusing on having fun reduces perceptions of exertion associated with physical activity and increases positive mood. Mediation analysis Next, we examined whether the effect of the framing manipulation on the number of calories of hedonic sides served was mediated by perceptions of fatigue or positive mood. A bootstrapping method (based on 1,000 bootstrap samples) was performed to examine indirect effects (Zhao et al. 2010 ) for each potential mediator. This analysis revealed that positive mood mediates the effect of the framing manipulation on the amount of calories of hedonic sides served: the mean indirect effect from the bootstrap analysis is negative and significant ( β =\u2009−12.79), with a 95\xa0% confidence interval excluding zero (−32.829 to −2.127). The same analysis conducted for fatigue showed that this variable did not mediate the effects of framing on the number of calories of hedonic sides served (95\xa0% CI\u2009=\u2009−28.650 to 11.908). Discussion Study 1 demonstrated that labeling a physical activity as fun can have positive consequences in terms of subsequent food decisions. Our results showed that when participants focused on exercising while walking, they felt more exertion (fatigue), they were in a less positive mood, and they consumed more of the hedonic sides offered during the meal. However, it is noteworthy that this overconsumption is not indiscriminate: there were no differences in the total number of calories consumed during the meal across conditions. The compensation in the exercise frame condition was directed towards hedonic side options only. Additional results showed that perceptions of effort, fatigue, or goal progress towards the objective of staying fit played no role in our findings. Furthermore, our results showed that the mechanism explaining these effects is the positive mood induced by the fun framing of the physical activity. Previous research in licensing effects demonstrated that more effortful activities lead to more hedonic choices (Kivetz and Simonson 2002 ; Khan and Dhar 2006 ). We contribute to this literature by showing that when an effortful activity is perceived as exercise, it leads to increased consumption of hedonic foods (but not of utilitarian foods) in comparison to when the same activity is perceived as fun. These results suggest that framing a physical activity as fun may be a way to diminish licensing effects. 1.2 Study 2: labeling exercise as fun diminishes the amount of hedonic snacks served Study 1 provided preliminary evidence for the effect of physical activity framing on food consumption. However, our manipulation did not rule out any differential effects the mere presence of music in fun (vs. no music in the exercise) had on consumption. Specifically, it could be that the music in the fun condition was distracting, which could have increased positive mood independently of our fun framing. Therefore, although the manipulation check worked, it is not clear if our effects could be attributed to the presence versus absence of music or to the fun versus exercise framing manipulation. Study 2 addressed this issue by using a more ecologically valid manipulation of framing: participants performed the same walk as in study 1 but only the description of the walk changed across conditions. In the fun condition, the walk was described as a campus visit and participants were instructed to sightseeing while in the exercise condition, the walk was described as exercise. Furthermore, we also looked into a different dependent variable: the amount of hedonic snacks served. We predicted that participants would be more likely to serve themselves a greater amount of snacks when the physical activity was labeled as exercised than when it was labeled as fun. Participants Forty-six administrative staff members of a major Northeastern university (87\xa0% women, average age\u2009=\u200944.35\xa0years old) participated in this study. Thirty-two of them (69.6\xa0%) had a normal BMI. The study was conducted outdoors on the campus of the university. Participants were informed during recruitment that they would be engaging in an activity during the experience and should therefore wear comfortable shoes. Procedure After reading and signing the consent form, participants were randomly assigned to one of the two conditions. Participants in the exercise condition received the same instructions as those in study 1 (i.e., walking through a 1-mile route to exercise). In the fun condition, participants followed the same walking route, but in this condition, the activity was described as sightseeing. After reading and signing the consent form, participants were told that the purpose of the 30-min experience was to do something fun: visiting the campus and sightseeing. Participants were given the same card as those in the exercise condition, but instead of rating their energy levels, they were told to observe and evaluate each of the six different points of the sightseeing route. In both conditions, participants followed the same walking route and were instructed to carry out the experience individually. When participants finished their walk, as a thank-you for their participation, we offered them a sweet snack (M&M’s), which was to be poured into Ziploc bags. The M&M’s were presented in 1\xa0gal-size serving bowls. All participants used the same size quarter-cup scoop to dish out the M&M’s. After pouring as much or as little as they wanted, a research assistant unobtrusively weighed the bags while participants answered a final set of questions. Then participants were debriefed individually and thanked. Results A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) tested the effect of framing (fun vs. exercise) on the number of calories in the amount of M&M’s selected by participants. Again, we converted the weight measures of the M&M’s into calories using the manufacturer’s information. BMI, gender, and age were included in the analysis but had no effect and are no longer discussed. As suggested, there was a significant main effect of the manipulated factor on the amount of M&M’s served, so that participants in the exercise condition took more M&Ms ( M exercise =\u2009372.3 cal) than those in the fun sightseeing condition ( M fun =\u2009166.2 cal; F (1, 45)\u2009=\u20095.06, p <\u2009.05). Discussion In line with our theorizing and with the results of study 1, focusing on having fun while performing a physical activity reduced the amount of hedonic snack served. Participants in the exercise condition served themselves more hedonic snacks (M&M’s) than participants in the fun condition. 1.3 Study 3: having fun during a race increases the choice of a healthy snack In this observational field study, we hypothesized that runners who perceived themselves as having fun during a race would be less likely to compensate from their physical exertion by choosing to eat a hedonic, less healthy snack after the race. Consistent with the first two studies, we predicted that if they had fun, they would not feel the need to reward themselves through food consumption. Procedure This study was conducted during a real race: ekiden race, which is a marathon, ran in a relay of six runners completing distances of 5, 10, or 7.195\xa0km. We collected data at the finish aid station interviewing runners who finished their part of the race. When participants were leaving the station, they were invited to fill in a paper and pencil survey about their perception of the race. At the beginning of the questionnaire, the participants were told that to thank them for their participation, they would receive a snack and they could choose between a chocolate bar (relatively unhealthy food choice) and a cereal bar (relatively healthy food choice). They then answered a set of questions about their perception of the race (e.g., to what extent they had fun while running) and their individual characteristics (age, gender, height, weight). When participants handed in the filled questionnaire, the research assistant checked their choice and gave them the corresponding snack. The bars were put in envelopes to avoid having the brand influence the choice of the participants. Participants Two hundred and thirty-one runners aged between 16 and 67\xa0years old ( M =\u200935.64; 65.1\xa0% male) accepted to participate in this study. One hundred and eighty-two of them (79\xa0%) had a normal BMI. One hundred and eighteen participants ran 5\xa0km (50.4\xa0%), 85 participants ran 10\xa0km (36.6\xa0%), and 29 ran 7.195\xa0km (12.5\xa0%). Results Binomial logistic regression was used to test our predictions. The key dependent variable was snack choice, coded as one if a participant selected the relatively unhealthy snack choice (chocolate bar) and zero if a participant selected the relatively healthy snack choice (cereal bar). The extent to which participants had fun during the race was entered in the analysis as a continuous predictor variable. BMI and level of hunger were included as continuous predictor variables in the analysis, but their effect was not significant and these variables are no longer discussed. We also controlled for any effect of length of race (5\xa0k, 7.2\xa0k, or 10\xa0k), but we found no effect. The main effect of having fun on snack choice was significant ( B =\u2009−.204, χ 2 (1)\u2009=\u20093.694, p =\u2009.05): participants who had more fun during the race were more inclined to choose the cereal bar than participants who had less fun. Discussion Long-distance runners have a variety of ways they can frame their experience in a race. If competitive, they can view their race as a serious effort to win a medal or achieve a personal best time. Alternatively, some other runners could view the race as a form of a workout or exercise, but still others could see it as a form of adventure or as a “fun run.” How they view their 30–60\xa0min experience relates to what they chose to eat following the race. This is consistent with the findings of studies 1 and 2 and consistent with the rationale they offered. 2 General discussion Although it has been established that previous efforts may lead to compensation (e.g., Kivetz and Simonson 2002 ), there has been limited evidence on how to prevent this compensation. The present research specifically focused on the relationship between physical activity and food consumption, two key recommendations to prevent obesity. Specifically, we looked into how framing physical activity as something fun may prevent compensation through food consumption. Across three studies, in both lab and field settings, we found that framing a physical activity as fun (vs. exercise) influenced participants subsequent behavior. Specifically, we found that labeling a physical activity as fun reduced the amount of calories consumed in side dishes during a meal (study 1), the amount of hedonic food served (study 2), and perception of fun during a race positively influenced the choice of a healthy snack (study 3). In line with previous research (Martin et al. 2007 ), these effects were consistent after controlling for BMI. This is, to our knowledge, the first demonstration of how framing a physical activity may differentially influence actual food consumption. Importantly, the findings of the field study (study 1) and the observational study (study 3) replicated previous work on licensing effects (e.g., Khan and Dhar 2006 ) showing that compensation for physical activity is primarily directed towards hedonic rather than utilitarian food products. In study 1, the effects of physical activity framing on the amount of calories in the hedonic sides served were mediated by positive mood, suggesting a hedonic mechanism behind these effects. It seems that participants were having enough fun during the walk to prevent them from compensating through extra hedonic food consumption. These results are in line with the activity engagement theory (Higgins and Trope 1990 ; Higgins et al. 1995 ), which suggests that there is no need to compensate for fun intrinsically motivating activities in comparison to work activities that are more extrinsically motivating and therefore highly associated with extrinsic rewards. Future research should test other potential mechanisms behind the main effect documented here. For example, recent research (Laran and Janiszewski 2011 ) based on self-determination theory suggests that perceived vitality (Ryan and Deci 2008 ) could mediate the relationship between effort and food consumption. According to this research, because fun exercising is closely related to internal motivation, it should also enhance perceived vitality (i.e., people will feel more energized) and therefore reduce compensation through food consumption. This is an important area for future research. Knowing that framing a physical activity as something fun reduces compensation through food consumption is important from a public policy standpoint. The implications of the effect of exercise framing on consumption not only resonate with, but also present a solution to, current public policy and health issues on weight and obesity. Specifically, strategic interventions drawn from our work that highlight the fun of physical activity can be designed with the knowledge that past research using behavioral manipulations and measuring food consumption had demonstrated promising results. Furthermore, the fact that our studies were based on real physical activities and actual consumption behaviors, rather than imagined scenarios and measuring preferences and attitudes regarding hedonic relative to utilitarian food, shows the ecological validity of our findings. These results have significant relevance for the multi-billion dollar fitness and snack food industries. The profitability of fitness centers and gyms is not only related to how many members join but also to how long they stay involved and pay their monthly membership fees. Insofar as personal progress is likely to encourage one to maintain their membership, the fitness center or gym that warns or otherwise educates members to not compensate after their workout by overeating is likely enhancing the success of their members as well as their own revenue. Analogously, manufacturers of fitness equipment—treadmills, elliptical machines, and so on—should be similarly motivated to warn and encourage people not to compensate their new workout routines by overindulging with food as an after workout reward. Although the sales price of their machine may be a sunk cost, the more success and satisfaction people have with using it—and losing weight, if that is a goal—the better the word-of-mouth recommendations, loyalty, and future purchase potential will be. Health-care practitioners that provide advice related to physical activity and weight—including physicians, dieticians, nurses, and so on—could be well advised to warn their patients and clients about the danger of energy compensation. This is especially important given that many recommendations involve both the encouragement to exercise more and to eat less. Without informing consumers that their initial tendency might be to exercise more and to also eat more, they could be setting these individuals up for disappointment or discouragement. Lastly, consumers who are contemplating beginning a physical activity routine in order to help lose weight would be well advised to make certain they reframe it so they see it as fun—or at least not as work or exercise. Listening to music during a run, making phone calls during a walk, or watching a video during a treadmill routine may be more related to weight loss success and to perseverance than previously thought.

The present study aimed to examine the effect of a 15-week exercise training program on overall dietary patterns among young adults. Subjects/Methods This study consisted of 2680 young adults drawn from the Training Intervention and Genetics of Exercise Response (TIGER) study. Subjects underwent 15 weeks of aerobic exercise training, and exercise duration, intensity, and dose were recorded for each session using computerized heart rate monitors. In total, 4355 dietary observations with 102 food items were collected using a self-administered food frequency questionnaire before and after exercise training ( n =\u20092476 at baseline; n =\u20091859 at 15 weeks). Dietary patterns were identified using a Bayesian sparse latent factor model. Changes in dietary pattern preferences were evaluated based on the pre/post-training differences in dietary pattern scores, accounting for the effects of gender, race/ethnicity, and BMI. Results Within each of the seven dietary patterns identified, most dietary pattern scores were decreased following exercise training, consistent with increased voluntary regulation of food intake. A longer duration of exercise was associated with decreased preferences for the western ( β : −0.0793; 95% credible interval: −0.1568, −0.0017) and snacking ( β : −0.1280; 95% credible interval: −0.1877, −0.0637) patterns, while a higher intensity of exercise was linked to an increased preference for the prudent pattern ( β : 0.0623; 95% credible interval: 0.0159, 0.1111). Consequently, a higher dose of exercise was related to a decreased preference for the snacking pattern ( β : −0.0023; 95% credible interval: −0.0042, −0.0004) and an increased preference for the prudent pattern ( β : 0.0029; 95% credible interval: 0.0009, 0.0048). Conclusions The 15-week exercise training appeared to motivate young adults to pursue healthier dietary preferences and to regulate their food intake.

Copy URL Share a link Share on Email Facebook x LinkedIn Reddit Wechat Abstract High intensity interval training (HIIT) has been shown to consistently elicit rapid and significant adaptations in a number of physiological systems, across many different healthy and clinical populations. In addition, there is increasing interest in how some acute, yet transient responses to high intensity exercise potentially reduce the risks of particular diseases. Recent work has shown that discrete, brief bouts of high intensity exercise (termed ‘exercise snacks’) can improve glucose control and vascular health and thus counter the negative cardiometabolic consequences of prolonged, uninterrupted periods of inactivity. In this brief review, we advance the case, using evidence available from pre-clinical studies in the exercise oncology literature, that brief, frequently completed bouts of high intensity exercise embedded within an individual's overall daily and weekly physical activity schedule, may transiently impact the tumour microenvironment and improve the health outcomes for those who have been diagnosed and treated for cancer. Background Evidence showing the potency of high intensity interval training (HIIT) to elicit rapid and significant improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness and skeletal muscle oxidative capacity in healthy and athletic populations has led, over the past 15–20\xa0years, to research examining its safety, feasibility and efficacy in clinical populations (Gibala, 2021 ; Gibala, et\xa0al., 2012 ; Little et\xa0al., 2011 ). An increasing number of studies show that HIIT improves a range of health markers (e.g. cardiometabolic fitness, increased skeletal muscle mass and reduced body fat) in patients with diabetes, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, advanced cardiovascular disease and heart failure, and in pre-surgery patients, as well as in those who have been diagnosed and treated for breast, colon and prostate cancer (Cassidy et\xa0al., 2017 ; Devin et\xa0al., 2016 ; Hallsworth et\xa0al., 2015 ; Hollekim-Strand et\xa0al., 2014 ; Papadopoulos et\xa0al., 2021 ; Weston et\xa0al., 2016 ; Wisløff et\xa0al., 2007 ). There is also growing evidence that high intensity exercise can elicit transient changes in blood that may reduce the risks of developing cardiovascular disease (Little et\xa0al., 2014 ). The acute influence of ‘exercise snacks’ on markers of cardiometabolic health Compelling epidemiological data show that prolonged periods of inactivity increase the risk of cardiometabolic diseases (Dunstan et\xa0al., 2021 ). Mechanistically, activity- and inactivity-mediated changes in glucose control and vascular function have attracted the particular attention of researchers (Islam et\xa0al., 2022 ; Little et\xa0al., 2014 ). In their recent narrative review, Islam et\xa0al. ( 2022 ) describe how ‘exercise snacks’, which they define as discrete ≤1-min bouts of vigorous exercise performed periodically throughout the day, can lower blood glucose and insulin concentrations (Rafiei et\xa0al., 2021 ) and temporarily improve arterial haemodynamics (Caldwell et\xa0al., 2021 ). In the present context, exercise snacks can be considered as planned, structured and repetitive bouts of physical activity (Caspersen et\xa0al., 1985 ) rather than more general advice to increase vigorous intermittent lifestyle physical activity (VILPA; Stamatakis et\xa0al., 2021 ). Also, ‘vigorous’ refers to exercise at intensities ≥ 64% of , ≥77% of maximal heart rate and/or eliciting a rating of perceived exertion (RPE) of at least 14 based on the Borg 6–20 scale (Garber et\xa0al., 2011 ; Gibala & Little, 2020 ). In each of the original studies in Islam et\xa0al.’s review, ‘exercise snacks’ consisted of stair climbing completed 1–4\xa0h apart (Islam et\xa0al., 2022 ). The acute improvements in endothelial function resulting from these exercise snacks have been attributed to increased blood-flow induced shear stress, while the reductions in blood glucose concentrations probably involve non-insulin dependent glucose uptake by the active skeletal muscle (Daugaard & Richter, 2001 ). Collectively, the findings of Caldwell et\xa0al. ( 2021 ), Rafiei et\xa0al. ( 2021 ) and others have the potential to inform and extend recommendations aimed at reducing the negative consequences associated with prolonged sitting in the workplace and, in turn, improving cardiometabolic health over the lifespan. Exercise training and HIIT in cancer populations Regular exercise is estimated to reduce the risk of all-cause mortality and cancer-specific mortality by 30%–50% in breast cancer (Holmes et\xa0al., 2005 ), 44%–61% in prostate cancer (Kenfield et\xa0al., 2011 ) and 38%–50% in colorectal cancer (Schmid & Leitzmann, 2014 ). Suggested physiological mechanisms include decreases in systemic inflammation (Petersen & Pedersen, 2005 ), reductions in body fat (McTiernan, 2008 ), decreases in insulin-like growth factor-1, reductions in the circulating concentrations of sex hormones, improved immune function (Dethlefsen, Pedersen et\xa0al., 2017 ; Farley et\xa0al., 2022 ), and/or reduced oxidative stress (Guinan et\xa0al., 2013 ). Within the broader exercise oncology literature, a number of RCT's have examined the influence of HIIT on various health outcomes; the findings from these studies show that HIIT improves cardiorespiratory fitness, quality of life and body composition in a number of different cancer populations and that many of these changes occur in only 4\xa0weeks of training (Devin et\xa0al., 2016 ; Herranz-Gómez et\xa0al., 2022 ). However, in addition to these longer-term benefits that occur with training, there are also acute, transient responses to discrete bouts of exercise that have been shown to temporarily reduce the growth of cancer cells in vitro . The acute anti-tumour benefits of exercise To compare the influence of resting and post-exercise blood on cancer cell viability, Dethlefsen et\xa0al. ( 2016 ) sampled serum from breast cancer survivors before and after 2\xa0h of exercise. These samples were then applied to breast cancer cells (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231) in vitro . The authors reported that cancer cell viability was reduced following the application of the post-exercise serum, but not following the resting serum. Similar findings were reported by Devin et\xa0al. ( 2019 ), who examined the influence of resting and post-exercise serum on the growth of colon cancer cells (CaCo-2 and LoVo) in vitro . In their study, blood from colon cancer survivors was sampled at rest and immediately following 4\xa0×\xa04\xa0min of cycle ergometry at ∼85% ; growth of the colon cancer cells was suppressed, but only when the post-exercise serum was applied. In the same study, the authors found significant increases in IL-6, IL-8 and TNFα concentrations in their post-exercise blood samples (Devin et\xa0al., 2019 ). In vitro research with prostate cancer cell lines has yielded comparable results; Rundqvist et\xa0al. ( 2013 ) found that serum sampled from healthy males following 60\xa0min of cycling at increasing intensities suppressed the growth of LNCaP cells, while more recently, Kim et\xa0al. ( 2022 ) reported that when compared to resting serum, post-exercise serum sampled from advanced prostate cancer patients significantly suppressed the growth of prostate cancer cells (DU-145) in vitro . Exercise in this latter study involved participants completing 34\xa0min of moderate-to-high intensity interval exercise at ∼70%–85% maximum heart rate (MHR). Macroscopically, acute bouts of exercise can influence the tumour microenvironment via exercise-mediated increases in blood perfusion and by reducing tumour hypoxia (Koelwyn et\xa0al., 2017 ). In addition, evidence suggests that myokines (i.e. cytokines released from active skeletal muscle) affect the tumour microenvironment. A number of post-exercise blood-borne myokines, including oncostatin M (OSM), secreted protein acidic rich in cysteine (SPARC), irisin and decorin, have been implicated in suppressing the growth of cancer cell lines (Kim et\xa0al., 2021 ). Also associated is the exercise-mediated mobilisation of IL-6 sensitive NK cells that occurs in response to increases in systemic adrenalin concentrations during exercise (Pedersen et\xa0al., 2016 ). Indeed, Dethlefsen, Hansen et\xa0al. ( 2017 ) have shown that the acute catecholamine response to exercise is particularly important in facilitating the suppression of cancer cell growth. Using pre-clinical experimental models, this group has shown that blockade of β-adrenergic signalling can completely blunt exercise-mediated reductions in cell viability and tumour formation (Dethlefsen, Hansen et\xa0al., 2017 ). Research is yet to determine how intense and for how long an exercise bout needs to be for the necessary changes in serum to be elicited that will suppress the growth of cancer cells in vitro . In the pre-clinical studies reviewed above, exercise has ranged from 16\xa0min of HIIT (Devin et\xa0al., 2019 ) through to 2\xa0h of resistance exercise and high intensity ‘spin’ cycling (Dethlefsen et\xa0al., 2016 ). Whether intense ‘exercise snacks’ (<60\xa0s), similar to those that have been shown to improve glucose control and vascular function, could also suppress the growth of cancer cells is not yet clear. Nonetheless, it is reasonable to suggest that exercise, irrespective of the duration, will ideally need to be above the intensity that corresponds to an individual's anaerobic threshold, which is the intensity above which there is a significant increase in the contribution of anaerobic metabolism to the energy yield. Though this is yet to be experimentally tested, exercise involving the larger motor units, such as the case at more intense levels of exercise, will favour a greater production of myokines compared to lower-intensity exercise. The recruitment of the Type IIb motor units at exercise intensities above the anaerobic threshold will also be accompanied by a greater production and release of adrenalin and noradrenalin (Sales et\xa0al., 2019 ), and therefore, the mobilisation of NK cells would probably be higher (Dethlefsen, Hansen et\xa0al. 2017 ). Shah et\xa0al. ( 2019 ); Pedersen et\xa0al., 2016 have reported rapid increases in catecholamine release at exercise intensities above the ventilatory threshold, with catecholamine concentrations being positively correlated with exercise stages of increased power. Finally, the exercise will need to involve large muscle groups, so as to engage the highest possible number of contracting fibres and ensure a high net production and release of myokines into circulation. In addition to determining the optimal intensity and minimum duration of exercise that will potentially suppress cancer cell growth, the frequency of exercise is also an important variable to consider. The limited available pre-clinical evidence shows that the anti-tumour effect resulting from exercise is transient. Devin et\xa0al. ( 2019 ) found that compared to serum sampled immediately post-exercise, serum sampled 120\xa0min following their high intensity interval exercise had no influence on the growth of colon cancer cell lines. And in their study that showed reduced growth of cancer cells with serum sampled immediately post-exercise, Kim et\xa0al. ( 2022 ) reported that the increases in the serum concentrations of OSM, IL-6, SPARC and IL-15 that occurred in response to exercise, had returned to baseline within 30\xa0min following exercise. Thus, once exercise stops and skeletal muscle is no longer contracting, production and release of myokines also ceases. As homeostasis is restored and the myokines are removed from circulation, any potential cancer-suppressing influence diminishes. The importance of this is communicated in the title of the paper by Dethlefsen, Pedersen et\xa0al. ( 2017 ): ‘Every exercise bout matters: linking systemic exercise responses to breast cancer control’. Frequency of exercise therefore becomes important to take full advantage of the transient tumour suppressing effects of exercise. Indeed, it is entirely likely that the cumulative exposure to these transient acute effects of exercise is responsible for many of the improved outcomes in physically active cancer survivors. The ‘exercise snack’ hypothesis extends this framework to suggest that accumulating repetitive bouts of brief but sufficiently intense activity throughout a day could augment the potential cancer suppressive effects of regular exercise programmes by maximising the frequency of exposure to these transient post-exercise effects. Future directions A number of different lines of research are needed to build on the pre-clinical findings reviewed here and to test whether exercise snacks can be tolerated and should be recommended for those who have been diagnosed and treated for cancer. First, acute serum myokine, catecholamine and NK cell responses across different exercise interventions need to be compared. This will help identify a minimum intensity and duration of exercise that can elicit the changes in serum that have been associated with reduced cancer cell growth. Second, assessing the exercise capabilities and myokine responses with people at different points along the ‘cancer continuum’ i.e. before treatment, during treatment and following treatment, to brief bouts of vigorous exercise will inform the development of exercise recommendations. Third, different types of exercise snacks (e.g. home and community-based activities) that can each elicit significant increases in myokine concentrations need to be identified and tested by exercise physiologists to determine whether they can be tolerated and adopted. This is necessary for the pre-clinical and laboratory work to be translated to real-world settings. Finally, comparing the physiological responses to exercise snacks (i.e. planned, structured and repetitive physical activity) with more general, unstructured increases in daily physical activity, will establish whether exercise prescription in the current context is necessary – or whether those living with and beyond cancer need to simply increase their daily activity levels to gain the benefits from exercise-mediated myokine release. These directions for future research are summarised in Fig. 1 . Figure 1.

Conclusion Pre-clinical findings in the exercise oncology literature relating to the acute tumour suppressing effects of blood-borne factors suggest that brief, high intensity bouts of exercise may provide protection against cancer cell growth. Whether the prescription of ‘exercise snacks’ will be appropriate for this population will depend on future research that identifies the minimum duration and optimal intensity of exercise necessary to elicit the temporary excursions in systemic, circulating biomarkers (e.g. myokines) in serum that are associated with the tumour suppression, and determining whether this form of exercise is tolerated and acceptable for people living with cancer. Finally, it is important to highlight that we are not advocating that ‘exercise snacks’ or frequent, brief bouts of vigorous exercise replace all other exercise activities that enable individuals to meet the current physical activity guidelines. Rather, the potential value will come from having these exercise bouts embedded within an individual exercise programme and contributing to overall daily physical activity levels.

Dela 1 Show authors 4772 Accesses 7 Altmetric Explore all metrics Abstract Aims/hypothesis We evaluated and compared the effects on glycaemic control of two different exercise protocols in elderly men with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Methods Eighteen patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus carried out home-based bicycle training for 5\xa0weeks. Patients were randomly assigned to one of two training programmes at 60% of maximal oxygen uptake: three 10\xa0min sessions per day (3\u2009×\u200910) or one 30\xa0min session per day (1\u2009×\u200930). Plasma insulin, C-peptide and glucose concentrations were measured during a 3\xa0h oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Insulin sensitivity index (ISI composite ), pre-hepatic insulin secretion rates (ISR) and change in insulin secretion per unit change in glucose concentrations (B total ) were calculated. Results Cardiorespiratory fitness increased in response to training in both groups. In group 3\u2009×\u200910 ( n =\u20099) fasting plasma glucose ( p =\u20090.01), 120\xa0min glucose OGTT ( p =\u20090.04) and plasma glucose concentration areas under the curve at 120\xa0min ( p <\u20090.04) and 180\xa0min ( p =\u20090.07) decreased. These parameters remained unchanged in group 1\u2009×\u200930 ( n =\u20099). No significant changes were found in ISI composite , ISR and B total in either of the exercise groups. In a matched time-control group ( n =\u200910), glycaemic control did not change. Conclusions/interpretation Moderate to high-intensity training performed at 3\u2009×\u200910\xa0min/day is preferable to 1\u2009×\u200930\xa0min/day with regard to effects on glycaemic control. This is in spite of the fact that cardiorespiratory fitness increased similarly in both exercise groups. A possible explanation is that the energy expenditure associated with multiple short daily sessions may be greater than that in a single daily session.

Introduction At the time of diagnosis approximately one-half of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus have symptoms of long-term complications. A positive association has been found between the glycaemic level and the risk of complications [ 1 , 2 ]. Furthermore, fasting blood glucose has found to be positively associated with mortality [ 3 , 4 ]. To prevent and delay these severe long-term complications, good glycaemic control is a major goal in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Exercise is considered to be a substantial part of the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus [ 5 ]. In a meta-analysis of Boulé et al. [ 6 ], exercise training was found to reduce HbA 1c by 0.66 percentage points. This is close to the effect of intense glucose-lowering pharmacological treatment found in the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study [ 1 ]. The National Board of Health and the Danish Diabetes Association recommends that all adults, including type 2 diabetic patients, should be physically active with at least 30\xa0min of moderate intensity every day. The current recommendation is that the physical activity may be accumulated during the day, for instance in three bouts of 10\xa0min. However, in patients with type 2 diabetes this is not based on solid experimental evidence. In healthy men, evidence has been found for improvements in physical fitness after long-term aerobic exercise of moderate intensity performed both in single exercise sessions, as well as in multiple short-term sessions [ 7 ]; in patients with type 2 diabetes only the acute effect on glucose control of dividing the exercise session into smaller bouts has been studied [ 8 ]. Evidence of long-term effects on glycaemic control based on the present recommendations of physical activity has to our knowledge not been documented for type 2 diabetic patients. The aim of the present study was to investigate and compare the effect on glycaemic control of two different exercise interventions: a single exercise session of 30\xa0min/day (group 1\u2009×\u200930) or three short (10\xa0min) exercise sessions per day (group 3\u2009×\u200910). Data from such a study may support future exercise recommendations in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Methods Patients We recruited patients through advertisements in newspapers. The inclusion criteria were: men diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus, aged 50 to 70\xa0years, BMI >27\xa0kg/m 2 , treated with diet and/or oral glucose-lowering medication and not participating in any vigorous physical activity. Patients were initially screened through a telephone interview and were only included if they had no history of cardiovascular disease or other chronic conditions that would preclude the ability to engage in exercise on an ergometer bike. Of the 18 patients that completed the intervention, six had diet-controlled diabetes and 12 were being treated with oral hypoglycaemic drugs. During the study period medication levels were not modified. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients. The study was approved by the local ethics committee in accordance with the guidelines published in the declaration of Helsinki. Study design Patients were randomised to one of two exercise groups: 3\u2009×\u200910\xa0min/day ( n =\u200910) or 1\u2009×\u200930\xa0min/day ( n =\u200913). A time-control group was also included ( n =\u200910). In the intervention groups, the patients were tested before initialising the training and in the fifth week of training (see below). Blood samples were collected at least 16\xa0h after the last exercise bout. In one patient in the 1\u2009×\u200930 group, blood was sampled later at 72\xa0h after the last exercise bout. The result from this particular patient was in line with those from the other patients. Patients in the time-control group were tested twice, with 4 to 5\xa0weeks in-between. Patient inclusion The patient inclusion procedure is illustrated in Fig. 1 . A total of 23 men volunteered to participate after receiving written information about the study. Of these, 19 completed the intervention, one of whom was subsequently excluded for not adhering to the exercise protocol. Fig.\xa01 Study design. *The majority of those excluded did not fulfil the inclusion criteria mainly with regard to BMI, cardiovascular disease and level of physical activity. Of those who declined, five withdrew for specific reasons and three for unknown reasons. † Two patients withdrew after the first test day, one due to changes in job situation, the other for unknown reasons. Two patients withdrew during the first week of the exercise period, one due to additional disease and one who found the exercise too strenuous and time-consuming. Finally, one patient was excluded from the analysis for not adhering to the required level of intensity Full size image All patients were tested at Department of Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Copenhagen before initialising the training and in the fifth week of training. Baseline characteristics The patients were overweight or obese (BMI 27–41\xa0kg/m 2 ), had abdominal adiposity (waist circumference >94\xa0cm) and were normo- or hypertensive (120–170/70–100\xa0mmHg). The time since the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus ranged from 1 to 14\xa0years, and HbA 1c and fasting capillary glucose concentration indicated both good and poor glycaemic control at baseline (HbA 1c 5.9–10.5%, capillary glucose 7.0–14.6\xa0mmol/l) (Table 1 ). Table\xa01 Baseline characteristics Full size table At baseline there were no significant differences between the groups with the exception of BMI, which was slightly higher in group 3×10 than in group 1×30 ( p =\u20090.03) (Table 1 ). Experimental day On the experimental days the patients arrived at the laboratory in the morning after a 9\xa0h fast and abstinence from their usual glucose-lowering medical treatment. The patients were instructed to avoid strenuous physical activity on the morning of the experiment. Body weight and height were measured. The fat mass of each patient was determined by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scan (LUNAR DPX-IQ; Lunar Corporation, Madison, WI, USA). The waist circumference was measured in an upright posture at the widest part of the abdomen. Blood pressure was measured, and resting and exercise ECGs were obtained. A capillary blood sample was taken to measure fasting capillary blood glucose and venous blood samples were collected for biochemical analysis (Table 1 ). The patients then underwent a 3\xa0h oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), ingesting a solution of 75\xa0g glucose dissolved in 300\xa0ml water. During the OGTT the hand of the patient was placed in a heating pad in order to obtain arterialised blood samples. Blood was sampled before and during the OGTT for measurement of plasma glucose (ABL, series 700; Radiometer, Copenhagen, Denmark), insulin and C-peptide concentrations. Glucose tolerance Glucose tolerance was measured by calculating the area under the curve (AUC) for plasma glucose concentrations during the OGTT by means of the trapezoidal rule. Areas were calculated for 2 and 3\xa0h. The AUC was also calculated for plasma insulin and C-peptide concentrations. Insulin sensitivity To estimate whole-body insulin sensitivity an insulin sensitivity index (ISI composite ) developed by Matsuda and DeFronzo [ 9 ] was used: $$ {\\text{ISI}}_{{{\\text{composite}}}} {\\text{ }} = \\frac{{10,000}} {{{\\sqrt {{\\text{FPG}} \\times {\\text{FPI}} \\times {\\text{MeanGluOGTT}}_{{0 - 120\\,\\min }}  \\times {\\text{MeanInsOGTT}}_{{0 - 120\\,\\min }} } }}} $$ The value 10,000 represents a constant, which allows values ranging from 0 to 12 to be obtained. FPG and FPI are the fasting plasma glucose (mg/dl) and fasting plasma insulin (μU/ml), respectively. MeanGluOGTT 0–120\xa0min and MeanInsOGTT 0–120\xa0min are the average of the plasma glucose and plasma insulin concentrations measured at −10, 0, 30, 60, 90 and 120\xa0min during the OGTT. Insulin secretion rates and beta cell responsiveness The pre-hepatic insulin secretion rates (ISR) were calculated by the computer program ISEC (insulin secretion) by deconvolution of plasma C-peptide concentrations [ 10 ]. From the ISR the AUC during the OGTT (AUC OGTT ISR 0–180\xa0min ) was calculated. Thus, AUC OGTT ISR 0–180\xa0min is an expression of the total amount of pre-hepatic insulin secreted during the OGTT [ 11 ]. The individual relationships between plasma glucose concentrations and ISRs during the OGTT were evaluated by cross-correlation analysis. The change in insulin secretion per unit change in glucose concentrations (B total ) is used as a measure of beta cell responsiveness [ 11 ]. Cardiorespiratory fitness Cardiorespiratory fitness was determined by a sub-maximal exercise test, in which patients worked below maximal effort, followed by a maximal exercise test, in which patients worked until exhaustion. The exercise tests were performed on an ergometer bike. The sub-maximal exercise test was 8\xa0min duration with incrementally increasing workloads (40, 60, 75 and 90\xa0W). Before and at the end of each workload, capillary blood samples were obtained and analysed for lactate concentration (ABL 700; Radiometer). In the maximal exercise test, the baseline workload and the stepwise increment in workload were individually determined for each patient, depending on his level of exertion during the sub-maximal exercise test. The intention was for all patients to reach a respiratory exchange ratio greater than 1.0 and/or a heart rate at the age-predicted maximum (220\u2009−\u2009age [years]). A capillary blood sample was taken at maximum exhaustion level and analysed for lactate concentration. Oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production were measured using a Jaeger OxyconPro (Intramedic A/S, Lyngby, Denmark). Intervention The exercise intervention was home-based and consisted of 30\xa0min of training 6\xa0days/week for 4 to 5\xa0weeks at a moderate to high intensity on an ergometer bike (Monark 828E or 818E; Monark Exercise AB, Varberg, Sweden). The appropriate workload was prescribed on an individual basis corresponding to 60 to 65% of maximal oxygen uptake \\( {\\left( {\\ifmmode\\expandafter\\dot\\else\\expandafter\\.\\fi{V}O_{{2\\max }} } \\right)} \\) achieved during maximal exercise test. Patients were instructed to adjust the intensity by means of perception of exertion (corresponding to level 13–14 [somewhat hard] on the Borg Scale) combined with heart rate monitoring. Workloads were increased as fitness increased, thus maintaining a constant relative workload. The patients wore a heart rate monitor (POLAR S610i; Polar Electro Oy, Kempele, Finland), allowing control of compliance in terms of exercise time and intensity. During the exercise intervention we contacted the patients by telephone (one to five calls) or by home visits (one to two visits) to encourage and supervise according to individual needs. The patients who performed exercise in multiple sessions per day were requested to spread the three sessions throughout the day (morning, afternoon, evening). This requested spreading of exercise sessions was also controlled by means of the heart rate monitors. Beyond the exercise sessions the patients were requested to maintain their usual daily level of activity and sustain normal eating habits. Time-control group The patients who were enrolled for the time-control group went through the test day twice with 4 to 5\xa0weeks in-between. Subsequently, they initiated the exercise intervention. During the time-control period the patients were requested to maintain their usual diet and activity habits. Statistical tests Calculations were performed by SPSS version 13. Two sided p values less than 0.05 were defined as statistically significant. If parameters deviated from the normal distribution or if variance homogeneity was not found, data were log-transformed. Baseline values are presented as means and SD or ranges. An unpaired t test was used to compare baseline values between the two exercise groups and between exercise groups and the time-control group. Group differences are presented as percentage change for log-transformed data and as means if not log-transformed. Both are presented with 95% CIs. The effects of exercise were analysed by comparing baseline and after training values in each of the two groups by a paired t test. An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to compare effects between the two exercise groups. In an ANCOVA each parameter is adjusted by its baseline value. To determine the effect in cardiorespiratory fitness, we used a three-way ANOVA with repeated measurements for lactate and heart rate values during sub-maximal exercise tests. Finally, a paired t test was used for comparison of the two test days in the time-control group. Results Cardiorespiratory fitness and compliance In both exercise groups, submaximal heart rate and plasma lactate concentrations decreased to a similar degree after training (Table 2 , Fig. 2 ). \\( \\ifmmode\\expandafter\\dot\\else\\expandafter\\.\\fi{V}O_{{2\\max }} \\) increased by 9% ( p =\u20090.05) and 15% ( p =\u20090.07) in group 3\u2009×\u200910 and group 1\u2009×\u200930, respectively.

Error bars , SE Full size image None of the calculated indices of insulin sensitivity or insulin secretion (ISI composite , ISR or B total ) changed with the exercise intervention in any of the groups (3\u2009×\u200910, 1\u2009×\u200930 or time control group) (Table 2 ). HbA 1c , lipids, anthropometric measures and blood pressure Despite a significant effect of training on glycaemic control in group 3\u2009×\u200910, HbA 1c did not change in any of the two groups after the training period (Table 2 ), which may be explained by the relative short duration of the intervention (less than 3\xa0months). No statistically significant changes in weight, total fat mass, waist circumference, BMI, blood pressure and lipids were observed in either of the groups. A decrease, albeit somewhat variable and not statistically significant, in systolic/diastolic blood pressure was seen in group 3\u2009×\u200910 \\( {\\left( { - 4{{\\left[ {{\\text{range}} - 11.0\\,{\\text{to}}\\,3.0} \\right]}} \\mathord{\\left/ {\\vphantom {{{\\left[ {{\\text{range}} - 11.0\\,{\\text{to}}\\,3.0} \\right]}} { - 4.4{\\left[ {{\\text{range}} - 10.8\\,{\\text{to}}\\,1.9} \\right]}{\\text{mmHg}}}}} \\right. \\kern-\\nulldelimiterspace} { - 4.4{\\left[ {{\\text{range}} - 10.8\\,{\\text{to}}\\,1.9} \\right]}{\\text{mmHg}}}} \\right)} \\) . No significant changes were found in these parameters after pooling data from the intervention groups (data not shown). The time-control group did not experience any changes in the above parameters at the end of the time-control period (data not shown). Comparing the two exercise groups adjusted for differences in baseline values for each of the parameters (ANCOVA), we found that fasting capillary plasma glucose differed between the two exercise groups after training (13.8% [range 2.3–26.8%], p =\u20090.02). No significant differences between the two exercise groups were found in the remainder of the parameters. Discussion After 4 to 5\xa0weeks of aerobic training performed at moderate to high intensity work rates, both exercise groups improved their cardiorespiratory fitness independently of group assignment. Nonetheless, glycaemic control, in terms of fasting glucose concentrations and glucose tolerance, only improved in the exercise group performing three short 10\xa0min exercise sessions per day (group 3\u2009×\u200910). In the exercise group performing one single daily exercise session of 30\xa0min (group 1\u2009×\u200930) glycaemic control did not change. Both intervention groups improved their cardiorespiratory fitness, carried out the same accumulated amount of exercise and had an equally high compliance with training. It may therefore seem puzzling that glycaemic control should have improved only in the 3\u2009×\u200910 group. A likely explanation is the possibility that total energy expenditure during training performed as multiple sessions is higher than that during one single session per day. Thus, due to the performance of three exercise bouts per day instead of one, group 3\u2009×\u200910 probably had a higher total excess post-exercise oxygen consumption (EPOC) and thereby higher total energy expenditure. Following each of the exercise bouts, slightly elevated body temperature directly stimulates metabolism to increase recovery oxygen consumption. Moreover, restoration of pulmonary ventilation, as well as circulation and redistribution of calcium, potassium and sodium ions within muscle and other compartments also require additional energy. The notion that total EPOC for three separate 10\xa0min exercise bouts is larger than EPOC for one 30\xa0min exercise bout is supported by experimental evidence [ 12 ], where it has been shown that a tripling of treadmill walking time from 20\xa0min to 60\xa0min, only doubled EPOC. However, in the present study, the difference in total energy expenditure between the two exercise interventions was probably so small that it made no difference to the cardiovascular fitness outcome. It is well known that even very small increases in daily energy expenditure can improve glucose homeostasis without affecting cardiorespiratory fitness [ 13 ]. Altogether, the present findings are in accordance with the general belief that it is the total amount of energy spent in the exercise programme that determines the metabolic outcome [ 14 , 15 ]. None of the calculated parameters, i.e. insulin sensitivity (ISI composite ), B total , AUC OGTT 0–180 min C-peptide, AUC OGTT 0–180 min insulin and AUC OGTT 0–180 min ISR, changed in response to training in any of the exercise groups. Thus, it is impossible to deduce a clear mechanism to explain the improvement in glucose tolerance in group 3\u2009×\u200910 vs group 1\u2009×\u200930. A similar discrepancy between improvements in glucose tolerance and changes in measures of insulin sensitivity, insulin secretion and metabolic clearance rate of insulin has been reported previously [ 16 ]. In that study the exercise modality and intensity were quite similar to that of the present study (group 1\u2009×\u200930) and an improvement in glucose tolerance was reported. However, the training programme was of longer duration (6–10\xa0weeks) and newly diagnosed patients were studied [ 16 ], in contrast to the present study. Short-term (<6\xa0weeks) exercise programmes in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus do not always improve glycaemic control [ 17 ]. No changes in any of the anthropometrical parameters (BMI, weight, waist circumference and fat mass) were observed in the two exercise groups in the present study. Thus, the improvement of glycaemic control in group 3\u2009×\u200910 was independent of changes in body composition. This is in good agreement with the compatible study by Reitman et al. [ 16 ] and is also supported by a meta-analysis [ 17 ] including 14 studies of long-term exercise interventions. Thus exercise training can be viewed as beneficial on its own, not merely as an avenue to weight loss. The fact that the body weight did not change in spite of considerable exercise efforts for 4 to 5\xa0weeks in all patients must imply that either the patients increased their daily energy intake or they diminished their habitual physical activity level outside the scheduled training bouts or they did both. Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus comprise a very heterogeneous group with highly variable degrees, e.g. of glycaemic control, body weight, co-morbidities and duration of the disease. Accordingly, the response to exercise training with regard to glucose homeostasis will vary considerably [ 18 – 20 ]. It may therefore be important to distinguish between different subgroups of type 2 diabetic patients. The fact that no significant effects were seen in group 1\u2009×\u200930\xa0min should therefore not be interpreted strictly and should not discourage patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus from taking exercise. The inclusion criteria for participation in the intervention study enabled us to study the effect of exercise on glycaemic control in a selected target group (middle-aged, overweight, male and sedentary). The patients enrolled for the study on their own initiative. Thus, it is not certain that these patients can be considered a representative sample of overweight/obese type 2 diabetic men in the age group 50–70\xa0years. It is likely that the volunteers are a highly selected group on the basis of health consciousness and motivation. Consequently, it is possible that they responded differently to training than other patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in the selected target group. Obviously, this should be considered before generalising the results to the rest of the population. A difference in distribution of baseline values between the two exercise groups might distort the effects of training, and in the present study BMI was differently distributed. It cannot be excluded that the difference in BMI between the groups (Table 1 ) might have influenced the response to training [ 21 ]. However, due to the consecutive recruitment of patients, it was not possible to match for BMI. The distribution of BMI was simply the result of the randomised allocation to the exercise intervention groups. Another way to control the distortion would be to adjust for BMI in the analysis. However, with a study sample of no more than 18 persons, the quality of such analysis would be doubtful. It is well recognised that exercise-induced improvements in glycaemic control diminish when exercise is no longer taken. Training-induced improvements in skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity are lost after 6 to 8\xa0days of de-training [ 22 , 23 ]. Furthermore, a study of Schneider et al. [ 19 ] showed that plasma glucose levels measured twice in the same patient were significantly lower at 12\xa0h after exercise than at 72\xa0h. We collected all blood samples at least 16\xa0h after and no later than 72\xa0h after the last exercise bout (one patient only), but inspection of individual data showed that there was no association between time from last exercise bout and the level of improvement in glycaemic control, indicating that timing of measurements did not affect the results. Unfortunately, many patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus are physically inactive. Attempts to engage patients in regular training have been disappointing, [ 24 , 25 ]. The need for methods to incorporate regular exercise as part of the patients’ daily activities should be emphasised. The challenge at present must be to translate research findings into practical recommendations with a view to preventing or delaying the long-term complications of diabetes and thereby improving health and quality of life of all individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Involvement and encouragement by the general practitioner is essential [ 26 ]. Based on the present results, our recommendation is that multiple sessions (3\u2009×\u200910\xa0min) of aerobic exercise are preferable to one long session (1\u2009×\u200930\xa0min), provided that the goal is improvement of glycaemic control. However, if multiple exercise sessions are virtually impossible, it is worth noting that both exercise regimens have several other positive effects on health, which are independent of glycaemic control.

Therefore, developing effective approaches and convenient means to cope with their mood problems is important nowadays. Physical activity has been consistently reported as a cost-effective way to improve physical fitness, prevent mental illnesses, and alleviate mood problems. In this systematic review, the effects of exercise intensity, duration, and modality on mood change are discussed. Results show that moderate-intensity anaerobic exercise is associated with greater mood improvements. The relationship between exercise duration and mood change is non-linear; A regime of 10- to 30-minute exercise is sufficient for mood improvements. For exercise modality, anaerobic exercise improves mood, but the efficacy of aerobic and mindfulness-related exercises remains to be further examined. In addition to the systematic review of potential moderators, a narrative review of psychological and neurophysiological theories of exercise effects on mood is provided; we have highlighted the central role of neuroplasticity in integrating the two classes of theories. An adoption of neuroimaging techniques in future research is critical to reveal the mechanisms underpinning the therapeutic influence of physical activity on affective responses. Some future research directions are also raised. Keywords: Anxiety depression neuropsychology stress and coping Disclosure statement The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest.

Keywords: physical activity, exercise, bouts Introduction Physical activity recommendations have traditionally focused on moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), and this was interpreted as activity performed in a continuous manner. The historical perspective of these recommendations was summarized in the US Surgeon General’s Report on Physical Activity and Health ( 1 ). In the mid-1980’s, Haskell suggested that some forms of physical activity may not result in an improvement in physical fitness, but the acute effects of repetition of physical activity may still result in improvements in health ( 2 ). Emerging evidence began to support the concept that physical activity could have beneficial effects when accumulated in multiple shorter bouts performed across the day rather than solely relying on one longer continuous bout of physical activity. For example, one of the first empirical studies was conducted by Ebisu et al . ( 3 ), and results demonstrated that multiple bouts of running equivalent to 30 minutes per day (e.g., 3 session of 10 minutes) over a period of 8 weeks improved cardiorespiratory fitness and improved high-density lipoprotein (HDL) in young men. Pate et al . published the first contemporary recommendation, on behalf of the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM), for MVPA to be “accumulated” to achieve a specific threshold of daily physical activity that, in turn, could result in health and fitness benefits ( 4 ). This recommendation stated that “intermittent bouts of physical activity, as short as 8 to 10 minutes, totaling 30 minutes or more on most days provided beneficial health and fitness effects.” This resulted in a new paradigm, suggesting the accumulation of physical activity across bouts of short duration would provide health benefits. This paradigm was reinforced in the report by Haskell et al . ( 5 ) in the physical activity recommendations for adults from the ACSM and the American Heart Association (AHA). The 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans continued to support this recommendation for adults, stating that “aerobic activity should be performed in episodes of ≥10 minutes” ( 6 ). The 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee (PAGAC) recognized, however, that not all free-living physical activity is performed in a continuous manner, and most activity is likely performed in episodes typically <10 minutes in duration. An example of this may be the short and sporadic bouts of physical activity that can be performed in selective agricultural, goods producing, and manufacturing occupations. Church et al . ( 7 ) have demonstrated that these types of occupations have been decreasing in prevalence which has contributed to a decrease in total energy expenditure, mostly due to a decrease in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, which may also be associated with negative health consequences. Thus, the 2018 PAGAC examined the available scientific literature to determine if physical activity episodes of <10 minutes in duration have health-related benefits; or, alternatively, if the benefits are only realized when the duration of physical activity episodes is ≥10 minutes. METHODS The overarching methods used to conduct systematic reviews informing the 2018 PAGAC Scientific Report are described in detail elsewhere ( 8 , 9 ). The searches were conducted using electronic databases (PubMed®, CINAHL, and Cochrane). An initial search was conducted to identify systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and pooled analyses examining the relationship between bout duration and various health outcomes; and this search did not identify sufficient literature to answer the proposed research question. Therefore, a de novo search of original research was conducted until June 2017 for the 2018 PAGAC report. This de novo search of original research was expanded to include literature published through March 2018 for inclusion in this manuscript. Eligibility criteria were original research studies published in English; examining bouts as the physical activity exposure among adults; and health outcomes including weight status, body composition, blood lipids, blood pressure, metabolic syndrome, risk of type 2 diabetes, and risk of cardiovascular disease. The full search strategy is available at https://health.gov/paguidelines/second-edition/report/supplementary_material/pdf/Exposure_Q5_Bouts_Evidence_Portfolio.pdf . For the search conducted to include literature through March 2018, additional outcomes such as frailty and all-cause mortality were permissible as outcomes. Search terms included bout-specific terms combined with outcome-specific terms. However, the PAGAC Scientific Report ( 30 ) included a specific section related to high-intensity interval training (HIIT) that was separate from this review, and therefore the literature specific to HIIT is not included in this review. The titles and abstracts of the identified articles were independently screened by two reviewers. The full-text of relevant articles were reviewed to identify those meeting the inclusion criteria. Two professional abstractors independently abstracted data and conducted a quality or risk of bias assessment using the USDA NEL Bias Assessment Tool (BAT) ( 10 ). Discrepancies in article selection or data abstractions were resolved by discussion or by a third reviewer, if needed. The protocol for this review was registered with the PROSPERO database registration (CRD42018092854). The summary of the review process for the articles included in this systematic review is shown in Figure 1 . Figure 1. Open in a new tab Summary of literature search. RESULTS Search Results For the 2018 PAGAC Report, 25 original manuscripts published from 1995 to 2017, based on 23 original studies, that examined the relationship between bouts of physical activity and different health outcomes were included as sources of evidence ( 11 – 35 ). Two pairs of these studies reported on different outcomes from the same studies ( 12 – 15 ). Of the 23 studies examined, 11 used a cross-sectional design ( 14 – 17 , 21 – 23 , 26 , 27 , 31 , 32 , 34 ), 2 used a prospective design ( 18 , 36 ), and 10 used a randomized design ( 11 – 13 , 19 , 20 , 24 , 25 , 28 – 30 , 35 ). The additional search conducted through March 2018 resulted in four additional original research studies, including one randomized control trial ( 37 ), one prospective cohort ( 38 ), and two cross-sectional studies ( 39 , 40 ). The analytical sample size across these various studies ranged from 22 to 6,321. A summary of the articles, by study design and health outcomes examined, is shown in Table 1 . Table 1. Summary of study designs that examined physical activity bout duration by health outcome.

The majority of studies (n=18) used objective measure to assess physical activity that included accelerometers ( 14 , 15 , 17 , 18 , 21 – 26 , 31 – 34 , 38 – 41 ), with other studies using a heart rate monitor and pedometer ( 30 ), a combination of self-report and heart rate monitor ( 12 , 29 , 35 ), and direct supervision of physical activity sessions ( 19 , 37 ). The remaining four studies used self-report (exercise logs and diaries) to quantify physical activity ( 11 , 13 , 20 , 28 ). Duration of Bouts The duration of bouts varied across the studies that were examined. Cross-sectional ( 14 – 17 , 21 – 23 , 26 , 27 , 31 , 32 , 34 , 39 , 40 ) and prospective studies ( 18 , 36 , 38 ) reported on bouts of physical activity that were <10 minutes, whereas randomized studies ( 11 – 13 , 19 , 20 , 24 , 25 , 28 – 30 , 35 , 37 ) reported only on bouts that were ≥10 minutes in duration. Physical Activity Bout Duration and Health Outcomes: Randomized Studies Twelve manuscripts reported on randomized designs, and these studies only included bouts of physical activity that were ≥10 minutes in duration ( 11 – 13 , 19 , 20 , 24 , 25 , 28 – 30 , 35 , 37 ). In these studies intermittent bouts resulted in similar or enhanced effects when compared to continuous bouts of physical activity of longer duration for outcomes of weight and body composition ( 11 – 13 , 19 , 20 , 24 , 25 , 28 – 30 , 35 , 37 ), blood pressure ( 12 , 19 , 20 , 24 , 28 , 37 ), blood lipids ( 12 , 19 , 28 , 29 , 35 ), or glucose or insulin ( 12 , 19 , 37 ). These studies, however, do not provide information to evaluate bouts of physical activity of <10 minutes in duration. Physical Activity Bout Duration and Health Outcomes: Cross-Sectional and Prospective Studies The cross-sectional and prospective studies reported on a variety of health outcomes that included body weight or body composition ( 15 , 16 , 21 , 23 , 26 , 27 , 31 , 34 , 36 ), blood pressure ( 27 , 34 , 36 ), blood lipids ( 14 , 18 , 23 , 27 , 34 ), glucose or insulin ( 22 , 26 , 34 ), metabolic syndrome ( 17 , 26 ), inflammatory biomarkers ( 27 , 34 ), a composite of cardiovascular disease risk ( 32 ), frailty ( 39 ), or multimorbidity ( 40 ). In addition, a more recent study reported on all-cause mortality ( 38 ). A brief summary of these findings by health outcome are presented below and also presented in Table 2 . Table 2. Summary of the number of studies where health benefits are observed when physical activity in bouts ≥10 minutes is compare to bouts <10 minutes.

Some studies have examined whether physical activity accumulated in bouts <10 minutes in duration are associated with body mass index (BMI) or body fatness ( 15 , 16 , 21 , 23 , 26 , 27 , 31 , 34 , 36 ). In a cohort study by White et al. ( 36 ), physical activity accumulated in bouts of ≥10 minutes in duration was associated with lower incidence of obesity, whereas physical activity accumulated in <10 minutes was not associated with lower incidence of obesity. In cross-sectional studies examining BMI, two favored physical activity accumulated in bouts of ≥10 minutes compared to physical activity accumulated in bouts <10 minutes ( 27 , 34 ), one favored physical activity accumulated in <10 minute bouts ( 16 ), and three did not report a difference between physical activity accumulated in bouts <10 minutes versus bouts of ≥10 minutes ( 21 , 23 , 26 ). Of the seven cross-sectional studies examining measures of body fatness, one favored physical activity accumulated in bouts of ≥10 minutes ( 31 ), one reported that the association between total volume of physical activity was more strongly associated with cardiometabolic health than physical activity accumulated in bouts of ≥10 minutes ( 34 ), and five studies showed no difference between physical activity accumulated in bouts of ≥10 minutes versus physical activity not accumulated in bouts of ≥10 minutes ( 15 , 16 , 23 , 26 , 27 ). Resting Blood Pressure: Evidence for resting blood pressure is available from one cohort study and two cross-sectional studies. In the cohort study ( 36 ) demonstrated that physical activity in bouts of either ≥10 minutes or <10 minutes in duration was associated with lower incidence of hypertension. In both of the cross-sectional studies showed that physical activity accumulated in bouts <10 minutes was associated with lower resting blood pressure ( 27 , 34 ). Blood Lipids: One cross-sectional study showed physical activity accumulated in bouts of ≥10 minutes or <10 minutes in duration was associated with lower total cholesterol ( 27 ). In the one cross-sectional study examining LDL cholesterol, both physical activity accumulated in bouts of ≥10 minutes in duration and in <10 minutes in duration were inversely associated with LDL cholesterol ( 27 ). For HDL cholesterol, the one prospective study, which was only 14 weeks in duration, reported that physical activity accumulated in bouts of ≥10 minutes in duration predicted change in HDL, whereas when the threshold was reduced to include bouts of at least 5 minutes this pattern of physical activity was not predictive of change in HDL ( 18 ). Of the four cross-sectional studies reviewed, two showed similar associations between HDL and physical activity accumulated in bouts of ≥10 minutes and <10 minutes ( 23 , 27 ), one showed that physical activity accumulated in bouts as short as at least 32 seconds was associated with higher HDL ( 14 ), and one showed physical activity accumulated in bouts <10 minutes was more strongly associated with HDL than physical activity accumulated in ≥10 minutes ( 34 ). Three cross-sectional studies examined the association between physical activity and triglycerides. In two of these studies, there were similar associations of triglycerides with physical activity accumulated in bouts of ≥10 minutes in duration or in bouts <10 minutes ( 23 , 27 ). One of these studies showed physical activity accumulated in bouts of <10 minutes was more strongly associated with lower triglycerides than physical activity accumulated in bouts of ≥10 minutes ( 34 ). Fasting Glucose, Fasting Insulin, and HbA1c. Three cross-sectional studies examined the association between physical activity and fasting glucose ( 14 , 27 , 34 ), two with fasting insulin ( 26 , 34 ), and one with HbA1c ( 22 ). For fasting glucose, in one study bouts of physical activity at least 3 minutes in duration were associated with lower fasting glucose ( 14 ), in one study there was no difference in the association between fasting glucose and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity accumulated in bouts of <10 minute versus bouts of ≥10 minutes ( 27 ), and in one study physical activity accumulated in bouts of <10 minutes was more strongly associated with lower fasting glucose when compared to physical activity accumulated in bouts of ≥10 minutes ( 34 ). For fasting insulin, one study showed no difference in the association when comparing moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity accumulated in <10 minutes and ≥10 minutes ( 26 ), and one study showed physical activity accumulated in bouts of <10 minutes was more strongly associated fasting insulin when compared to physical activity accumulated in bouts of ≥10 minutes in duration ( 34 ). In the one study examining HbA1c, physical activity accumulated in bouts <10 minutes predicted lower HbA1c, whereas physical activity accumulated in bouts of ≥10 minutes in duration was not predictive of lower HbA1c ( 22 ). Metabolic Syndrome. Two cross-sectional studies were reviewed that reported on the association between physical activity and metabolic syndrome ( 17 , 26 ). In one study, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity accumulated in bouts of 1 to 9 minutes, 4 to 9 minutes, or 7 to 9 minutes in duration predicted lower odds of having metabolic syndrome ( 42 ) independent of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity accumulated in bouts of ≥10 minutes ( 17 ). In an additional study odds of having metabolic syndrome ( 43 ) did not differ when comparing physical activity accumulated in bouts of <10 minutes versus ≥10 minutes ( 26 ). C-Reactive Protein. Two cross-sectional studies examined the association between physical activity and c-reactive protein ( 27 , 34 ). One study showed no difference in the association between c-reactive protein and physical activity accumulated in bouts of <10 minutes in duration and bouts of ≥10 minutes ( 27 ). One study showed that physical activity accumulated in bouts of <10 minutes was more strongly associated with lower c-reactive protein when compared to physical activity accumulated in bouts of ≥10 minutes ( 34 ). Cardiovascular Risk Score. One cross-sectional study examined the association between physical activity and the Framingham Cardiovascular Disease Risk Score ( 32 ). In this study, physical activity accumulated in bouts of 1 to 5 minutes, 6 to 10 minutes, 11 to 15 minutes, or 20 to 120 minutes in duration and during total waking time were negatively associated with Framingham Cardiovascular Disease Risk Score. Frailty. Aging is typically associated with an increase in frailty. Kehler et al . examined data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey to determine if MVPA performed in bouts of ≥10 minutes had a differential influence on the frailty index compared to MVPA performed in bouts of <10 minutes in adults 50 years of age or older ( 39 ). In this study, meeting 50–99% of 150 minutes per week of MVPA was associated with a reduced frailty index, with similar findings observed regardless of whether MVPA was performed in bouts of ≥10 minutes or in bouts of <10 minutes. Multi-Morbidity. Multi-morbidity is the presence of two or more chronic conditions such as coronary artery disease, stroke, congestive heart failure, hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and others. Loprinzi examined data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey to determine if physical activity bouts that were ≥10 minutes in duration or were <10 minutes in duration were associated with multi-morbidity ( 40 ). In this analysis, both bouts of MVPA ≥10 minutes in duration and those <10 minutes in duration were independently associated with the presence of multi-morbidity. These findings provide support for promoting MVPA regardless of bout duration. All-Cause Mortality. A recent finding is based on the data that are now available regarding physical activity bout duration and all-cause mortality. In a prospective examination of data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, Saint-Maurice et al. examined the influence of MVPA of different bout durations (total MVPA regardless of bout duration, MVPA in bouts of at least 5 minutes, MVPA in bouts of ≥10 minutes) on all-cause mortality over an average follow-up period of 6.6 years ( 38 ). In this analysis, the hazard ratios were similar across quartiles of MVPA regardless of bout duration, suggesting that the reduction in mortality risk is independent of how MVPA is accumulated. DISCUSSION Summary and Public Health Impact The 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans recommended that physical activity be accumulated in bouts of ≥10 minutes in duration to influence a variety of health-related outcomes ( 6 ). This was consistent with an initial paradigm shift that occurred approximately 20 years early when it was suggested by the CDC and ACSM that physical activity accumulated in bouts of ≥10 minutes in duration can improve a variety of health-related outcomes ( 4 ). This current review of the evidence continues to support that physical activity accumulated in bouts of ≥10 minutes in duration can improve a variety of health-related outcomes. However, additional evidence, from cross-sectional and prospective cohort studies, suggests that physical activity accumulated in bouts that are <10 minutes is also associated with favorable health-related outcomes, including all-cause mortality. This is of public health importance because it suggests that engaging in physical activity, regardless of length of the bout, may have health-enhancing effects. This is of particular importance for individuals who are unwilling or unable to engage in physical activity bouts that are ≥10 minutes in duration. It also adds support to public health initiatives advocating physical activity behaviors that are unlikely to require 10 minutes, such as climbing a flight of stairs or parking the car in a more distant part of the parking lot. This may suggest the need for a contemporary paradigm shift in public health recommendations for physical activity, which encourages engagement in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity as an important lifestyle behavior to enhance health, with potential benefits realized regardless of the bout duration. Needs for Future Research The evidence from this review supports that physical activity accumulated in bouts <10 minutes in duration are associated with enhanced health across a variety of outcomes. There is, however, a need for additional research related to the accumulation of physical activity and it association with health. These additional research needs are described below. Conduct longitudinal research, either in the form of prospective studies or randomized controlled trials, to examine whether physical activity accumulated in bouts of <10 minutes in duration enhances health outcomes. The majority of studies reviewed that support the health benefits of physical activity accumulated in bouts of <10 minutes in duration used a cross-sectional design, with none of the randomized studies reporting on the effects of physical activity accumulated in bouts of <10 minutes. Having this knowledge will inform potential cause and effect rather than simply associations. Conduct research to compare bouts of physical activity of <10 minutes to ≥10 minutes, which also equates for volume and total energy expenditure between these physical activity patterns, to examine the effects on health outcomes. The randomized studies that were specifically designed to equate for volume of physical activity or energy expenditure only examined the effects of physical activity performed in bouts ≥10 minutes. Thus, appropriately designed studies are needed to confirm the findings of the cross-sectional and prospective observational studies regarding the health benefits of physical activity accumulated in bouts ≥10 minutes in duration. Conduct large research trials with ample sample sizes to allow for stratum-specific analyses to determine whether the influence of physical activity accumulated in bouts of varying length on health outcomes varies by age, sex, race/ethnicity, socio-economic status, initial weight status, or other demographic characteristics. Based on the studies reviewed, there is limited evidence available on whether the influence of physical activity varies when the exposure to physical activity is consistent across individuals with different demographic characteristics. Having this information will inform public health recommendations about whether physical activity exposure of varying bout length to enhance health needs to vary by age, sex, race/ethnicity, socio-economic status, weight status and other demographic characteristics, and may allow for more precise individual-level physical activity recommendations. Include measurement methods in prospective and randomized studies that will allow for the evaluation of whether physical activity performed in a variety of bout lengths has differential effects on health outcomes. Based on this review, randomized studies were not identified that reported on physical activity accumulated in bouts that were <10 minutes in duration, and only three prospective studies were identified that reported on physical activity accumulated in bouts that were <10 minutes. This may be a result of the methods used to assess physical activity in randomized and prospective studies, suggesting the need to include physical activity assessment methods that allow for these data to be available for analysis. For example, the use of objective monitoring that allows for physical activity data to be collected in 1-minute epochs may be preferable to self-reported methods when examining the duration of activity bouts that are associated with improved health. Conduct meta-analyses and systematic reviews of longitudinal prospective studies to evaluate the effect of physical activity accumulated in varying bout durations on health outcomes. High-quality systematic reviews and meta-analyses were not identified in the literature that have summarized the evidence related to physical activity accumulated in varying bout durations and health outcomes. With specific regard to a summary of the evidence related to physical activity bout durations of <10 minutes, this may have been influenced by the current lack of sufficient prospective and randomized studies. This resulted in the need to examine limited number of individual studies that addressed this topic. As additional prospective and randomized studies are conducted on this topic, meta-analyses and systematic reviews should be conducted that will provide information on the consistency and magnitude of the overall effect size of the relationships observed across the original studies. Conduct appropriately designed studies to examine the mechanistic pathways by which physical activity bouts of varying durations, particularly bouts of physical activity <10 minutes in duration, may influence various health-related outcomes. This review of the literature was not designed to identify and summarize the scientific literature related to the potential mechanistic pathways of how physical activity bouts of varying durations, particularly <10 minutes in duration, may influence health-related measures. This may be important for understanding the biology of physical activity, provide a foundation for future research, and may influence for whom physical activity bouts <10 minutes in duration may be most effective. Conduct studies to examine the effects of light-intensity physical activity accumulated in bouts of <10 minutes and ≥10 minutes on health outcomes. The studies reviewed primarily focused on MVPA within the context of physical activity bout duration. Thus, these studies do not contribute to an understanding of how light-intensity physical activity may influence health outcomes, and whether bout duration of light-intensity physical activity may influence this potential relationship. This is a potentially important public health question given the potential for lifestyle, household, and occupational activity to be performed in bouts <10 minutes and at a light-intensity.

Pescatello PhD, FACSM 1 2627 Accesses 1 Altmetric Explore all metrics Abstract Despite the pervasiveness of hypertension (HTN), the exercise dose needed to lower blood pressure (BP) remains to be quantified. The purpose of this manuscript is to discuss recent advances in exercise prescription (ExR x ) for HTN. The take-home message in ExR x for those with HTN is that the antihypertensive effect is: immediate; elicited by low intensity, short-duration aerobic exercise; one of many health benefits; and individually tailored. With this message and the general rules of ExR x as a guide, those with HTN should exercise on most, preferably all, days of the week, with moderate intensity (40% to <60% of VO 2 Reserve), for 30 minutes or more of continuous or accumulated physical activity per day, primarily of the endurance type, supplemented by resistance exercise. Additionally, those who are overweight should progress to a caloric energy expenditure of a minimum of 1000 kcal to more than 2000 kcal per week or more than 2.5 hours per week of moderate-intensity, aerobic exercise.

Button Text \u200d Through the many technological advancements of the 21st century and the post-pandemic boom of working from home, it has become easier to lead a sedentary lifestyle. Long hours sitting at desks, doom scrolling on our phones, and using apps for everyday tasks have created a culture of inactivity. A study performed in 2020 found that 31% of the global population over 15 years old engages in insufficient physical activity, with a total of 7.7 hours spent per day being sedentary. This lack of movement has significant implications on our physical and mental health, contributing to issues like obesity, cardiovascular disease, chronic fatigue, and even anxiety and depression. As the evidence linking sedentary behavior to chronic disease continues to grow, the need for a more active lifestyle has never been more apparent. Moving regularly improves overall well-being by enhancing energy levels, boosting mood, and reducing the risk of life-altering diseases. 1, 2, 3 \u200d If you find yourself stuck in sedentary routines and unsure how to become more active, then the first step is to read this article. Designed with beginners in mind, it offers practical advice for overcoming common barriers like lack of time or motivation, creating a balanced fitness routine, and building sustainable habits that adapt over time. Whether you're completely new to exercise or looking for a manageable way to reintroduce activity after a long break , this step-by-step guide will help you transition from sedentary to active in a way that feels achievable, exciting, and rewarding within the new year. Make 2025 your most active year yet! Step 1: Understanding Your Current Activity Level And Setting Goals \u200d Before embarking on a fitness journey, you must understand where you’re starting from to set realistic goals and avoid unnecessary setbacks. Reflect on your current daily habits to identify patterns of inactivity. For example, are you spending most of your day sitting at a desk, lounging on the couch, or driving instead of walking? How often do you engage in physical activities like walking, stretching, or taking the stairs? Tracking your activity for a few days using a journal or fitness app can clearly show how much movement is currently part of your life. This is called your daily activity level, and the awareness helps you recognize how to easily incorporate new and more activity.Based on your current level of activity, create a few SMART goals - Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-based - to help you stay motivated and build confidence during the process. Instead of vaguely deciding to “exercise more,” a SMART goal would be: “Walk for 20 minutes, three times a week, for the next month.” This goal is specific (walking for a set time), measurable (20 minutes, three times a week), achievable (a realistic target for most beginners), relevant (a broader goal of increasing activity), and time-bound (one month). Breaking down goals into smaller, manageable steps ensures you don’t feel overwhelmed and can celebrate progress. For instance, if your long-term goal is to run a 5K, a SMART goal might be to start jogging for one minute and walking for four minutes three days a week. Over time, as you build strength and endurance, you can adjust your goals to keep challenging yourself and ultimately reach the 5K distance. SMART goals provide a roadmap to success while helping you stay consistent, which is the most critical factor in creating any sustainable fitness routine. Step 2: Recognizing Common Barriers and Overcoming Them \u200d Starting and maintaining a fitness routine can be challenging, especially when faced with common barriers such as time, motivation, or fear. Understanding these obstacles and finding strategies to overcome them can make all the difference in building a sustainable habit. Here are a few common barriers to be aware of: Time Constraints : Busy schedules often make it feel like there’s no time for exercise during the day. However, even short bouts of movement add up to provide health-improving benefits. Start with incorporating short workouts into your day, such as 10-minute walks, 5-10 minute bodyweight exercises, 10-minute stretching breaks, etc. These are called “exercise snacks” and research shows doing multiple exercise snacks in a single day can improve cardiometabolic health . 4 Lack of Motivation : Motivation can be elusive, especially when starting a new habit. Focus on finding your “why.” Whether it’s improving your health, having more energy for your family, or feeling stronger for everyday tasks, connecting your fitness routine to personal values makes it much more meaningful. You can also plan for small celebrations when you reach your goals or consider joining a class or group where shared energy and accountability can boost motivation. Fear of Judgment or Intimidation : Walking into a gym or fitness class as a beginner can feel overwhelming, especially if you’re unsure of what to do. Start with at-home workouts or online programs designed for beginners to build confidence in a private, pressure-free environment. Then, when you’re ready to step into a more public setting, remind yourself that everyone started somewhere, and most people are focused on their own workout anyway. Start with beginner-friendly classes or simple gym workouts to help you feel self-assured. Expensive Memberships and Equipment : The perception that being fit and active requires expensive gym memberships or equipment can discourage people from starting. Take advantage of free resources like YouTube workouts, apps with free basic plans, or outdoor activities such as walking, running, or cycling. Investing in simple, cost-effective equipment like resistance bands or a yoga mat can also provide variety without breaking the bank. Physical Limitations or Injuries : Health conditions, chronic pain, or previous injuries can make starting a fitness routine seem daunting. Despite how it may feel, being more active typically positively affects chronic pain and resolves many injuries. Consult a healthcare professional or physical therapist to develop a safe exercise plan tailored to your abilities. Start with low-impact activities like swimming, yoga, or stationary cycling, and add resistance training to improve mobility and strength without strain. 5 Step 3: Building a Fitness Foundation \u200d As you begin to build a foundation of fitness, it’s essential to prioritize safety and gradual progress to prevent injuries and form a sustainable habit. Low-impact activities such as walking, yoga, or light stretching are great for beginners to help ease your body into movement. Gradually increase the intensity or duration of your workouts over time - roughly every 6-8 weeks -\xa0 to allow your muscles, joints, and cardiovascular system to adapt. Avoid the temptation to overexert yourself too soon , as this can lead to burnout or injury. Remember, fitness is a marathon, not a sprint—progressing slowly and steadily is the key to long-term success.Don’t forget the power of consistency. Showing up for your workouts is far more important than the intensity in the early stages of building a fitness routine. Committing to small, manageable steps, such as 10 minutes of activity per day, can help you develop a sense of accomplishment and make exercise a non-negotiable part of your day. Another strategy that boosts consistency is habit stacking, which links a new fitness habit to an existing routine. For example, you might do a set of calf raises or bodyweight squats while brushing your teeth in the morning, take a short walk during your lunch break, or do a few lunges while waiting for the coffee to brew. These small, consistent actions can reinforce your commitment to fitness while laying the groundwork for more challenging routines as your confidence and strength grow. 6 Also Read: How Much to Exercise Weekly Based on Your Goals .

5 Time-Saving & Effective Micro Workouts For Men,"['H Smith', 'NPESC Trainer']",NA,5 Time-Saving & Effective Micro Workouts For Men,0,https://www.fitfatherproject.com/micro-workouts-for-men/,"{'Title': '5 Time-Saving & Effective Micro Workouts For Men', 'Authors': 'No Authors Found', 'Abstract': 'No Abstract Found', 'DOI': 'No DOI Found', 'Keywords': 'No Keywords Found', 'Full Text Content': ""5 Time-Saving & Effective Micro Workouts For Men Skip to content Exercise Fact Checked 5 Time-Saving & Effective Micro Workouts For Men Holly Smith, M.D., B.S. Dietetics, NASM-PES\xa0Certified Trainer Writer, Fit Father Project Holly Smith, M.D., B.S. Dietetics, NASM-PES\xa0Certified Trainer Writer, Fit Father Project B etween work, kids, and tons of other responsibilities, there are some days that it can seem impossible to fit in a workout. That's where micro workouts come into play. If you haven’t heard of micro workouts, it’s exactly what it sounds like. Micro workouts are short bouts of exercise that you can perform throughout the day when you have a few minutes of free time. And there is research to show that micro workouts can still have great fitness benefits. Improve Your Health with Short Bursts of Exercise A recent study from the Journal of the American Heart Association showed that sporadic exercise lasting 5-10 minutes performed throughout the day can help reduce mortality. While the AHA recommends 150 minutes each week of moderate to vigorous activity, the research found that this total was independent of how the activity was accumulated ( 1 ). Micro workouts are great because they can be done just about anywhere. The important thing to remember is that, since these workouts are short in duration, they need to be high in intensity. One study out of McMaster University in Ontario found that brief, intense exercise can improve cardiovascular health to the same extent as sustained endurance exercise. This was despite having lower total exercise volume! ( 2 ) So even a short workout, like our 24-minute fat-burner, is far better than no workout at all. Here’s A Free 24-Min Fat Burn Workout For Busy Men 40+ This powerful workout will reignite your metabolism to burn fat 24/7 like you did in your 20s… Download this Free Workout here. It’s safe, time-efficient, & designed exclusively for busy guys 40+\xa0» Increase Your Intensity With Micro Workouts For Men Any workout is going to burn calories, however the higher the intensity of the workout, the more calories you will continue to burn, even after the workout has ended. This is called Excess Post-Exercise Oxygen Consumption, or EPOC for short. So if you are short on time, the key is to really up the intensity. This ensures that even a workout that is low in minutes will be high in fat burning and strength building. For example, a study out of the International Journal of Sports Nutrition and Exercise Metabolism showed that two minutes of sprint intervals produced similar post-exercise oxygen consumption as thirty minutes of continuous running at a lower intensity ( 3 ). Form Still Counts, Even with Shorter Workouts And, just because you aren’t spending hours in a gym or using a lot of equipment, this does not mean you should forget about form and safety. Since you will be working at a higher intensity in these micro workouts, maintaining proper form throughout the movements is essential to avoid injury. Top 5 Micro Workouts For Men 1) Commercial Break Micro Workout Some days you can’t get to the gym, whether it be a long workday or needing to be at home with your kids. So here are some great moves to do in the comfort of your home. Jog in place for 30 seconds. This can start out as a light jog at first, then increase the pace. Burpees for 30 seconds . You can do these with or without a push-up. Remember to keep your core engaged throughout the movement. Alternating lunges for 30 seconds . Start out slowly and then gradually increase the intensity. Be sure that your knees don’t track over your feet during each movement. Elbow plank for 30 seconds. Don’t let your back arch while holding this position. If you feel your form fading, come out of the plank for a brief second and then resume. Rest for 1 minute, then repeat two more times. Try to increase the intensity or reps for each movement in each subsequent circuit. This short workout will give you both cardiovascular and strength training benefits. Try to move right from one exercise to the next to keep your heart rate up throughout this micro workout. 2) Micro Workouts for the Office You can still get a workout by accumulating reps throughout the day… even at your desk! Try these exercises at work whenever you get a chance to sneak in a few reps. Resistance training using your own bodyweight is a great way for men to add strength training through micro workouts even when you don’t have access to free weights. Tricep Chair dips x 30 reps: This is a quick exercise you can do whenever you have a couple of minutes. Just move to the edge of your chair and lower your body down into a tricep dip until your arms are parallel to the ground. Push back up, being sure to keep your arms close to your body. Bodyweight squats x 15 reps: Bodyweight squats are an easy exercise to do right beside your desk. Be sure that your knees don’t track over your feet. Engage your core and maintain good posture throughout to avoid injury. Push-Ups x 15 reps: Push-ups are a great upper body and core workout. These can be done just about anywhere, and there are a number of variations that can be done throughout the day. You can start out with standard push-ups. The next time you can do military push-ups, or put your feet up on your chair and try decline push-ups. This will allow you to engage different muscles in your chest. Calf raises x 30 reps: Stand next to your chair or desk and perform 30 reps of calf raises. Try changing the angle with this exercise as well. Do 30 reps with your toes pointing forward. Then try the next 30 reps with your toes pointed out, and finally, do another set with your toes pointing in to target all areas of your calf muscles. Repeat throughout the day when you have breaks between meetings and phone calls. This is a great way to get your blood flowing during the day, especially if you have a desk job that has you sitting most of the day. 3) Dumbbell Micro Workouts If you have access to a pair of dumbbells these can be used to get a killer micro workout from just about anywhere. Perform each exercise for 30 seconds, then move to the next. Rest for one minute, then repeat 1-2 times depending on how much time you have. Bicep curls Tricep kickbacks Shoulder press Lawnmower rows Squats Resistance workouts with weights has been found to help reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, even at less than an hour total for the week ( 4 ). If you have a pair of dumbbells around the house, these are some great exercises to sneak into your day whenever you have a few minutes. 4) Quick Tabata Micro Workout Make sure you have a towel and water available for this short, but intense micro workout. High-intensity interval training has been shown to produce similar calorie-burning potentials over 24 hours compared to longer bouts of lower intensity endurance exercise. This is despite being much shorter in duration ( 5 ). Burpees with push up for 20 seconds, rest 10 seconds Tuck jumps for 20 seconds, rest 10 seconds Mountain climbers for 20 seconds, rest 10 seconds Spiderman push-ups for 20 seconds, rest 10 seconds Repeat the circuit twice for a quick 4-minute Tabata style workout. If you have extra time you can add on another circuit. 5) Hotel Stairs Micro Workout Stuck on the road and still want to fit in a short workout? If your hotel doesn’t have a gym, hit the stairs! You can modify this micro workout based on how many flights of stairs you have available. Sprint up one flight of stairs, walk or jog back down Next, sprint up two flights of stairs, walk or jog back down Finally, sprint up three flights of stairs, walk or jog back down Repeat two times through for a quick and efficient cardio workout that will also build up your glutes, quads, and hamstrings. If you can do this 3 or 4 times throughout the day, that’s even better! A 2019 study published in Applied Physiology, Nutrition, and Metabolism found that three bouts a day of vigorous stair workouts done three times a week were highly effective at improving cardiovascular health ( 6 ). When You Can’t Get A Full Workout, Micro Workout! Micro workouts are a great way to get your heart rate up and fit in a quick workout. While they don’t take the place of more structured workouts throughout the week, micro workouts are far better than doing nothing at all. The Fit Father Project is a great place to find a variety of exercise options. This ranges from month-long programs to quick micro workouts for men like those listed above. For example, this awesome 7-minute workout which is another great high-intensity micro workout you can do on days when you are short on time. As a busy dad, life can get hectic, but just because you are completely swamped doesn’t mean that you have to miss out on being active. Micro workouts are an efficient way for men to get their muscles moving and heart pumping on days when you otherwise would have done nothing. I hope this gives you something to think about?

While some hacks border on the bizarre and often ridiculous, others are grounded in science and offer legitimate benefits when applied in a holistic approach to a healthy lifestyle. READ MORE | 5 Hacks To Boost Strength In The Gym While these tips are not quick-fixes, these 5 hacks could possibly boost your results or help you derive more benefits from your diet and exercise regimen. 1. Include protein in every meal When it comes to healthful eating or dieting, most people fixate on the carbohydrates or fats in their diet. While many people understand how important protein is to the muscle-building and repair processes, there are other potential benefits from this important macronutrient. For starters, protein is more satiating than carbohydrates . That means you can eat less and still feel full and satisfied 1 . Importantly, adding protein to carbohydrate reduces the glycaemic response by delaying gastric emptying and stimulating insulin secretion 2 . These effects have numerous possible implications for our health and nutrition, such as supporting the role of high protein diets to help manage diabetes 2 by lowering the glycaemic load of meals. Increasing your muscle mass, which requires adequate protein, can also help you lose or maintain your weight by increasing your resting metabolic rate. 2. Go cold turkey on sugar Added and processed sugar is highly addictive and can damage our health and body in numerous ways when consumed in excess. For instance, an excessive sugar intake is linked to conditions such as obesity, chronic systemic inflammation, hormonal imbalances, metabolic syndrome, various cancers, numerous cognitive diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease, high cholesterol and fatty liver disease 3 . Thankfully, it seems you can start to reverse the negative effects of sugar consumption relatively quickly . For instance, a study 4 found that a 12-week intervention focused on decreasing added sugar intake had “the potential to reduce type 2 diabetes risk in overweight youth”. Other short-term benefits reported by people who quit sugar include better sleep and more stable energy levels throughout the day, enhanced cognitive function and reduced brain fog, and better skin health . To cut sugar from your diet, stop adding sugar to your food and beverages or during the cooking process, cut out all sugar-sweetened drinks and read food labels to determine how much sugar is in the packaged and manufactured foods you buy, then buy options with lower sugar contents or sugar-free options. 3. Move more and more often The key to staying healthy is to rethink the idea of exercise . In addition to a designated workout slot, aim to get active as often as you can, including during down time. For example, consider turning off the TV and going for a walk around the block to relax. Making movement part of your daily routine is an easy yet effective way to boost your fitness, metabolism and overall health. According to Dr James Levine, everyday activities that are unrelated to exercise can burn an extra 2,000 calories a day when comparing people of similar sizes 5 . Dr Levine defined this phenomenon as non-exercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT) and continues to study it. Also known as non-exercise physical activity (NEPA), NEAT is a measure of the calories (energy) you burn simply living your life . While these are usually classified as incidental activities that happen as part of the normal course of daily life, introducing more of them into your day as intentional activities can help to boost your metabolism. Research suggests that burning more calories throughout the day and eating more food but remaining in a slight calorie deficit is a more effective way to lose weight . A study 6 on the phenomenon – known as high energy flux – explained that: “Maintaining energy balance at a higher caloric intake and expenditure should be a more successful long-term strategy for weight maintenance than reduced consumption or extreme caloric restriction at a low level of energy expenditure.” In this regard, extended periods of low-grade activity is better at sustaining high calorie flux than short bouts of high-intensity exercise. 4. Multiple mini workouts If your office job and daily schedule are too busy to keep moving around to boost your NEAT, try micro workouts . These short bouts of easy activity or intense exercise performed periodically throughout the day, rather than in a single session, can also deliver health and fitness benefits. Options range from a few reps between meetings or power-walking up the stairs at the office to two-, three- or 10-minute interval sessions incorporating 2-3 compound exercises before and after work and over lunch. A growing body of research suggests that micro workouts can certainly deliver benefits. For example, a study 7 published in 2022 determined that performing short ‘exercise snacks’ every day, rather than longer exercise sessions, was enough to improve metabolic health. Another study 8 determined that 20-second bursts of intense stair climbing offered “a practical, time-efficient strategy” to boost fitness levels and improve cardiorespiratory function (in previously untrained women). The key is to vary the intensity and the total volume and frequency of these exercise snacks throughout the day. 5. Trick your hunger For many people, sticking to a diet is the hardest part of a body or lifestyle transformation, particularly due to the hunger that accompanies a reduced calorie intake. You can make this a less daunting task with simple diet hacks that help you suppress your appetite . Adding an appetite suppressant supplement like like Biogen Appetite Suppress or NPL Appetite Control can help to temporarily dull your hunger and increase the feeling of fullness. You can also try one of the oldest hacks in the book – drinking a glass of water before a meal . A study 9 confirmed that drinking water before eating reduced the amount of food consumed. These results prompted researchers to conclude that pre-meal water consumption “may be an effective weight control strategy”. Another study 10 showed that drinking 568 ml of water before a meal decreased calorie intake and hunger while increasing fullness and satisfaction. References Pontzer H, Yamada Y, Sagayama H, et al.

The timing of food choice—choosing for immediate or later consumption—has been found to influence the healthfulness of foods consumed. To examine both of these effects, we tested in our study whether the timing of food choice interacts with exposure to exercise to impact food choices such that choices would differ when made prior to or following an exercise bout. Visitors to a university recreational center were equipped with an accelerometer prior to their habitual workout regime, masking the true study purpose. As a reward, participants were presented with a snack for consumption after workout completion. Participants made their snack choice from either an apple or chocolate brownie after being pseudo-randomly assigned to choose prior to (“before”) or following workout completion (“after”). Complete data were available for 256 participants (54.7% male, 22.1 ± 3.1 years, 24.7 ± 3.7 kg/m 2 ) who exercised 65.3 ± 22.5 min/session. When compared with “before,” the choice of an apple decreased (73.7% vs. 54.6%) and the choices of brownie (13.9% vs. 20.2%) or no snack (12.4% vs. 25.2%) increased in the “after” condition (χ 2 = 26.578, p < 0.001). Our results provide support for both compensatory eating and exercise-induced anorexia. More importantly, our findings suggest that the choice of food for post-exercise consumption can be altered through a simple behavioral intervention. Keywords: compensatory eating ; exercise-induced anorexia ; food choice ; acute exercise ; behavioral economics ; nudges 1. Introduction Regular exercise and a healthy diet are important staples of a healthy lifestyle. The beneficial effects of exercise for the treatment and prevention of many physiological and psychological conditions, including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, certain cancers, recovery from stroke, emotional well-being, depression, anxiety, and suicidal behaviors [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 ], are well documented. However, the impact of exercise on overweight and obesity, and particularly its ability to produce meaningful weight loss remains under debate [ 9 ]. It is undisputed that exercise increases energy expenditure and thereby has the potential to induce weight loss. However, individual weight loss responses are mixed [ 10 ], suggesting that the success of exercise as a weight loss strategy is largely dependent on its effects on the other component of energy balance, i.e., dietary energy intake. A primary barrier to exercise-induced weight loss is compensatory eating, which is defined as an increase in food intake following exercise or physical activity [ 11 ]. It is a common belief that exercise stimulates appetite and food intake [ 12 ], and as much as 77% of college students report engaging in compensatory eating [ 11 , 13 ]. The mechanisms for this compensatory increase in food intake following exercise are manifold, but most likely include endocrine pathways that favor food intake to ensure the maintenance of body weight, and more specifically lean body mass [ 14 , 15 ]. On the other hand, there is also evidence in the literature contrary to compensation. Evidence shows that only 19% of intervention studies reported an increase in energy intake after exercise, whereas 65% show no change [ 16 ]. Furthermore, it has repeatedly been demonstrated that appetite and hunger are suppressed following exercise, particularly in the immediate post-exercise state [ 12 ]. This reduction in perceived hunger has been termed “exercise-induced anorexia” and has been linked to the suppression of orexigenic hormones, such as ghrelin, and concomitant increases in satiety hormones, including peptide YY and glucagon-like peptide 1 [ 17 , 18 , 19 ]. While the impact of exercise on energy intake is important from an energy balance perspective, it is critical to understand that energy intake is ultimately the product of food choices, as individuals select foods rather than nutrients under free-living conditions [ 12 ]. It has been proposed that exercise participation can impact food selection, modify the sensitivity to sensory cues [ 12 ], and alter the reward value of foods with particular sensory and/or macronutrient profiles [ 20 , 21 ]. Hedonic mechanisms controlling food intake are stimulated by the sensory pleasure of eating palatable food and may result in increased food intake [ 22 ]. This increase in food intake has been linked to the neuroendocrine factor dopamine, which has been shown to reinforce the pleasure derived from eating highly palatable foods [ 23 , 24 ]. Exercise has been found to reduce addictive behaviors such as drug and alcohol consumption [ 23 ], and as such it is possible that exercise may also elicit a reduction in food intake as a result of the rewarding value of food. Previous experiments have shown that the responsiveness of brain regions related to food reward is altered in the post-exercise state [ 25 ], such that the brain’s neural reward system’s response to low energy density foods is increased and the reaction to high energy density is reduced [ 26 , 27 , 28 ]. In support of the contradictory findings in the literature, it has been proposed that exercise could either increase or decrease the reinforcing value of energy-dense, palatable foods. For example, the deliberate choice of highly palatable, energy-dense foods (e.g., fatty and/or sweet “treats”) in the post-exercise state has been linked to compensatory eating and reduced weight loss success [ 21 ]. Others have reported that carbohydrate-rich foods are rated more palatable in the post-exercise state [ 25 , 26 ], possibly reflecting increased carbohydrate utilization during aerobic exercise [ 29 ]. Alternatively, exercise could also reduce the consumption of these foods as a result of improved appetite control coupled with a higher motivation to engage in healthy behaviors [ 28 ]. These diametrically opposed effects of exercise on food choices could ultimately explain the inter-individual variation in the degree of compensatory eating following exercise interventions [ 21 ]. Another important influence on dietary quality is the timing of food choice relative to consumption. Prior research from behavioral economics and psychology suggests that changing the timing of food choice relative to consumption—whether food choices will be consumed immediately or at some later point—influences the healthfulness of the foods chosen [ 30 , 31 ]. Behavioral economic models of choices over time (the most prominent of which is hyperbolic discounting [ 32 ]) have been formulated to represent individuals who have inconsistent preferences. These models predict that choices will differ depending on whether the chosen item is to be received immediately or after a delay. When the decision-maker will receive their choice immediately, the models predict that the individual will make less healthy, more impatient decisions than if the receipt is delayed. Individuals whose choices fit this pattern are said to have “present-biased preferences.” An upshot of present-biased preferences is that people will often be willing to pre-commit to a healthier behavior if given the opportunity to do so [ 33 , 34 ]. To integrate the impact of biophysical and behavioral effects on post-exercise food intake in a real-life scenario, the overall goal of the present study was to test whether manipulating the timing of the choice of a snack to be received after exposure to exercise would alter food choices such that in the post-exercise state the choice of snacks with varying energy density and health attributes would differ from choices made prior to exercise. Our intervention addresses a simple but important question: Can a simple nudge—changing the time when the choice of a post-exercise snack is made—help individuals select healthier food options? Given the importance of understanding why people make unhealthy dietary choices and how these choices can be discouraged [ 35 ], examining how factors such as the timing of food choice that may promote healthy eating in the context of exercising would be beneficial [ 28 ]. This is particularly true since behavioral weight loss strategies typically employ a combination of diet and/or exercise. However, as mentioned previously, evidence suggests that increases in food consumption in response to exercise can derail weight loss efforts [ 16 ]. Knowledge about the degree to which food choices are altered from pre- to post-exercise could ultimately allow individuals to pre-commit to healthier food choices by selecting food in a state which favors their choice of healthier options. Our primary hypothesis was that individuals are more likely to choose an “unhealthy,” energy-dense snack in the post-exercise state when compared to choosing a snack for post-exercise consumption prior to exercising, supporting previous evidence of compensatory eating [ 11 ] as well as findings from behavioral studies of food choice [ 30 ]. To also account for previously reported reductions in appetite and hunger in the immediate post-exercise state, we further hypothesized that the number of participants who would decline a snack would also increase in the post-exercise state. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Study Design The experiment was conducted at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln Recreational and Wellness Center and was focused on the effect of the timing of food choice—which was assigned by the researchers to take place before or after the participant exercised—on selection of a food item. The food item was received after the exercise was completed in both conditions. The experiment took place on randomly chosen weekdays between February 16 and April 30, 2018, and implementation of conditions was balanced across the study period and days of the week. Individuals were recruited to participate as they entered the recreational center. All participants had to be at least 19 years of age and to have come to the Recreational and Wellness Center to exercise. When individuals were invited to participate, the purpose of the study was presented as being focused on calibrating activity sensors to various exercise types. As an incentive for participation in this “calibration study,” participants were offered a choice of food items upon completion of the study. In actuality, participants’ choice of a food item was of central interest to the study, but this interest in participants’ food choices was not highlighted to minimize experimenter demand effects [ 36 ] and social desirability biases [ 37 , 38 ]. Participants signed a written informed consent form prior to the experiment. The study was approved by the University of Nebraska-Lincoln Institutional Review Board. 2.2. Procedures After participants signed the informed consent form, study staff measured their height and weight on a digital column scale (Seca, Hamburg, Germany). Next, participants were fitted with an accelerometer (GT3X, ActiGraph, Pensacola, FL, USA) on their non-dominant wrist, which they wore for the duration of their workout. Study staff instructed all participants to proceed with the workout that the participant had planned to complete at the Recreation and Wellness Center prior to study recruitment. When subjects returned the accelerometers upon completion of their workout, additional information was collected, including each participant’s date of birth, the type of activity or activities conducted during the workout, and whether participants ate or drank anything during the workout. Participants were told that this information was needed to personalize the accelerometer data. 2.3. Food Choice Paradigm In order to examine changes in food choices over the course of a self-selected workout, participants were given a snack choice to be received upon completion of their workout as a reward for study participation. In one condition, prior to beginning their workout (“before”), participants were asked to choose which snack item they wanted to receive. Upon completion of their workout and them returning the accelerometer, participants were given the food item they had selected. In the other condition (“after”), participants were asked to choose their snack right as they came back to return their accelerometer after their workout. In the “after” condition, participants received their snack immediately after making their choice. For logistical purposes, one condition (“before” or “after”) was implemented per study day. In order to present two snack options with distinguishable perceived health attributes but similar taste attributes (sweet), participants were able to choose between an apple (deemed “healthy”) and a brownie (deemed “unhealthy”). Participants also had the option to decline both snacks (“neither”). Both snack options were visible to participants as they checked in (“before” condition) or as they checked out (“after” condition). Prior to giving the chosen snack to the participant, study staff inquired about food allergies and intolerances. All food used in the experiment was purchased and prepared in a large batch by a food and beverage management specialist in a department certified kitchen and stored at appropriate conditions (temperature checks were performed twice per day) prior to presenting it to study participants. The apple variety offered in the study was Fuji with an average energy content of 121 kcal per medium-sized apple [ 39 ]. Brownies were prepared from a prepackaged commercial brownie mix (Ghiradelli, San Leandro, CA, USA) and had an energy content of 140 kcal per piece. 2.4. Data Analyses Data were analyzed using R Statistical Software (R Core Team, R Foundation, Vienna, Austria). Prior to data analysis, data from individuals who participated in the study multiple times were eliminated from the dataset such that only the first study visit was included in the analyses. In addition, data from participants who reported food allergies or intolerances that could have affected the food choice were eliminated from the dataset. Participants’ food item choices were analyzed to evaluate whether the proportion of choices of the different food items (including “neither”) differed by condition using a chi-squared test. We then used multinomial, multivariate logistic regression models to examine the relationship between food choice and condition while controlling for potentially confounding variables comprising body mass index (BMI) category (≤25 kg/m 2 ; >25 kg/m 2 ), age (in years), gender, workout duration (in minutes), whether the participant consumed any food during their workout, and mode of exercise (aerobic, resistance, and other). BMI categories were aggregated from four initial categories (underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obese) into two (underweight/normal weight, and overweight/obese) because few participants fell into the underweight (3 participants) and obese (18 participants) categories. Results of the multinomial logistic regression models are presented as odds ratios (OR) and 95-percent confidence intervals (95% CI) for independent variables. Statistical significance was considered for p -values < 0.05. 3. Results A total of 299 data points were initially collected. Data from 31 participants (42 observations) were eliminated because individuals had participated in the study more than once. In addition, data from one participant who reported having celiac disease were omitted. The final dataset used for analysis contained observations from 256 unique participants. Of these, 137 participants (53.5%) completed the “before” condition and 119 completed the “after” condition (46.5%). On average, 54.7% of participants were male, 22.1 ± 3.1 years old, had an average BMI of 24.7 ± 3.7 kg/m 2 , and exercised for 65.3 ± 22.5 min. There were no significant differences between conditions in gender distribution, age, BMI or BMI categories, workout duration, food consumption, or mode of exercise ( Table 1 ). Table 1. Characteristics of the study sample. In the “before” condition, 101 participants (73.7%) selected an apple, 19 (13.9%) selected a brownie, and 17 (12.4%) declined a snack upon completion of their workout. In the “after” condition, 65 participants (54.6%) selected an apple, which is an ~20% decrease from the “before” condition. Twenty-four participants (20.2%) selected a brownie in the “after” condition, and 30 participants (25.2%) declined a snack option upon completion of their workout. The patterns of choices ( Figure 1 ) differed significantly between the “before” and “after” condition (χ-squared = 26.578, df = 2; p < 0.001). Figure 1. Proportion of snack choices (apple, brownie, or neither) for consumption after completion of a workout chosen either before the beginning of the workout (“before” condition) or after completion of the workout (“after” condition). Results from the multinomial, multivariate logistic regression model are reported in Table 2 . The omitted snack choice was “neither” in the regression model. Results confirm that the odds of a participant choosing an apple decreased significantly in the “after” condition relative to the choice of neither (OR: 0.33; 95% CI: 0.16–0.66), even after controlling for other variables. The estimated odds ratio for the effect of the “after” condition on apple choice remained unchanged regardless of other independent variables included in the regression model, including BMI status, age, gender, and workout duration. There were no significant differences in brownie choice (relative to choosing neither) based on condition (OR: 0.64; 95% CI: 0.26–1.55). In addition to the condition, only the BMI category significantly contributed to the regression model of snack choice. Individuals who were classified as overweight or obese (BMI > 25 kg/m 2 ) were significantly less likely to select a brownie than individuals with a BMI < 25 kg/m 2 (OR: 0.37; 95% CI: 0.15–0.92). Table 2. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) from multinomial logistic regression results of snack choice, relative to neither. 4. Discussion The goal of the present study was to assess whether the timing of snack choice would interact with exposure to a single exercise bout to alter food choices. Using a behavioral intervention approach, we show that a very simple modification—making a choice about a post-exercise snack either prior to or following the completion of the exercise bout—significantly alters the snack choice. Our findings indicate that the likelihood of choosing an apple, a food typically considered as “healthy”, is about one third (33.5%) greater when the choice is presented prior to engaging in exercise; however, when the choice is presented following the exercise bout, individuals are approximately 39% more likely to choose a brownie, a food typically considered as “unhealthy”, and 112% more likely to decline either snack option. These findings exhibit elements of two previously identified effects of exercise on food choice: compensatory eating, which refers to the increase in food intake following exercise of physical activity [ 11 ], and exercise-induced anorexia, which refers to a temporary reduction in appetite immediately following exercise [ 40 ]. They also correspond to patterns seen in previous behavioral research, in which individuals are more likely to make healthier choices if the food will be delivered in the future rather than immediately [ 30 ]. 4.1. Interindividual Variation in Post-Exercise Food Choices: Compensatory Eating and Exercise-Induced Anorexia The increase in the preference for a brownie, an energy-dense and palatable snack, can be seen as evidence for compensatory eating. Finlayson et al. speculated that hedonic processes are modulated by increased energy expended during exercise, thereby promoting overconsumption in individuals prone to compensatory eating [ 22 ]. Considering that a greater tendency for compensatory eating has been linked to attenuated weight loss during exercise interventions [ 21 ], our findings highlight the importance of timing of food choices for individuals who exercise to lose weight. In contrast, others have reported a reduced preference for energy-dense food following exercise. For example, an acute bout of resistance exercise decreased the preference for high-fat food [ 27 ], and 2 weeks of aerobic exercise were found to reduce the reinforcing value of high energy density foods [ 28 ]. However, it is noteworthy that there was a dose-dependent relationship between habitual exercise and the reduction in the reinforcing value of high energy density foods, which was most pronounced in individuals who exercised 5 days per week when compared to individuals who exercised less regularly [ 28 ]. In addition to an increased preference for an “unhealthy” option, we further observed an increase in the number of individuals who declined either food option among participants who were given a snack choice in the post-exercise state. While we acknowledge that there may be other reasons for this finding, this finding is in accordance with previous reports of exercise-induced anorexia. This phenomenon, which describes a transient reduction in appetite and hunger in the immediate post-exercise state, has been linked to reductions in ghrelin, an appetite-stimulating hormone, and increased concentrations of satiety hormones, including peptide YY and glucagon-like peptide 1 [ 17 , 18 , 19 , 41 ]. However, hunger is not necessarily indicative of actual food intake, as shown in a study involving exposure to exercise message commercials, which resulted in higher ratings of hunger but lower caloric intake [ 42 ]. Taken together, increases in compensatory eating and exercise-induced anorexia result in a greater inter-individual variability in post-exercise food intake. These competing effects, i.e., an increase in consumption of an “unhealthy” option along with a greater number of individuals declining either food option, negate an overall group effect. In fact, when determining the caloric intake based on food choices made (brownie, apple or neither), average caloric intake did not change dramatically from “before” (109 kcal/participant) to “after” (94 kcal/participant), which is in support of a previous meta-analysis by Schubert et al. who failed to identify a definite effect of an exercise task on post-exercise caloric intake [ 10 ]. This finding is also in agreement with observations from our laboratory, according to which inter-individual differences in food choices are greater in the post-exercise state when compared to the rested state (Koehler, unpublished observation). 4.2. Impact of Gender and Body Mass Index In contrast to previous studies, we failed to observe a significant gender effect in our food choice paradigm. Although most laboratory experiments addressing the impact of a single exercise bout on food intake were not specifically designed to detect gender differences, it is well established in the literature that food intake patterns differ between men and women and that women consistently make healthier choices than men [ 43 ]. Furthermore, the motivation to exercise tends to differ between genders, as women are more likely to exercise in attempts to lose weight [ 44 ]. As such, it is not surprising that when compared to their male counterparts, female athletes exhibit more self-control for high-calorie and sweet food options [ 45 ]. However, despite these gender differences, a recent meta-regression showed no impact of gender on post-exercise calorie intake [ 10 ], which is in agreement with the lack of a gender effect in our study. This lack of gender difference may be further explained by the fact that a greater proportion of our female participants conducted aerobic exercise (84% vs. 52% in males, p < 0.001), which is reflective of the general exercise motives of young adults [ 46 ]. It is possible that the lower energy expenditure of resistance exercise, when compared to aerobic exercise [ 47 ], reduced the likelihood of compensatory eating in the male participants. Furthermore, a recent study reported that resistance exercise, but not aerobic exercise, reduced explicit liking for high-fat food [ 27 ]. We did, however, find an effect of BMI on overall food choice, whereby individuals with a BMI indicative of overweight or obesity (> 25 kg/m 2 ) were less likely to choose our “unhealthy” option. This finding is contrary to previous literature suggesting that obesity is associated with an increased drive to eat palatable foods [ 48 ], specifically in the absence of hunger [ 49 ], and greater impulsivity toward food reward [ 50 ]. However, it should be noted that the current study was selectively conducted in individuals who voluntarily exercised, a group not necessarily representative of individuals who are overweight and obese [ 51 ]. As such, our overweight or obese participants may have exhibited a greater motivation to lose weight compared to non-exercising individuals [ 52 ]. Furthermore, it is also possible that our measure of BMI overestimated levels of overweight and obesity in our group of exercisers, as it is well known that BMI fails to differentiate between individuals with excess adiposity vs. individuals with increased muscle mass [ 53 ]. 4.3. Limitations As the study presents a simple behavioral manipulation in a real-life setting, there are various limitations to our investigation. First, we failed to assess changes in ratings of appetite or hunger over the course of the exercise bout as well as appetite-regulating peptides, and more specifically whether inter-individual differences in these outcomes would explain differences in food choices from pre- to post-exercise. However, as previously mentioned, it is well known that hunger levels alone fail to explain differences in the food intake response following exercise [ 22 ]. In order to test the impact of exercise on food choice in a real-life scenario, we chose to allow participants to follow their regular exercise regimen. As such, exercise intensity was self-selected and consequently varied among our participants. High-intensity exercise has been shown to favor a negative energy balance to a greater extent than low-intensity exercise [ 54 ]. Although each participant wore an accelerometer during their exercise bout, we chose not to include this data in the present analysis due to previous studies demonstrating that the Actigraph tends to perform poorly during vigorous activities [ 55 ], which we presumed to be the primary intensity range in the present study. Regardless, future studies should attempt to assess exercise intensity using objective (e.g., heart rate) or subjective (e.g., ratings of perceived exertion) measures. Another limitation was that we did not assess the prandial state, such as the time of the last meal or current hunger levels. While intriguing, these measures were not taken in order to avoid revealing the true purpose of this investigation. We did, however, assess food intake (in excess of water) during the workouts, but this variable did not have a significant effect on food choice as shown by our regression analysis ( Table 2 ). While future studies should more carefully monitor food intake and hunger levels prior to the experiment, we are confident that using a relatively large sample and conducting all experimental trials at the same time of day minimized the impact of the prandial state on our outcomes. Our findings clearly highlight that food choices change depending on whether a post-exercise snack is chosen prior to or following the exercise bout. Behavioral economic models of intertemporal choice provide another perspective on this pattern of choice [ 32 ]. Many people have inconsistent preferences for outcomes that occur at different time points relative to when the choice is made. While most of the evidence is for choices made over monetary outcomes, there is some evidence about food choice as well. When people make choices for foods that they will receive immediately, time-inconsistent preferences tend to lead them to be more indulgent—choosing less healthy foods—than if receipt of the selected food is in the future. This model predicts that people are more likely to make a healthy choice for their future self than they are for their current self [ 56 ]. While this phenomenon may have explained the increased preference for the “unhealthy” option (brownie) following the workout (immediately before the snack) compared to before the workout (on average 65 min before their snack), it fails to explain the increase in the number of participants who declined either snack. A second behavioral economic influence may shed light on increases in both unhealthy and neither food option: projection bias [ 57 ]. Projection bias refers to the failure of a decision-maker to correctly predict their preferences for outcomes that occur in the future. This bias is thought to be particularly likely to occur when the individual is making a choice in one state that will be experienced in another state [ 58 ]. It is well established that exercise induces changes in an individual’s state by, for instance, suppressing appetite-inducing hormones [ 17 , 18 , 19 , 41 ]. Future studies can feature more sophisticated designs that separately identify these various influences on decision-making, such as including non-exercising control activities to disentangle the effects of time-inconsistent preferences from compensatory eating and exercise-induced anorexia and varying the state in which participants make food choices for immediate and future receipt. 5. Conclusions Overall, our study demonstrates that the choice of a post-exercise snack can be shifted through a simple behavioral intervention, i.e., choosing the snack prior to or after the exercise bout. As such, our results provide support for both an increased preference for compensatory eating as well as an increased degree of exercise-induced anorexia. Our findings have important practical implications for individuals who are attempting to lose or control their weight through exercise, as well as for health professionals providing guidance and support to these individuals. Corroborating previous research [ 34 , 58 ], participants in this study who chose their snack before they exercised—the “before” condition—were more likely to select a healthier snack than participants who chose immediately prior to receipt of the snack (the “after” condition). A simple strategy such as encouraging individuals to make choices about foods that they will eat post-exercise prior to their workout may help those who are attempting to lose weight through diet and exercise pre-commit to healthier foods. Pre-commitment can prevent individuals from offsetting the gains in exercise-related caloric expenditure through compensatory eating.

Copy URL Share a link Share on Email Facebook x LinkedIn Reddit Wechat Abstract We hypothesized that exercise training would prevent gains in body weight and body fat, and worsening of cardiometabolic risk markers, during a 4-week period of indulgent food snacking in overweight/obese men. Twenty-eight physically inactive men (ages 19–47\xa0yr) with body mass index (BMI) ≥25\xa0kg/m 2 consumed 48 donuts (2/day, 6\xa0days/week; ~14,500\xa0kcal total) for 4\xa0weeks while maintaining habitual diet. Men were randomly assigned to control ( n =\xa09), moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT; n =\xa09), or high-intensity interval training (HIIT; n =\xa010). Exercise training occurred 4\xa0days/week, ~250\xa0kcal/session. Controls did not increase body weight, body fat, or visceral abdominal fat. This was partially explained by a decrease in self-reported habitual energy (−239\xa0kcal/day, p =\xa00.05) and carbohydrate (−47\xa0g/day; p =\xa00.02) intake. Large inter-individual variability in changes in body weight, fat, and fat-free mass was evident in all groups. Fasting blood pressure, and blood concentrations of glucose, insulin, and lipids were unchanged in all groups. Glucose incremental area under the curve during an oral glucose tolerance test was reduced by 25.6% in control ( p =\xa00.001) and 32.8% in MICT ( p =\xa00.01) groups. Flow-mediated dilation (FMD) was not changed in any group. VO 2max increased ( p ≤\xa00.001) in MICT (9.2%) and HIIT (12.1%) groups. We conclude that in physically inactive men with BMI ≥25\xa0kg/m 2 , consuming ~14,500\xa0kcal as donuts over 4\xa0weeks did not adversely affect body weight and body fat, or several markers of cardiometabolic risk. Consumption of the donuts may have prevented the expected improvement in FMD with HIIT. 1 INTRODUCTION Snacking has increased during the past 50\xa0years and may contribute to excess energy intake and adversely affect diet quality (Bellisle, 2014 ; Mattes, 2018 ). Thus, snacking may influence energy balance and markers of cardiometabolic health. Snack foods can vary considerably in nutrient and energy density, which can alter the impact of the snack on energy balance and health outcomes. Randomized controlled trials of snacking have shown that snacks such as fruits, vegetables, nuts, and cereal bars have little, if any, effect on body weight, body fat, or cardiometabolic risk markers (Claesson et al., 2009 ; Njike et al., 2017 ; Viskaal-van Dongen et al., 2010 ; Zaveri & Drummond, 2009 ). By contrast, indulgent snack foods consisting mostly of fat and sugar have been shown to increase body weight (Claesson et al., 2009 ; Mazlan et al., 2006 ; Njike et al., 2017 ), blood pressure (Njike et al., 2017 ), and fasting insulin concentration (Claesson et al., 2009 ). Positive energy balance in these studies may be due to the fact that the mandatory snacks were cookies and candy, which are ultra-processed foods that have been associated with increased overall dietary energy intake and weight gain (Hall et al., 2019 ). An important question is whether exercise can mitigate the deleterious effects of mandatory consumption of indulgent snack foods. In young men, exercise training has been reported to prevent weight gain during 1\xa0week of consuming 900\xa0kcal/day of sugar-sweetened beverages while otherwise maintaining normal dietary intake (Bock et al., 2020 ), and during 14\xa0days of consuming fast-food meals (three extra value meals/day + optional snack) as the sole source of energy intake (Duval et al., 2017 ). Also, a high level of physical activity (~11,000–12,500\xa0steps/day) has been shown to offset the deleterious effects of 14\xa0days of a high-fructose diet (Bidwell et al., 2014 ) or excess energy intake (Krogh-Madsen et al., 2014 ). However, these studies used subjects with a mean body mass index (BMI) <25\xa0kg/m 2 . In fact, most of the studies on snacking used subjects with BMI <30\xa0kg/m 2 (Mazlan et al., 2006 ; Tey et al., 2011 ; Viskaal-van Dongen et al., 2010 ). In two studies that recruited only participants with BMI ≥25\xa0kg/m 2 (Njike et al., 2017 ; Zaveri & Drummond, 2009 ), exercise was not included in the research design. Only one of these studies examined snack food options comprised of mostly fat and sugar (cookies), and the investigators reported significant increases in body weight, percent body fat, and systolic and diastolic blood pressures (Njike et al., 2017 ). Thus, the primary purpose of our study was to determine whether exercise training could offset the expected increases in body weight and body fat resulting from consumption of an indulgent snack food 6\xa0days per week for 4\xa0weeks in physically inactive men with a BMI ≥25\xa0kg/m 2 . Secondarily, we were interested in determining whether several indices of cardiometabolic health would be adversely affected by the indulgent snack food consumption, and if exercise training could prevent these from occurring. We chose donuts as our indulgent snack because they are highly palatable, consist of mostly fat and sugar, and are widely consumed (~10 billion donuts are consumed annually in the United States (DMR Business Statistics, 2021 ). We used both high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT) in order to compare the effectiveness of each type of training on mitigating the anticipated adverse effects of the donuts. We chose a 4-week intervention because this duration may have relevance for interpreting results of studies on holiday weight gain (Cook et al., 2012 ; Ramirez-Jimenez et al., 2020 ; Stevenson et al., 2013 ; Yanovski et al., 2000 ). For example, it was recently reported that during the Christmas holiday period, 3\xa0weeks of HIIT prevented weight gain and increases in blood pressure, fasting insulin concentration, and HOMA-IR in overweight and obese men with metabolic syndrome (Ramirez-Jimenez et al., 2020 ). We hypothesized that both exercise training protocols would result in significantly less gain in body weight and fat mass during the 4-week period of indulgent food snacking compared to a sedentary, control group, with no differences between exercise training groups. Based on limited published data, we also hypothesized that both exercise protocols would prevent expected increases in blood pressure (Njike et al., 2017 ) and fasting insulin concentration (Claesson et al., 2009 ). We also included measurements of glucose tolerance, blood lipids, endothelial function, and cardiorespiratory fitness as additional outcomes. 2 MATERIALS AND METHODS 2.1 Subjects This study was approved by the Arizona State University Institutional Review Board (IRB #00001517) and conformed to the ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki. All subjects provided informed written consent before participation. Inclusion criteria were as follows: men ages 18–50, nonsmoking, BMI between 25 and 45\xa0kg/m 2 , currently physically inactive (Tremblay et al., 2017 ) but capable of performing vigorous physical activity, providing “no” answers to any question on the Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire (PAR-Q) (Thomas et al., 1992 ), not currently taking any dietary supplements or medications for cardiovascular disease, hypertension or diabetes, and a willingness to consume two donuts per day, 6\xa0days per week for 4\xa0weeks. Thirty-three men were screened, and 28\xa0met all inclusion criteria and were enrolled in the study (Table 1 ). TABLE  1.

Following baseline assessments, participants were randomly assigned to one of three different groups: donut snacking without exercise training (Control, n =\xa09), donut snacking plus 1,000\xa0kcal/week of exercise as moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT, n =\xa09), and donut snacking plus 1,000\xa0kcal/week of exercise as high-intensity interval training (HIIT, n =\xa010) for 4\xa0weeks. Body weight and fat mass were the primary outcomes for this study. Secondary outcomes included blood pressure, glycemic control, blood lipids, endothelial function, and cardiorespiratory fitness. All experimental testing took place in a climate-controlled research laboratory. All subjects reported to the laboratory for baseline testing in the morning following a ≥10\xa0h overnight fast. Subjects were instructed to refrain from exercise, caffeine, and alcohol for ≥48\xa0h prior to each testing visit. Body composition, blood pressure, endothelial function, glycemic control, and cardiorespiratory fitness were all assessed in that order at each testing visit. For MICT and HIIT, post-testing was carried out ≥48\xa0h after the last exercise training session to avoid the acute effects of the last exercise bout (Mikines et al., 1989 ; Sylow et al., 2017 ). Control group subjects were assessed ≥48\xa0h after consuming their last donut. For each subject, the order and time of day for conducting these testing procedures were held constant to reduce the impact of diurnal variations on physiological outcome measures. 2.3 Anthropometrics, body composition, and energy balance Height and weight were assessed with a digital stadiometer (Seca 284, Seca, Hamburg, Germany). Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) (Lunar iDXA, GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK) was used to determine total percent body fat (%), fat mass (kg), and fat-free mass (kg), as well as regional fat distributions and visceral fat. Changes in energy balance for each subject during the 4-week intervention were estimated using the following formula: Energy balance\xa0=\xa0(Δ lean mass [kg]\xa0×\xa01,100\xa0kcal/kg)\xa0+\xa0(Δ fat mass [kg]\xa0×\xa09,540\xa0kcal/kg) (King et al., 2009 ; Sawyer et al., 2015a ). 2.4 Blood pressure Brachial artery and central aortic blood pressures were assessed using the SphygmoCor XCEL device (AtCor Medical Pty, West Ryde, NSW, Australia) (Gallagher et al., 2004 ; Karamanoglu et al., 1993 ). All measurements were performed in accordance with manufacturer recommendations. Subjects rested in a supine position in a quiet, dimly lit, climate-controlled room for a minimum of 15\xa0min prior to blood pressure measurements. Thereafter, brachial systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure\xa0were measured at the brachial artery in the left arm with an appropriately sized blood pressure cuff. At the same time, brachial artery waveforms were recorded for 5\xa0seconds and used to generate central aortic waveforms using a validated transfer function (Gallagher et al., 2004 ). This allows for the estimation of central systolic and diastolic blood pressures, which provide estimates of the maximum and minimum pressures in the aorta, respectively. All blood pressure measurements were done in triplicate, with the two closest values being averaged and used. 2.5 Endothelial function Endothelial function was assessed by flow-mediated dilation (FMD) of the brachial artery with a high-resolution ultrasound system (Terason t3000CV Ultrasound, Terason, Burlington, MA) following the latest established guidelines for the assessment of FMD (Harris et al., 2010 ; Thijssen et al., 2011 , 2019 ). This ultrasound system had a 12-MHz linear array probe with 60\xa0degrees of insonation. The same well-trained sonographer performed all FMDs. Measurements were made in a quiet, dimly lit, climate-controlled room after 20\xa0min of supine rest following confirmation of hemodynamic stability. All brachial artery images were taken on the subject's left arm (immobilized) in the longitudinal plane, proximal to antecubital fossa. The ultrasound procedure was individualized to optimize image clarity and avoid vessel branching. Probe location and image settings for the baseline assessment were recorded and repeated for the post-intervention assessment to ensure high reproducibility within-subject. A 1-min, B-mode video was captured to determine resting baseline brachial artery diameter. Thereafter, a blood pressure cuff (Hokanson E20 Rapid Cuff Inflator, Hokanson Inc., Bellevue, WA, USA) was placed 3\xa0cm distal to the antecubital fossa and rapidly inflated to >200\xa0mmHg (or greater than 50\xa0mmHg above systolic blood pressure) for 5\xa0min. Digital video was recorded for 1\xa0min prior to cuff release and for a minimum of 3\xa0min following cuff release to assess peak artery diameter, shear rate, and average blood velocity. Arterial diameters were calculated as the distance between anterior and posterior walls of the intima-lumen surface. FMD was defined as the change in arterial diameter from resting baseline to peak dilation following cuff release as a percentage of baseline diameter. Ultrasound images were recorded at 30 frames/second using Camtasia software (TechSmith, Okemos, MI, USA). All ultrasound images were analyzed in duplicate using semi-automated edge-detection software (Woodman et al., 2001 ) by a single investigator who was blinded to both time and group allocation. Intra-user reliability was as follows: baseline diameter (CV%\xa0=\xa00.2%, ICC\xa0=\xa00.99), peak diameter (CV%\xa0=\xa00.2%, ICC\xa0=\xa00.99), and FMD% (CV%\xa0=\xa04.2%, ICC\xa0=\xa00.97). A second investigator, also blinded to the experimental conditions, analyzed a subset of the images (n = 40) to assess inter-observer reliability. Inter-observer reliability was as follows: baseline diameter (CV%\xa0=\xa00.9%, ICC\xa0=\xa00.98), peak diameter (CV%\xa0=\xa01.6%, ICC\xa0=\xa00.96), and FMD% (CV%\xa0=\xa08.2%, ICC\xa0=\xa00.97). 2.6 Oral glucose tolerance testing and blood analyses Oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs) were performed after an overnight fast. An IV catheter was placed into an antecubital vein and venous blood samples were collected at baseline and every 30\xa0min (−30, 0, 30, 60, 90, 120\xa0min; 75\xa0g anhydrous glucose was ingested at timepoint 0). After each blood draw during the OGTT, the blood was placed into appropriately labeled vacutainers, processed, and stored at −80°C until assayed. Serum glucose concentration was analyzed using an automated chemistry analyzer (Cobas C111, Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN) using colorimetric enzymatic agents. Serum insulin concentration was measured using the ultrasensitive human radioimmunoassay kit (Millipore Corporation, Billerica, MA). Fasting serum lipids (total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c), and triglycerides) were analyzed using an automated chemistry analyzer (Cobas C111, Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN) using colorimetric enzymatic agents. All samples were run in duplicates and the mean value was calculated. Measured intra-assay CVs were as follows: glucose\xa0=\xa00.46%, insulin\xa0=\xa04.9%, total cholesterol\xa0=\xa00.46%, HDL-c\xa0=\xa00.45%, LDL-c\xa0=\xa00.52%, and triglycerides\xa0=\xa00.79%. 2.7 Cardiorespiratory fitness Maximum oxygen uptake (VO 2max ) was assessed during an incremental ramp test on an electronically braked cycle ergometer (VIAsprint, 150P, Ergoline, Bitz, Germany). Pulmonary ventilation and gas exchange were continuously measured via indirect calorimetry with a Parvo Medics TrueOne 2400 (Parvo Medics, Sandy, UT, USA) computerized metabolic measurement system. Heart rate was continuously measured with a Polar heart rate monitor (Polar Electro Inc., Lake Success, NY). A standard three-point calibration was performed prior to each test per manufacturer recommendations. After 2\xa0min of seated rest, subjects pedaled on a cycle ergometer at a cadence of their choice (60–80\xa0rpm) at 50\xa0W for 5\xa0min for the warm-up phase. After the warmup, power increased continuously in a ramp fashion (1\xa0W every 2\xa0s) until each subject reached volitional exhaustion despite strong verbal encouragement. After a 10-min cool-down phase of cycling at 50\xa0W, each subject performed a verification phase test consisting of cycling at a constant power output equivalent to 100% of maximum power achieved on the incremental ramp test (Sawyer et al., 2015b ; Tucker et al., 2015b ). Subjects were asked to keep their cadence above 50\xa0rpm and pedal for as long as possible during the verification phase. VO 2max was defined as the mean of the two highest consecutive 15-sec averages attained for VO 2 during either the incremental ramp or verification phase of the maximal exercise test. Maximal heart rate (HR max ) was defined as the highest HR achieved during either the incremental ramp or verification phase. 2.8 Habitual dietary intake and physical activity levels All subjects were asked to keep track of their habitual dietary intake by filling out a Three-Day Food Record at baseline (pre-intervention) and during week 4 of the intervention. Dietary intake was recorded on 2\xa0weekdays and 1\xa0weekend day and analyzed with nutritional analysis software (Diet Analysis Plus 10.0, Cengage, Independence, KY, USA) by a registered dietitian. To assess habitual physical activity levels, all subjects wore a validated physical activity monitor (SenseWear Armband, Model: WMS, Bodymedia, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) (Bhammar et al., 2016 ; Jakicic et al., 2004 ; Johannsen et al., 2010 ; Tucker et al., 2015a ) for 7\xa0days prior to baseline testing and again during week 4 of the intervention. Daily steps, and number of daily min of sedentary behavior and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) were measured and recorded during each day of wear. Subjects were instructed to wear the armband on the upper posterior aspect of the left arm throughout the day but permitted to remove the armband at night to avoid discomfort during sleep. In addition, the armband was removed prior to each exercise training session in subjects randomized to the exercise training groups. 2.9 Indulgent snack food All subjects were instructed to maintain their current diet while also consuming two donuts per day, 6\xa0days per week, for 4\xa0weeks. Donuts were purchased by our research team at a local Dunkin Donuts (Dunkin’ Brands, Canton, MA, USA) and given to our subjects to consume as snacks between meals. Subjects picked up the donuts from our laboratory three times per week in packages of four donuts (for freshness). For variety, subjects were allowed to select from a menu of donut options, in which donuts were categorized by energy content. By requiring subjects to select donuts in equal proportions from the different categories, this ensured that the total energy content of the donuts would be similar across subjects in the three groups. Donut nutrition information was obtained from the Dunkin Donuts website. All donuts contained between 250 and 350\xa0kcal, of which at least 70% of total calories were fat and sugar. Energy content of the two donuts consumed daily was ~600\xa0kcal, with the cumulative total energy value of ~14,500\xa0kcal during the 4\xa0weeks. A full energy and macronutrient profile of the 48 donuts consumed during the 4-week intervention is provided in Table 2 . TABLE  2.

No group differences present. Abbreviations: HIIT, High-intensity interval training; MICT, Moderate-intensity continuous training. 2.10 Exercise training All subjects randomized to exercise training (MICT or HIIT) completed four supervised exercise training sessions per week for 4\xa0weeks, for a total of 16 exercise sessions. All exercise training was performed on mechanically braked cycle ergometers (Monark Ergomedic 828E, Monark, Sweden). Heart rate was continuously monitored using a Polar heart rate monitor (Polar H7, Polar Electro OY, Kempele, Finland) and recorded during all exercise training sessions. MICT sessions consisted of a 5-min warm-up (50\xa0W), 30–45\xa0min of cycling at a HR associated with 50% VO 2max , and a 5-min cool down (50\xa0W). HIIT sessions consisted of a 5-min warm-up (50\xa0W), 8–11, 1-min cycling intervals at 90–95% HR max interspersed by 1-min active recovery periods (50\xa0W), and a 5-min cool down (50\xa0W). To ensure that exercise protocols were isoenergetic, total exercise duration was individualized based on baseline VO 2max to achieve approximately 250\xa0kcal total energy expenditure per session, including warm-up and cool-down. Subjects randomized to the control group were instructed to maintain their current physical activity pattern for the duration of the study. As incentive, control group subjects were offered 4\xa0weeks of free exercise training (either MICT or HIIT) upon completion of the study. 2.11 OGTT calculations Total area under the curve (tAUC) and incremental area under the curve (iAUC) for glucose and insulin, and OGTT-derived indices of insulin action were used to assess changes in glycemic control during the intervention. The trapezoidal rule was used to calculate tAUC by subtracting zero from the AUC and iAUC for glucose and insulin by subtracting the fasting value from AUC (Wolever & Jenkins, 1986 ). Insulin sensitivity index (ISI) was estimated by Matsuda Index (Matsuda & DeFronzo, 1999 ). The product of the glucose and insulin tAUCs during the first 30\xa0min of the OGTT was used to calculate the hepatic insulin resistance index (IRI) (Abdul-Ghani et al., 2007 ) as follows: IRI\xa0=\xa0(glucose tAUC 0-30min ×\xa0insulin tAUC 0-30min ). Hepatic IRI was divided by 1,000 for data presentation. The early insulin response (insulinogenic index [IGI]) was calculated as the ratio of the change in insulin concentration to the change in glucose concentration during the first 30\xa0min of OGTT (Abdul-Ghani et al., 2007 ) as follows: IGI\xa0=\xa0(insulin iAUC 0-30min /glucose iAUC 0-30min ). Beta-cell function was estimated using the oral disposition index (DI) as follows: DI\xa0=\xa0IGI X Matsuda ISI (Abdul-Ghani et al., 2007 ). The homeostatic model of assessment (HOMA-IR) score was calculated as follows: HOMA-IR\xa0=\xa0glucose (mmol/L)\xa0×\xa0insulin (μU/ml)/22.5). 2.12 FMD data analysis Inadequate scaling for FMD was not present as evidenced by the upper confidence limit of the regression slope of the relationship between the logarithmically transformed baseline and peak brachial artery diameters exceeding 1 (β\xa0±\xa0SE\xa0=\xa00.94; 95% CI\xa0=\xa00.86 to 1.02) (Atkinson et al., 2013 ). Therefore in accordance with the guidelines outlined by Atkinson et al. (Atkinson et al., 2013 ), allometric scaling was deemed unnecessary and the % FMD variable was utilized as the dependent variable. 2.13 Sample size estimates and statistical analysis Based on unpublished pilot data from our laboratory (Black, 2013 ), we calculated that the completion of 30 participants would yield 90% power to detect a 1.9\xa0kg difference in body weight between the control and exercise conditions (two-tailed α\xa0=\xa00.05) using G*Power 3.1\xa0software (Faul et al., 2007 ). All statistical analyses were performed with SPSS (SPSS 24.0, IBM, Armonk, NY) and Prism Software (GraphPad version 8, La Jolla, CA). All p values were two-sided and α\xa0<\xa00.05 was considered statistically significant. All variables are presented as mean ±\xa0SD, unless stated otherwise. All variables were checked regarding normal distribution using the Shapiro–Wilk test and logarithmically transformed if appropriate. Two-way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to assess the effect of time, condition, and time x condition interaction for all physiological variables studied. If the sphericity assumption was violated (Greenhouse-Geisser ε < 0.75), degrees of freedom (df values) for within-subject were adjusted using Greenhouse-Geisser correction. The Bonferroni adjustment was used for multiple comparisons when appropriate. One-way ANOVAs were used to assess group differences in subject characteristics at baseline, dietary composition of the donuts, and changes in calculated energy balance based on DXA results. 3 RESULTS 3.1 Habitual physical activity and dietary intake There was no change in objectively measured habitual physical activity in any group during the 4-week intervention (Table 3 ). Not including consumption of the donuts, habitual daily carbohydrate intake was lower by ~47\xa0g ( p =\xa00.02) and total energy intake lower by ~239\xa0kcal ( p =\xa00.05) in the control group, when comparing baseline and self-reported dietary intake during the fourth week of the study (Table 3 ). Habitual dietary intake was unchanged in both MICT and HIIT groups. TABLE  3.

There was a time x group interaction for body weight ( p =\xa00.02), with a mean increase in HIIT (+1.2\xa0kg; p =\xa00.02) and no change in both control and MICT. The increase in body weight in HIIT was primarily due to a mean increase of 0.9\xa0kg for fat-free mass ( p =\xa00.02). Fat mass was unchanged in all groups. Changes in energy balance\xa0from the DXA revealed no differences between groups (Control: +2,228\xa0±\xa09,494\xa0kcal, MICT: −3,291\xa0±\xa010,582\xa0kcal, HIIT: +5,942\xa0±\xa05,969\xa0kcal) ( p =\xa00.10). Despite the relatively unchanged mean data for body composition, there was considerable inter-individual variability for changes in body weight (−1.8\xa0kg to +3.1\xa0kg) (Figure 1A ), fat mass (−2.2\xa0kg to +1.7\xa0kg) (Figure 1B ), fat-free mass (−1.5\xa0kg to +2.5\xa0kg) (Figure 1C ), and body energy content based on DXA (−19,884\xa0kcal to +17,241\xa0kcal) (Figure 1D ) across all groups during the 4-week intervention.

However, visceral adipose tissue increased in HIIT by 6.4% (~88\xa0cm 3 ; p =\xa00.04) with no changes observed in control and MICT. 3.3 Cardiometabolic risk factors Changes in cardiometabolic risk factors are presented in Table 5 . Brachial artery and central aortic blood pressures were unchanged across all groups. Fasting glucose and insulin concentrations were also unchanged after the 4-week intervention. For the 2-h OGTT, there was a time\xa0×\xa0group interaction for glucose iAUC ( p =\xa00.04), with reductions in iAUC for both control ( p =\xa00.001) and MICT ( p =\xa00.01), but no change in the HIIT group. Insulin iAUC, hepatic IRI, IGI, DI, ISI, and HOMA-IR were unchanged across all groups. Blood lipid variables were also unchanged after the 4-week intervention. TABLE  5.

Subjects in the HIIT group performed 10\xa0±\xa01\xa0high-intensity intervals per session (range: 8 to 12 intervals). There was a time x group interaction for VO 2max ( p = 0.001), with similar increases in MICT (9.2%; 3.05\xa0±\xa00.68\xa0l/min to 3.33\xa0±\xa00.75\xa0l/min; p =\xa00.001) and HIIT (12.1%; 3.21\xa0±\xa00.49\xa0l/min to 3.60\xa0±\xa00.49\xa0l/min; p <\xa00.001) but no change in control (2.97\xa0±\xa00.49\xa0l/min to 2.96\xa0±\xa00.54\xa0l/min; p =\xa00.88) (Figure 3 ).

Surprisingly, consumption of ~14,500\xa0kcal of this indulgent snack food consisting of 70% fat and sugar, without exercise training, resulted in no changes in mean body weight or body fat. Thus, we were unable to reject the null hypothesis for our primary outcome. Previous studies on snacking demonstrate that some degree of energy compensation occurs, in which measured increases in body weight are invariably less than expected based on the additional energy content of the snacks (Claesson et al., 2009 ; Kant & Graubard, 2019 ; Lawton et al., 1998 ; Mazlan et al., 2006 ; Njike et al., 2017 ; Tey et al., 2011 ; Zaveri & Drummond, 2009 ). However, based on previous studies of snacking on indulgent foods, we anticipated that our control group would have gained body weight or body fat (Mazlan et al., 2006 ; Njike et al., 2017 ). The energy content of the 2-donut snacks (6\xa0days/week) in our study was ~600\xa0kcal, which is similar to the energy content of the indulgent food snacks in previous studies that reported increases in body weight (Mazlan et al., 2006 ; Njike et al., 2017 ) or body fat (Njike et al., 2017 ). We assessed dietary intake and physical activity levels at baseline and during the fourth week of the study. Results from our control group suggest that near-complete compensation occurred for habitual energy and carbohydrate intake. However, even if we assume that the ~239\xa0kcal/day lower energy intake during the fourth week is accurate, and we apply that to all 28\xa0days of the 4-week intervention, there is still a discrepancy of ~7,800\xa0kcal between the energy content of the 48 donuts and the estimated reduction in energy intake. Although our mean data suggest that energy compensation was essentially complete in the control group, there was considerable inter-subject variability in changes in weight, body fat, fat-free mass, and body energy content across all groups. Weight change ranged from a 1.8-kg loss to a 3.1-kg gain, and the change in energy content ranged from a decrease of 19,884\xa0kcal to a gain of 17,241\xa0kcal. Similar extreme changes in body weight (−2.3\xa0kg to +6.3\xa0kg) were reported in an observational study during a 5-week winter holiday period (Stevenson et al., 2013 ). Even over longer periods of caloric restriction, overfeeding, or exercise training, large inter-individual variability in body composition changes is well documented (Bouchard et al., 1990 ; Donnelly et al., 2003 ; King et al., 2008 ; Sawyer et al., 2015a ). Our results demonstrate that large inter-individual variability is also evident in response to snacking on indulgent foods such as donuts. In the exercise training groups, the total energy cost of exercise training was ~4,000\xa0kcal. Therefore, the exercise groups were expected to have an energy surplus of ~10,500\xa0kcal if habitual dietary intake and physical activity levels did not change during the study. Dietary records indicated no change in energy intake, and accelerometer data indicated that neither group changed habitual physical activity during the intervention, as there were no significant changes in daily steps, sedentary time, or moderate-to-vigorous physical activity minutes. Our results are similar to those reported previously in studies of excess energy intake in the face of altered physical activity. Men who consumed an excess of 11,327\xa0kcal over 7\xa0days increased body energy content (DXA) by only 3,814\xa0kcal and 6,824\xa0kcal in control and exercise groups, respectively (Walhin et al., 2013 ). Similarly, in another study, an excess energy intake of ~29,000\xa0kcal over 14\xa0days resulted in an increase in body energy content of only 13,136\xa0kcal (Krogh-Madsen et al., 2014 ). One previous study reported that 12\xa0weeks of snacking on cookies increased “visceral fat rating” assessed by Tanita SC-240 Body Composition Analyzer (Njike et al., 2017 ). Visceral abdominal fat was not increased in our control group, which may be due to a shorter duration of intervention. It could also be due to greater energy compensation or more precise assessment of visceral body fat (DXA). An unexpected finding of the present study was the 6% increase in visceral fat in the HIIT group. A high level of daily physical activity (~11,000\xa0steps/day) has been shown to prevent increases in visceral abdominal fat during a 14-day period of overfeeding (Krogh-Madsen et al., 2014 ). The modest increase in visceral abdominal fat in HIIT compared to no change in the control group was unexpected, and we have no explanation for this finding. HIIT in the absence of dietary changes has been reported to reduce visceral abdominal fat, but a meta-analysis indicated that lower intensity HIIT (<90 HR max ) was more effective than higher intensity HIIT (>90 HR max ) (Maillard et al., 2018 ). Our higher intensity HIIT program (90–95% HR max ) may not have been optimal to prevent the 6% increase in visceral abdominal fat during the 4\xa0weeks of snacking on donuts. Whether the modest increase in visceral abdominal fat in HIIT poses a health risk is of concern. It has previously been documented that visceral adipose tissue is associated with an increased risk of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes (Jensen, 1997 ; Piche et al., 2018 ). Furthermore, increases in visceral and abdominal adiposity during overfeeding have been shown to be strongly correlated with increased blood pressure and arterial stiffness in as little as 6–8\xa0weeks (Fabbrini et al., 2015 ; Orr et al., 2008 ) and insulin resistance (Fabbrini et al., 2015 ; Knudsen et al., 2012 ; Krogh-Madsen et al., 2014 ). Accordingly, it is important to note that blood pressure, blood lipids, and endothelial function were not adversely affected in the HIIT group in the current study. We did not observe any deleterious changes in blood pressure, blood lipids, or insulin resistance indices across all groups. In a prior study, snacking on cookies over 12\xa0weeks in overweight and obese middle-aged men and women (mean age\xa0=\xa056.5\xa0yr; BMI\xa0=\xa034.4\xa0kg/m 2 ) increased systolic and diastolic blood pressures by 6.2\xa0mmHg and 3.9\xa0mmHg, respectively (Njike et al., 2017 ). Mean resting blood pressures in that study were 121.4/71.6\xa0mmHg, slightly lower than blood pressures in our subjects. The lack of increase in blood pressures in our subjects may be due to the shorter duration of our study (4\xa0weeks vs. 12\xa0weeks). Furthermore, the increase in blood pressures in the previous study may also be due in part to the increase in both body fat percentage (+6.2%, from a baseline of 38.3%) and visceral fat rating (Njike et al., 2017 ). In contrast, total body fat was unchanged in our subjects, and visceral abdominal fat was unchanged in our control and MICT groups. Any potential adverse effect on blood pressure from the visceral abdominal fat increase in HIIT could have been offset by the exercise training. Finally, the lack of change in blood lipids observed in our study is consistent with results from other studies of indulgent food snacking (Claesson et al., 2009 ; Njike et al., 2017 ; Tey et al., 2011 ), even with excess energy intake from candy of ~1360\xa0kcal/day (Claesson et al., 2009 ). Studies of the effects of indulgent food snacking on glucose tolerance and insulin action are limited. In young men and women (mean BMI =\xa022.2\xa0kg/m 2 ), 2\xa0weeks of compulsory consumption of 20\xa0kcal/kg/day (~1,360\xa0kcal) of candy, while instructed to maintain a normal diet, increased fasting insulin concentration by 44% (Claesson et al., 2009 ). However, glucose tolerance was not assessed in that study, nor in other studies of snacking on indulgent foods (Lawton et al., 1998 ; Mazlan et al., 2006 ; Njike et al., 2017 ; Tey et al., 2011 ). In overfeeding studies with (Krogh-Madsen et al., 2014 ; Walhin et al., 2013 ) or without (Kechagias et al., 2008 ) mandatory decreases in daily step counts over 7–14\xa0days, deterioration of glucose tolerance and increases in fasting and 2-hour insulin concentrations have been reported. Unexpectedly, glucose tolerance improved in our control subjects as evidenced by a ~26% reduction in glucose iAUC during the OGTT. This improvement was comparable to the ~33% reduction in glucose iAUC in MICT. The improved glucose tolerance in MICT might be expected given the beneficial effects of exercise training on glucose metabolism. However, the lack of improvement in glucose tolerance in HIIT is difficult to explain (Angelopoulos et al., 2002 ; Babraj et al., 2009 ), especially since HIIT and MICT programs similar to those used in the present study have been reported to increase insulin sensitivity (Ryan et al., 2020 ) and improve glucose tolerance (Malin et al., 2019 ) by the same amount in overweight and obese men. However, it is important to note that this was a secondary outcome, and the study was not powered to detect differences in glucose tolerance. Even more puzzling is the improvement in glucose tolerance in the control group. To our knowledge, this is the first time this has been reported. Additional research is necessary to clarify whether this is a spurious finding. Endothelial function, assessed by FMD, was unchanged in all groups. We previously demonstrated that 4\xa0weeks of HIIT in obese men and women increased FMD by 51% (4.82% to 7.29%) (Sawyer et al., 2016 ). Training frequency in that study was 3\xa0days/week, compared to 4\xa0days/week in the present study. Thus, the training dose was slightly greater in the present study, which makes the lack of increase in FMD even more surprising. Although the consumption of ~14,500\xa0kcal of donuts was not sufficient to impair FMD in our sedentary control group, it may have prevented the expected increase in FMD in our HIIT group. Because our previous study (Sawyer et al., 2016 ) indicated that a similar MICT protocol did not increase FMD after 4\xa0weeks or 8\xa0weeks of training in obese men and women, the lack of increase in FMD in the current MICT group was not surprising. Although none of the previous studies of snacking assessed FMD, a recent study by Bock et al. (Bock et al., 2020 ) demonstrated that 1\xa0week of consuming 900\xa0kcal/day of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs), while maintaining a normal diet, impaired FMD in young, normal weight men. In subjects randomized to exercise training, the addition of 45\xa0min of moderate-intensity cycling (60–65% of age-predicted HR max ) on 5 of the 7 intervention days (900\xa0kcal/day of SSBs) not only prevented an impairment in endothelial function, but improved FMD by 18%. In our study, the energy content of the two donuts consumed each day (600\xa0kcal) was less than the energy content of the SSBs (900\xa0kcal) consumed in the study by Bock et al. ( 2020 ). As such, it is possible that our snack “dose” was not high enough in kcal and sugar to induce adverse cardiometabolic effects. 4.1 Strengths and limitations Our study has several strengths. This is the only study to examine the effects of indulgent food snacking, with or without exercise training, on men with BMI ≥25\xa0kg/m 2 . Our use of donuts as indulgent snack is novel and has ecological value since donuts are widely consumed and consist mainly of fat and sugar. Also, the additional energy content of the snacks (~600\xa0kcal/day) is more likely to represent real-life situations in comparison to the short-term overfeeding studies in which energy excess was >1,500\xa0kcal coupled with decreases in physical activity (Knudsen et al., 2012 ; Krogh-Madsen et al., 2014 ; Walhin et al., 2013 ). We used DXA (considered the practical gold standard) to measure changes in body composition. Finally, all exercise training sessions were supervised with 100% adherence to prescribed exercise intensity and volume. This study is not without limitations. The study duration was relatively short. However, increases in body weight have been reported in snacking studies as short as 1–2\xa0weeks (Claesson et al., 2009 ; Mazlan et al., 2006 ). Reliance on self-report dietary intake is a limitation as it has been shown to be prone to underreporting, especially in overweight and obese individuals (Dhurandhar et al., 2015 ; Lichtman et al., 1992 ; Schoeller et al., 1990 ). However, an in-patient study with strict dietary control (all meals fed to participants) was not feasible at our institution. Nonetheless, the self-report dietary data in the control group suggest that energy intake compensation occurred, which is consistent with previous studies on snacking (Claesson et al., 2009 ; Kant & Graubard, 2019 ; Lawton et al., 1998 ; Mazlan et al., 2006 ; Njike et al., 2017 ; Tey et al., 2011 ; Zaveri & Drummond, 2009 ). We did not have a gold-standard assessment of total energy expenditure such as doubly labeled water. Thus, we cannot be sure that total daily energy expenditure was not affected by donut consumption or exercise training. Increases in nonexercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT) may have occurred which could have offset the additional energy consumed from the donuts (Levine, 2007 ). Fat gain during an 8-week period of overfeeding was reported to be inversely correlated with the magnitude of NEAT in nonobese adults (Levine et al., 1999 ). We did not measure resting metabolic rate, which might have changed during the study. However, it is not likely that resting metabolic rate would have changed significantly in our subjects. Increases in resting metabolic rate during overfeeding is a function of changes in fat-free mass (Westerterp, 2017 ). Also, 14\xa0days of consuming an additional 20\xa0kcal/kg body weight per day (~1360\xa0kcal/day) as candy did not increase resting metabolic rate in nonobese adults (Claesson et al., 2009 ). Finally, a recent meta-analysis reported that aerobic exercise training has no appreciable effect on resting metabolic rate (MacKenzie-Shalders et al., 2020 ). During the 4-week intervention, accelerometry data were only collected during the fourth week, so it is possible that the measurements during week 4 did not accurately reflect physical activity during the entire 4\xa0weeks of snacking. However, the lack of increase in VO 2max in the control group suggests that control subjects did not perform any additional unmeasured physical activity during the intervention period sufficient to improve cardiorespiratory fitness. 5 CONCLUSION Consuming ~14,500 additional kcal (48 donuts) over 4\xa0weeks did not result in a gain in body weight or body fat and did not cause deterioration in several markers of cardiometabolic risk in overweight and obese men. In fact, oral glucose tolerance was improved in the control group despite no change in objectively measured physical activity during the 4-week period. Energy intake compensation likely occurred, as diet records indicated a reduction in total daily energy and carbohydrate intake. Both HIIT and MICT improved cardiorespiratory fitness but, aside from a reduction in glucose iAUC in MICT, experienced no improvements in blood pressure, blood lipids, or endothelial function. The lack of improvement in FMD following HIIT suggests that consumption of the donuts may have prevented the expected exercise training-induced improvement in endothelial function.

Tomlin 1 & Howard A. Wenger 1 16k Accesses 97 Altmetric 7 Mentions Explore all metrics Abstract A strong relationship between aerobic fitness and the aerobic response to repeated bouts of high intensity exercise has been established, suggesting that aerobic fitness is important in determining the magnitude of the oxidative response. The elevation of exercise oxygen consumption (V̇O 2 ) is at least partially responsible for the larger fast component of excess post-exercise oxygen consumption (EPOC) seen in endurance-trained athletes following intense intermittent exercise. Replenishment of phosphocreatine (PCr) has been linked to both fast EPOC and power recovery in repeated efforts. Although 31 P magnetic resonance spectroscopy studies appear to support a relationship between endurance training and PCr recovery following both submaximal work and repeated bouts of moderate intensity exercise, PCr resynthesis following single bouts of high intensity effort does not always correlate well with maximal oxygen consumption (V̇O 2max ). It appears that intense exercise involving larger muscle mass displays a stronger relationship between V̇O 2max and PCr resynthesis than does intense exercise utilising small muscle mass. A strong relationship between power recovery and endurance fitness, as measured by the percentage V̇O 2max corresponding to a blood lactate concentration of 4 mmol/L, has been demonstrated. The results from most studies examining power recovery and V̇O 2max seem to suggest that endurance training and/or a higher V̇O 2max results in superior power recovery across repeated bouts of high intensity intermittent exercise. Some studies have supported an association between aerobic fitness and lactate removal following high intensity exercise, whereas others have failed to confirm an association. Unfortunately, all studies have relied on measurements of blood lactate to reflect muscle lactate clearance, and different mathematical methods have been used for assessing blood lactate clearance, which may compromise conclusions on lactate removal. In summary , the literature suggests that aerobic fitness enhances recovery from high intensity intermittent exercise through increased aerobic response, improved lactate removal and enhanced PCr regeneration.

Copy URL Share a link Share on Email Facebook x LinkedIn Reddit Wechat Abstract To determine the effect of a 12-week high intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) intervention on total body, abdominal, trunk, visceral fat mass, and fat free mass of young overweight males.  Participants were randomly assigned to either exercise or control group. The intervention group received HIIE three times per week, 20\u2009min per session, for 12 weeks. Aerobic power improved significantly ( P < 0.001) by 15% for the exercising group. Exercisers compared to controls experienced significant weight loss of 1.5\u2009kg ( P < 0.005) and a significant reduction in total fat mass of 2\u2009kg ( P < 0.001). Abdominal and trunk adiposity was also significantly reduced in the exercising group by 0.1\u2009kg ( P < 0.05) and 1.5\u2009kg ( P < 0.001).  Also the exercise group had a significant ( P < 0.01) 17% reduction in visceral fat after 12 weeks of HIIE, whereas waist circumference was significantly decreased by week six ( P < 0.001). Fat free mass was significantly increased ( P < 0.05) in the exercising group by 0.4\u2009kg for the leg and 0.7\u2009kg for the trunk. No significant change ( P > 0.05) occurred in levels of insulin, HOMA-IR, and blood lipids. Twelve weeks of HIIE resulted in significant reductions \n\t\t\tin total, abdominal, trunk, and visceral fat and significant increases in fat free mass and aerobic power. 1. Introduction Obesity levels continue to increase in both developed and developing countries [ 1 ]. As being overweight is associated with numerous health problems, effective fat loss strategies are required [ 2 ]. Although dieting has been the major fat loss method, aerobic exercise programs have been shown to increase cardiorespiratory fitness [ 3 ] and preserve fat-free mass [ 4 ]. Most aerobic exercise interventions have consisted of moderate-intensity steady-state exercise, for about 30 to 40\u2009min for 3 to 4 days per week, over a four- to six-month period. Disappointingly, these kinds of exercise programs have resulted in minimal fat loss [ 5 , 6 ]. In contrast, high-intensity intermittent exercise (HIIE) has been shown to result in greater fat loss [ 7 ]. For example, Trapp et al. [ 8 ] conducted a HIIE program in young women for 15 weeks with three 20\u2009min sessions per week. HIIE consisted of an 8\u2009s sprint followed by 12\u2009s of low intensity cycling, repeated for 20\u2009min. Another group of women carried out an aerobic cycling protocol for 40\u2009min each session. Results showed that women in the HIIE group lost 2.5\u2009kg of subcutaneous fat, whereas no change occurred with steady state aerobic exercise. Fat loss accruing through 15 weeks of HIIE was attained with 50% less exercise time commitment and a similar energy expenditure to that of steady-state exercise. Importantly, the women in this study also showed a significant 0.6\u2009kg increase in fat-free mass (FFM) after HIIE, whereas FFM of the steady state exercise group was unchanged. The lack of increase in FFM accompanying steady-state exercise is in agreement with prior research in this area [ 9 ]. With regard to abdominal fat, 15 weeks of HIIE led to a 0.15\u2009kg reduction of fat in previously untrained young women [ 8 ]. As women in this study possessed moderate levels of abdominal fat it is feasible that the greater abdominal, trunk, and visceral fat of men may show greater reductions after exposure to HIIE. For example, Boudou et al. [ 10 ] studied older type 2 diabetic males and found that after 8 weeks of HIIE, abdominal adiposity was decreased by 44%. Whether regular HIIE will also reduce the abdominal and visceral fat of young nondiabetic but overweight males is undetermined. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine the effects of 20\u2009min bouts of HIIE, repeated three times weekly for 12 weeks, on body composition of overweight males. It was hypothesized that HIIE would result in significant reductions in total abdominal, trunk, and visceral fat and a significant increase in fat-free mass and aerobic power. 2. Subjects and Methods 2.1. Subjects Forty-six inactive, overweight men were recruited from a university population and randomly allocated into either exercise ( n = 25) or control groups ( n = 21). The exercisers and controls were similar in terms of age (24.7 ± 4.8 and 25.1 ± 3.9 years) and body mass index (BMI: 28.4 ± 0.5 and 29 ± 0.9\u2009kg m −2 ). The study received approval from a University Research Ethics Committee. Forty-six subjects underwent initial testing, however, for various reasons five withdrew from the exercise group and three from the control group. There was no significant difference for any variable between the nonadherents and those males who completed the study. 2.2. Procedures Subjects were advised to avoid strenuous activity and caffeine consumption for 24 hours prior to testing, and attended the laboratory after a 10-hour overnight fast. Tests for all subjects in control and exercise groups were completed at the same time of day. The Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire [ 11 ] was filled out and information on subjects’ personal and familial medical history obtained. Fasting blood (300\u2009mL) was drawn at baseline, and at weeks 3, 6, and 12 from an antecubital vein in EDTA vacutainers. An automated enzymatic method (Cholestech LDX, USA) was applied to quantify blood lipid profiles and glucose concentrations from whole blood. The remaining whole blood in EDTA tubes was spun immediately in a chilled centrifuge (Model Megafuge 1.0R, Heraeus, Germany) at 4°C and frozen at −86°C for later analysis. Aerobic power was assessed using a TrueMax 2400 Metabolic Cart (ParvoMedics Inc, USA) and an electronically braked cycle ergometer, Monark 869 (Monark, Sweden). For subjects who could not achieve the criteria for O 2max , due to the strenuous nature of the exercise session O 2peak was used as an indicant of aerobic power. 2.3. Resting Metabolic Rate (RMR) Fasted subjects relaxed in a reclined position for 30 minutes. Resting heart rate, resting energy expenditure (REE), O 2 , and CO 2 were assessed using a metabolic cart (TrueMax 2400 Metabolic Cart, ParvoMedics Inc, USA). O 2 represents the rate of oxygen utilised by subjects during exercise, whereas CO 2 represents the rate of carbon dioxide exhaled. Subjects were advised not to sleep and breathe naturally during testing. The first 10 minutes of data collection were excluded from analysis to allow for subject stabilization. 2.4. Diet Subjects in both exercise and control groups were advised to maintain their normal eating habits during the study. On their first and last visit to the laboratory subjects provided a 3-day diet inventory which was analyzed using diet analysis software (SERVE Nutrition Management Systems, Professional Edition, version 5, Australia). 2.5. Body Composition A Dual Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry (DEXA) scan with a Lunar Prodigy scanner (software version 7.51, GE Corporation, USA) was used to measure body mass and percentage body fat. Fat mass (FM) along with FFM in kg was measured for the whole body. DEXA also provided information on abdominal and trunk fat, as indicators of central adiposity. Computerised tomography (CT) scans (Philips Gemini GXL 16, the Netherlands) were also used to measure abdominal and visceral fat distribution. Axial slices (3 × 10\u2009mm) were performed through the abdomen at L2/L3 and L4/L5. Fat density of 0.9\u2009mg/L was assumed [ 12 ], and it was automatically selected at any tissue between 150 to 50 Hounsfield Units (HU). Gemini software (GXL Host system) was used to analyse the CT images. Abdominal, visceral, and subcutaneous fat were determined at the levels of L2/L3 and L4/L5. BMI was calculated by dividing weight by height squared (kg\u2009m −2 ). 2.6. High-Intensity Intermittent Exercise Training Subjects in the exercise group completed supervised exercise (8\u2009s sprint, 12\u2009s recovery) continuously throughout each 20-min session. The HIIE workload was set at 80–90% of each subject’s heart rate (HR) peak at a cadence between 120 and 130\u2009r.p.m and recovery was set at the same amount of resistance but at a cadence of 40\u2009r.p.m. Subjects were instructed to keep their exercise intensity at a level necessary to produce a HR between 80–90% of HR peak. As subjects adapted to HIIE training, workload was increased so HR stayed at the appropriate 80–90% HR peak level. HIIE was coordinated with a prerecorded compact disc counting down each sprint in a 3-2-1 manner. Subjects performed a 5-min warm-up and cool-down on the bike prior to and after each exercise session. All training cycling data included continuous recording of HR and r.p.m, whereas rating of perceived exertion [ 13 ] (RPE) was assessed at 5-min intervals. 2.7. Assays Insulin was measured using commercially available ELISA immunoassay kits. The degree of enzymatic turnover of the substrate was determined by dual wavelength absorbance measurement at 450 and 620\u2009nm (Dako K6219, Denmark). HOMA-IR, an insulin resistance index [ 14 ], was calculated as follows: (1) 2.8. Statistical Analysis Data were analysed with the Statistical Package for Social Science for Windows software (SPSS 18, USA). To examine changes after the intervention, an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to evaluate differences between the two groups for variables that did not violate ANCOVA assumptions. Preintervention values were used as covariates. Where assumptions were violated, an independent t -test was conducted on the difference scores. The statistical analysis was considered significant when the probability level was less than 0.05. 3. Results There was no significant difference between the two groups for body mass, BMI (Table 1 ), and age prior to the training program. Table  1.

Exercise Heart Rates, RPE, and Work Load The average HR during the HIIE training sessions for the exercise group was 160 ± 9 beats min −1 which corresponded to 88% of HR peak and the average RPE was 13.6 ± 0.5. Maximal work load significantly increased in the exercise group ( P < 0.001) by 43.5 watts (Table 1 ). 3.2.

Total Body Mass and Body Fat Assessed by DEXA Total body mass significantly decreased ( P < 0.005) in the exercise group (Table 1 ) by 1.5\u2009kg (2%), whereas total FM significantly decreased ( P < 0.005) by 2.0\u2009kg (6.7%; Figure 1 ). The FM of controls was unchanged after 12 weeks (Table 1 ). Percent body fat in exercisers at pretest was not correlated to changes in percent body fat after the intervention ( r = 0.17, P > 0.05).

The exercise group also significantly decreased ( P < 0.001) trunk fat by 1.4\u2009kg (8.4%), whereas trunk fat was slightly increased in controls (Table 2 ). Table  2.

Regional Body Composition Assessed by DEXA There was no significant difference between groups in absolute FM loss in the leg ( P > 0.05), whereas arm FM loss was greater for exercisers ( P < 0.01; Table 2 ). Total, leg, and trunk FFM ( P < 0.05) were significantly increased after 12 weeks of HIIE in the exercise group compared to the control group, whereas arm FFM ( P > 0.05) showed no significant change after the intervention (Figure 2 ).

Abdominal fat decreased by 8.5% at L2/L3 and 6.6% at L4/L5. Visceral fat was significantly decreased ( P < 0.05) by 17% at level L2/L3 and 10% at level L4/L5 (Table 3 ; Figure 3 ). Table  3.

Change in Body Composition after 3, 6, and 9 Weeks At weeks 3 and 6 there were no change in body mass and BMI, however, after 9 weeks body mass ( P < 0.005) and BMI ( P < 0.005) were significantly decreased. At the end of the trial, body mass and BMI were significantly decreased ( P < 0.001; Table 1 ), yet, at week 6, WC was significantly lower than that at baseline, from 93.3 to 90.7\u2009cm ( P < 0.001). There was a further WC reduction from week 6 (90.7\u2009cm) to week 12, (89.8\u2009cm), which was not significant ( P > 0.05). Also the major reduction in visceral fat brought about by HIIE appears to have occurred within the first six weeks as reduction in waist circumference was significantly correlated ( r = 0.57, P < 0.05) with reduction in visceral fat (L4/L5) at week six. 3.8. Response in Resting Metabolic Rate following the Intervention After the intervention exercise subjects had significantly lower resting HR ( P < 0.01) and respiratory quotient (RQ; P < 0.01) compared to subjects in the control group. There was no significant change in resting metabolic rate after the intervention ( P > 0.05), however, subjects in the exercise group had significantly higher (13%) fat oxidation ( P < 0.001) and lower carbohydrate oxidation ( P < 0.001) after the intervention compared to the control group (Table 1 ). 3.9. Response in Blood Variables following the Intervention Fasting glucose, plasma insulin, glucose, HOMA-IR, and lipid levels were unchanged in the exercise compared to the control group ( P > 0.05). For exercisers and controls preintervention levels of insulin, glucose, HOMA-IR, total cholesterol, triglyceride, low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein (Table 4 ) were within the normal range for males of this age [ 15 ].

Discussion The major findings of this study were that HIIE significantly increased O 2peak and significantly reduced total, abdominal, trunk, and visceral fat of young, overweight males. Also trunk and leg fat-free mass was significantly increased after HIIE. The 15% increase in O 2max is similar to results of a previous study that used a 8\u2009s/12\u2009s HIIE protocol [ 8 ]. Talanian et al. [ 16 ] also found that a HIIE program significantly elevated aerobic power. In this paper the oxidative enzyme β -hydroxy-acyl-CoA dehydrogenase was used as a marker of mitochondrial volume and showed that intermittent sprinting enhances mitochondrial capacity. Different forms of HIIE have also been shown to significantly increase aerobic power [ 17 , 18 ]. Thus, collectively these data show that HIIE results in significant improvements in aerobic fitness. The improvement in cardiorespiratory fitness after HIIE is an attractive feature of this mode of exercise as aerobic fitness has been shown to be an important predictor of positive health [ 19 ]. That HIIE resulted in significant subcutaneous fat reduction supports prior research in women using a similar protocol [ 8 ]. Results of the present study with males extend these findings showing that HIIE is an effective and efficient way of controlling body composition in both genders. With regard to abdominal fat, it has been found that 15 weeks of HIIE led to significantly reduced abdominal fat (0.15\u2009kg) in untrained young women [ 8 ]. The 0.13\u2009kg decrease in abdominal fat and 1.5\u2009kg decrease in trunk fat found in the current study demonstrates that this effect is also present in young males and supports findings by Boudou et al. [ 10 ] who showed that 8 weeks of HIIE significantly reduced abdominal adiposity in older diabetic males. The significant 17% decrease in visceral fat found in the present study extends the findings of Mourier et al. [ 20 ] who showed a significant reduction in visceral fat measured by MRI, following an exercise regimen consisting of steady-state exercise and HIIE for 8 weeks. These findings also add to the results of studies that have shown that aerobic training interventions decrease visceral adipose tissue [ 21 ]. The present study, however, appears to be the first to examine the effects of 20\u2009min bouts of HIIE on visceral fat of young males. As visceral compared to overall obesity is more strongly associated with cardiovascular disease risk [ 22 ] the ability of HIIE to reduce visceral fat may have positive health implications. For example, it was shown that reduction in visceral fat was associated with improvement in glucose and lipid metabolism, [ 3 ] whereas Okauchi et al. [ 23 ] found that a reduction in visceral fat lowered the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Interestingly, Ohkawara et al. [ 21 ] estimated the optimal dose of aerobic exercise necessary to significantly reduce visceral fat and concluded that 3,780\u2009kcal expended per week was needed. As an exercise session (e.g., cycling on a stationary cycle ergometer) lasting around an hour at a moderate exercise intensity expends about 520–550\u2009kcal then to reach an optimal exercise caloric expenditure of 3,780\u2009kcal per week an individual would have to perform approximately seven one-hour exercise sessions per week. In contrast, subjects in the present study exercised for only one hour per week. Also Donnelly et al. [ 24 ] conducted 16 months, 5 hours of aerobic exercise per week program with overweight young males and recorded a 23% decrease in visceral fat. Thus, it appears HIIE can bring about significant decreases in visceral fat with programs that are both significantly shorter in length (e.g., 16 months versus 3 months) and have less exercise commitment per week (5 hours versus 1 hour). Also the major decrease in visceral fat brought about by HIIE may have occurred within the first six weeks as reduction in visceral fat was correlated with reduction in waist circumference ( r = 0.57, P < 0.05) at week six after which waist circumference did not further decrease. Although the effect of HIIE on FFM has not been extensively examined, one study using DEXA found that trunk muscle mass was significantly increased in young females by 0.6\u2009kg after 15 weeks of HIIE, [ 8 ] whereas another study using MRI showed a significant increase in thigh muscle cross sectional area of older males and females after HIIE [ 10 ]. The 1.2\u2009kg increase in total FFM found after HIIE in the present study confirms the ability of this type of exercise to increase FFM. However, the length of this 12-week intervention was 3 weeks less than that conducted by Trapp et al. [ 8 ] that used females as subjects. As exercise HRs and relative exercise intensity of the two trials were similar it appears that males responded with a similar decrease in total fat but a greater increase in FFM after HIIE. FFM increase in the trunk after HIIE was 0.7\u2009kg for males and 0.4\u2009kg for females, whereas in the legs was 0.4\u2009kg for males and 0.1\u2009kg for females. Thus, males compared to females recorded greater increases in FFM in the trunk and legs. This characteristic may be important for fat loss programs as it has been shown that muscle mass is typically decreased after dietary restriction [ 25 ] and is typically unchanged after aerobic exercise training [ 9 ]. The significant increase in leg FFM may also reflect important metabolic adaptations resulting in enhanced insulin sensitivity [ 26 ]. Possible mechanisms underlying the HIIE-induced fat loss effect are undetermined but may include enhanced exercise and postexercise fat oxidation and suppressed postexercise appetite [ 7 ]. For example, Burgomaster et al. [ 26 ] and Talanian et al. [ 16 ] have shown that 6 to 7 sessions of HIIE had significant increases in whole body and skeletal muscle capacity for fatty acid oxidation. The excess postexercise oxygen consumption response to HIIE does not appear to have been examined, however, it is feasible that the significant levels of catecholamines generated during acute HIIE [ 27 ] could elevate postexercise fat oxidation. The significant catecholamine response to HIIE is in contrast to moderate, steady-state aerobic exercise that results in small increases in epinephrine and norepinephrine [ 28 ]. Also the high levels of catecholamines produced by HIIE may underlie its ability to reduce visceral fat, as catecholamines have been shown to drive lipolysis and are mainly responsible for fat release from visceral fat stores [ 29 ]. Also significantly, more β -adrenergic receptors have been found in visceral compared to subcutaneous fat [ 30 ] suggesting that HIIE may have greater potential than steady-state exercise (e.g., jogging, cycling) to reduce visceral fat. Furthermore, increased fat oxidation after HIIE may occur as a result of the need to remove lactate and H + and to resynthesize glycogen. Uncoupled respiration, protein turnover, and sympathetic nervous system activity may also contribute to increased energy expenditure and fat oxidation after exercise [ 9 ]. Finally, HIIE may also have a suppressive effect on appetite as exposing rats to hard exercise has been repeatedly reported to reduce food intake [ 31 ]. As this HIIE program required minimal time commitment, it has implications regarding subject compliance with exercise interventions. Thus, physical activity prescriptions, which require the least effort, while still producing adequate reductions in subcutaneous and visceral fat are likely to be optimal [ 9 ] and HIIE would seem to fall under this category as subject’s total exercise commitment was 60\u2009min per week. In conclusion, 20\u2009min of HIIE, performed three times per week for 12 weeks, resulted in significant reductions in total body, abdominal, trunk, and visceral fat and a significant increase in fat-free mass of overweight young males.

Physiologic effects of directional changes in intermittent exercise in soccer players. J Strength Cond Res 24(12): 3219-3226, 2010-The aim of the present study was to compare the physiologic impact of intermittent exercise in specific shuttle running (IS), which requires 180° directional changes, and traditional in-line (IL) running. Ten elite male adult soccer players performed different intermittent exercises according to their maximal aerobic velocity (νO 2 max): 30-30 seconds at 100% (30 s of runs at 100% of νO 2 max alternated with 30-s recovery period), 105%, and 110% of νO 2 max with active recovery, 15-15 seconds at 105%, 110%, and 115% of νO 2 max, and 10-10 seconds at 110%, 115%, and 120% of νO 2 max with passive recovery. Each exercise was performed in the IL and IS format in a randomized order. Heart rate (HR) expressed in percentage of HR reserve (HRres), postexercise blood lactate concentration [La], and ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) were recorded. The different 30-30 seconds showed significantly higher HRres responses in IS compared with IL ( p < 0.01). The [La] and RPE results indicated higher values in IS. In conclusion, the physiologic impact of specific IS is substantially higher than in traditional IL. The changes of direction induce an increase in the anaerobic metabolism solicitation and consequently create different responses compared with traditional IL running. This information can aid coaches in the design of intermittent training programs using classical (IL) or a specific form (IS) of running to induce different physiologic responses. Introduction Analyses of soccer match play have highlighted the intermittent nature of the game, and consequently, the capacity to repeat high-intensity exercise bouts is crucial. Intermittent exercise training is commonly used to recreate the actual demands of match play ( 2,16 ). This form of training involves alternating work and recovery periods (using active or passive recovery intervals) with the principal aim of optimizing the players' maximal oxygen uptake (O 2 max) ( 3 ). It allows players to work for longer durations than continuous exercise at the same intensity through reduced lactate accumulation (e.g., 22 ) because lactate is partly metabolized during recovery periods ( 1 ). At a physiologic level, intermittent exercise training provides a simultaneous and a mixed solicitation of the aerobic ( 23 ) and anaerobic metabolisms ( 2 ) and has been shown to improve the oxidative capacity of enzymes ( 34 ) and reaction time ( 27 ) while impacting the peripheral component of performance ( 6 ). The physiologic responses of traditional high-intensity intermittent exercise using in-line or straight-forward running (IL) are well-known (e.g. 3,15). However, activity profiles in soccer show that players do not only carry out in-line running actions. Therefore, if intermittent exercise training included directional changes, it would correspond more to the real demands of the game. Yet, the physiologic impact of intermittent shuttle running exercise (IS) is unclear, especially in soccer training, and the physiologic responses may be different from those obtained in IL running. In this context, no studies have compared responses in IS and IL, and a study on the real effects of IS needs to be made for use within soccer training programs. This type of effort is a common feature of soccer match play and training sessions because players frequently undertake running actions in which they accelerate, decelerate, and change direction before re-accelerating ( 15 ). These changes in speed and direction influence the musculature involved, thereby affecting energy use, and could result in higher physiologic responses when compared with habitual forward running movements ( 15,16 ). In this context, the aim of the present study was to investigate the physiologic impact of directional changes through the comparison of 2 types of high-intensity intermittent exercise: a traditional in-line intermittent exercise protocol versus a specific intermittent shuttle exercise protocol in which 180° directional changes, deceleration, and re-acceleration movements are required. This information can aid coaches in the design of intermittent training exercises programs that induce different training responses using classical (IL) or a specific form (IS) of intermittent exercise. We hypothesized that in-shuttle exercise induces higher physiologic responses than the same running speed in intermittent exercise performed in-line. Methods Experimental Approach to the Problem The subjects performed different intermittent exercises based on in-line running and shuttle running with 180° directional changes (IS) at several running intensities ( Table 1 ) determined according to their maximal aerobic velocity (νO 2 max). This variable is defined as the lowest velocity that elicits O 2 max and is a sensitive measure of aerobic capacity frequently used for prescription of training intensities ( 4 ). The νO 2 max values were obtained using the Leger-Boucher field test ( 26 ). Subjects were allowed to take part in testing if they presented no signs of illness/injury or fatigue; otherwise, exercise was deferred to the following day. All sessions were separated by at least 48 hours to minimize the effects of fatigue, and conditions were standardized. All testing sessions were performed on an ash running track or a synthetic soccer pitch to guarantee a controlled surface condition. This choice ensured more stable environmental conditions because the track in the present study was indoors (controlled temperature and humidity). The chronologic organization of testing ( Table 2 ) involved 2 randomized blocks (block 1 and 3) with the measurement of νO 2 max and a 5-week period in which the subjects performed different IS and IL. These 2 blocks were separated by a period in which players performed their usual soccer training without any specific fitness program (block 2) to limit the effects of habituation to the intermittent exercises ( 15,16 ). Measures of heart rate (HR), blood lactate ([La]), and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) were used to compare the physiologic responses between the 2 exercise types (i.e., IL and IS). Table 1: Short-duration intermittent exercise characteristics. Table 2: Experimental set-up.* Subjects Ten high-level soccer players participating in the amateur national championship volunteered to take part in the present study. The anthropometric and fitness characteristics of the subjects are presented in Table 3 . The study was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki, and the protocol was fully approved by the clinical research ethics committee before the start of the assessments. Written informed consent was received from all players after a detailed explanation about the aims, benefits, and risks involved with this investigation. Players were told they were free to withdraw from the study at any time without penalty. Table 3: Characteristics of subjects.* High-Intensity Intermittent Exercise After a standardized warm-up that included jogging and dynamic stretching exercises, all subjects performed each intermittent exercise in the 2 experimental conditions: in-line (IL) and shuttle running with 180° directional changes (IS) in a randomized order. All training sessions were performed at the same time of the day to limit the effects of the circadian variations on the measured variables, particularly on HR measures ( 17 ). Furthermore, concerning the IS, the calculation of the distance (42 m, 30 m, 21 m) allowed the researchers to define an identical number of directional changes during all shuttle training sessions for all subjects, taking into consideration the different intensities, the different duration periods, and the subjects' νO 2 max. The intensity of each intermittent exercise was performed in an equal or a higher value than 100% of the individual νO 2 max, with the aim of reaching a consistent time spent at a high percentage of O 2 max ( 32 ). Players performed 3 30-30-second intermittent exercise bouts composed of 30-second exercise periods (at 100%, 105%, and 110% of νO 2 max, respectively) followed by 30 seconds of active recovery periods (40% of νO 2 max), in accordance with Billat et al. ( 5 ). Subjects also performed 15-15 seconds with passive recovery at 105%, 110%, and 115% of νO 2 max and 10-10 seconds at 110%, 115%, and 120% of νO 2 max, in accordance with Dupont et al. ( 19 ). Heart Rate To obtain mean HRreserve percentage (%HRres), the subjects' HR was monitored continuously (5-s intervals) using portable HR monitors (Polar S-810, Polar-Electro, Kempele, Finland) during each exercise. The %HRres allows an interindividual comparison and was calculated using the formula proposed by Karvonen et al. ( 25 ): %HRres = (mean exercise HR - resting HR)/(HRmax - resting HR) * 100. The HRmax was considered to be the highest HR value recorded at the end of the Leger-Boucher test. Resting HR was the minimal value of HR obtained for 3 consecutive interval times after 10 minutes when players were in a quiet room on a mat in the supine position, with their eyes closed and without having performed any prior exercise. Postexercise Blood Lactate Concentration Taoutaou et al. ( 37 ) previously reported that the postexercise peak [La] was attained at approximately 3 minutes postexercise when no active recovery was performed. Blood lactate samples were therefore collected at the third minute postexercise from the fingertip after cleaning it by alcohol. The validity of the used portable analyzer (Lactate Pro, Arkray, Japan) has been demonstrated ( 35 ). Borg's Post-Effort Perception Scale The Borg scale method is based on a subject's RPE and is used to subjectively gauge the subject's level of intensity in testing, training, and competition. Borg ( 8 ) reported that the values of RPE can be used to compare physiologic ratings of perceived measurements such as HR or oxygen uptake (O 2 ). In the present study, each subject provided the RPE value corresponding to a subjective appreciation of the effort performed. The RPE scale proposed by Foster et al. ( 21 ) was used ( Table 4 ) because it permits the analysis of the global internal load in soccer training and the supramaximal intermittent exercise ( 14,24 ). Each estimation was recorded 2 minutes after the effort for each subject by the standardized question, “How was, and how did you feel the exercise,” used in previous study ( 30 ). No information was provided on previously recorded RPE values obtained in the other intermittent exercise testing. The RPE method was used 5 weeks before the experiment in normal training to ensure that subjects were accustomed to this method. Table 4: Adapted Borg's rate of perceived exertion scale as described by Foster et al. ( 24 ). Statistical Analyses All values are expressed as means ± SD . The normality distribution of the data was checked using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, and the statistical analysis variance homogeneity was provided by the Hartley test. After confirming normal distribution, a Student's paired t -test was used to analyze %HRres, postexercise [La], and posteffort RPE responses to the 2 intermittent exercise protocols at similar intensities. A one-way analysis of variance with repeated measures was also used to compare values for %HRres, [La], and RPE obtained in the 2 forms of intermittent exercises. Statistical significance was set at p ≤ 0.05. The reliability of each test was assessed by intraclass correlation coefficient and SEM as suggested by Weir ( 39 ). Results All the participants took part in the entire protocol and coped well with the exercises. High reliability was observed in %HRres, [La], and RPE measurements ( Table 5 ). The HR response analysis showed significantly greater ( p ≤ 0.01) values during 30-30-second intermittent exercise performed in shuttle (IS) in comparison with the IL ( Figure 1 ). In contrast, similar HR responses were observed in the 15-15 seconds and 10-10 seconds for both forms of exercise ( Figure 1 ). The comparison of the 2 forms of exercise (IS/IL) at the same intensity demonstrated significant higher [La] values ( p < 0.05) during IS exercise ( Figure 2 ), especially in the 15-15-second and the 10-10-second protocols ( p < 0.001).

Discussion The main objective of the present study was to investigate the physiologic responses to the 180° directional changes that occur during intermittent shuttle exercise and that are commonly observed in soccer play. In this context, the comparison of the impact on physiologic responses such as HR, RPE, and [La] between the classical in-line intermittent exercise (IL) and the specific intermittent shuttle exercise with 180° directional changes (IS) was examined. The present study mainly showed that the HR, [La], and RPE were significantly higher when intermittent exercise at the same intensity was performed in shuttle format compared with traditional in-line running. The HR responses during the 15-15-second and the 10-10-second exercise were similar in both IL and IS forms of running. The directional changes did not affect the central component, in other words, the HR responses. Indeed, in 10-10-second and 15-15-second high-intensity intermittent exercises, the aerobic metabolism contribution was lower than that of the anaerobic system ( 11 ) even if these exercise patterns are shown to significantly improve the cardiovascular system ( 19 ). A reasonable explanation may be that the work and recovery bouts may not be long enough to attain the slow component (phase III) in the O 2 kinetics ( 12 ). Indeed, the major part of energy expenditure and substrate use is produced from the adenosine triphosphate/creatine phosphate (PCr) metabolism, glycolysis, and a small part from fat oxidation ( 20 ). The passive recovery bouts allowed sufficient reloading of oxygen in myoglobin and hemoglobin, to partially remove a part of [La] produced, and to resynthesize the PCr ( 12,18 ). Consequently, the lower participation of the aerobic metabolism and its energy requirement during these efforts could explain why HR responses were not affected in IS with respect to IL. In contrast with the 10-10-second and 15-15-second exercise bouts, the comparison of %HRres showed greater values in the 30-30-second IS compared with the IL (+7.1%, p ≤ 0.01). The overall duration of the 10-10-second and the 15-15-second sessions (respectively, 6.50 min and 9.45 min) may be too short to produce significant changes in the cardiac responses to exercise. Bisciotti et al. ( 6 ) reported that IL highly taxes the aerobic system. Classically, the 30-30-second IL with active recovery allows athletes to spend a long time at O 2 max and therefore improves their O 2 max ( 5 ), limits glycogen depletion ( 11 ), optimizes the use of myoglobin and hemoglobin ( 28 ), supports fat oxidation, develops glycolitic enzymes ( 36 ), and improves buffer capacity ( 1 ). These studies have therefore demonstrated the importance of the aerobic metabolism contribution during 30-30-second IL. However, the application of the 30-30 second in IS format with directional changes would modify the contribution of the aerobic metabolism to energy expenditure. The central component would appear to be less involved in the energy processes during these particular IS. The 3 180° turn directional changes, which require decelerations and accelerations, relatively break the linear kinetics of the O 2 and solicit the anaerobic metabolism at a higher level ( 32 ). The importance of the energy expenditure is altered when directional changes are included in intermittent exercises, and, in the case of the 30-30-second exercise, the HR response was higher probably because of the increase in the energy cost and the significant elevation of muscular anaerobic solicitation. These effects were acute and corresponded to the increases in work bout intensity. In this context, Bisciotti et al. ( 6 ) has shown that the 30-30-second intermittent in-line protocol at 105% of the νO 2 max was slightly anaerobic, whereas the same protocol at 110% of νO 2 max was highly anaerobic in nature. In relation to IL exercise, RPE and [La] presented higher values for all intensities of IS. These results illustrate the greater physiologic impact generated by the succession of 180° directional changes, which involve decelerations and re-accelerations, as highlighted by Thompson et al. ( 38 ) and MacGregor et al. ( 29 ). The directional changes in IS require athletes to perform running actions in which they must sharply decelerate and block, implying eccentric muscular efforts and increasing energy cost ( 32 ). Moreover, subjects must re-accelerate, and this action solicits essentially the anaerobic metabolism and the fast twitch muscle fibers. Fast twitch fibers possess less mitochondrial and oxidative enzymes than slow twitch, but they present more glycolytic enzymes (PFK, LDH, and MDH) ( 20 ). Essen et al. ( 20 ) reported that the rate of PCr use decreased by 30% at the end of recovery bouts of a 15-15-second exercise. However, the [La] remained at an identical level to that observed in a continuous 60-minute run. The PCr use decrease could be one of the explanations for the [La] increase observed during the IS, which requires high levels of explosiveness. Another explanation is that glycolytic activity participates in a majority of the energy expenditure during decelerations and accelerations (i.e., intense muscular actions and increased muscular lactatacid concentration and thus venous [La]). Consequently, the 2 or 3 directional changes would appear sufficient to fatigue the players more quickly than the IL because a large increase in [La] (ranging from 20.3-25.8%) and RPE (ranging from 25.8-39.6%) was observed. The concentration of PCr would strongly decrease, and the depletion in PCr appears quickly because of the 180° turning movements and the deceleration and re-acceleration phases. The sequence of directional changes combined with high-intensity repetitions (from 100-120% of νO 2 max) and the short duration of the recovery bouts would have increased energy expenditure from the anaerobic metabolism and the energy cost compared with IL. Anaerobic glycolysis would take part more strongly and more quickly in the energy metabolism, and recovery periods would be too short to sufficiently metabolize [La] and restore PCr. Furthermore, an active recovery period increases lactate removal after intense exercise in IL ( 37 ), whereas the type of recovery does not affect the capacity to metabolize lactate and restore the PCr stock in IS. Indeed, the different intermittent exercises tested in the present study demonstrated similar physiologic responses ([La] and RPE) when they were performed in IS, although the 30-30 second was combined with active recovery and the 10-10 second and 15-15 second with passive recovery. The recovery duration would not be sufficient to highly metabolize lactate and restore the PCr stocks. The present study has highlighted that the physiologic impact of classical forward short-duration intermittent exercise (IL) was different from that observed in short-duration intermittent shuttle exercise (IS). The IS was shown to increase the intensity of exercise through the additional muscular actions (decelerations and re-accelerations) inducing higher glycolytic contribution, higher [La] values, and higher perceived exertion. The 180° directional changes would imply a faster and more important fatigability throughout the IS in comparison with the IL. However, the 180° turning technique used by some athletes could be better than by other athletes and may have affected results. At high speeds and during high-intensity IS, turning technique becomes more important, and anaerobic power is essential because players must accelerate after turning to obtain the desired speed. From a methodologic point of view, the Leger-Boucher test ( 26 ) might not provide an appropriate νO 2 max value to perform IS. Indeed, this test is continuous, and it does not consider the directional changes. Coaches and fitness trainers would be able to select the running intensities according to their objectives, but, in IS exercise regimes, these practitioners need a field test that proposes a reference value by taking into consideration the impact of directional changes. Nevertheless, data concerning the effects of directional changes during specific intermittent exercises are not numerous. The 20-m multistage fitness test of Brewer et al. ( 9 ) does not provide valid predictions of O 2 max ( 13,31 ). Consequently, the coach needs a specific value for the intermittent exercises because the O 2 max is not precise enough for this type of effort. There may be a notable difference between a νO 2 max value obtained through a test that involves forward running and a νO 2 max value obtained in a shuttle run test. This discrepancy has led to the development of the Intermittent Loughborough Shuttle Test ( 33 ) and the 30-15 IFT ( 10 ). The latter attempts take into consideration the additional energy cost generated by the 180° changes in direction during IS. The 30-15 IFT also improves the prescription of intermittent training interventions either using shuttles or forward runs. Buchheit ( 10 ) has shown that the maximal running speed (MRS) determined by the 30-15 IFT presented significantly less variation in interindividual differences in comparison with the MRS values determined by continuous tests. As the speed increases in the graded shuttle test, the anaerobic metabolism component becomes more important, and, therefore, low individual anaerobic power may cause an athlete to underperform in testing. Finally, the method of Blondel et al. ( 7 ) could be more efficient in the application of IS. They showed that, for the same percentage of νO 2 max, the anaerobic contribution to energy supply is different and could be dependent on the individual maximal running velocity (Vmax). It could be pertinent to perform intermittent exercises in reference to a percentage of the difference between νO 2 max and Vmax ( 7,16 ). This suggestion merits investigation, especially in IS running. Practical Application Previous studies have explored the physiologic impact of classical in-line high-intensity intermittent exercise, but few have analyzed the effects of directional changes in intermittent shuttle exercise that are more specific to soccer play. The results of the present study showed that intermittent shuttle exercise was more intensive than in-line running. Shuttle exercise increased physiologic responses possibly because of the additional muscular actions required in deceleration and re-acceleration actions, inducing a higher glycolytic contribution, higher [La] values, as well as higher perceived exertion. Intermittent exercise with directional changes allows one to solicit different physiologic responses compared with traditional IL and to recreate the common demands of soccer match play. According to the training objectives, the coach can choose between classical in-line intermittent exercise (more aerobic in nature) and specific intermittent exercise, integrating directional changes that promote more soccer-specific activity and a higher anaerobic stimulus.

Effects of intermittent-endurance fitness on match performance in young male soccer players. J Strength Cond Res 23(7): 1954-1959, 2009-The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of specific endurance (Yo-Yo Intermittent recovery test level 1, Yo-Yo IR1) on match performance in male youth soccer. Twenty-one young, male soccer players (age 14.1 ± 0.2 years) were involved in the study. Players were observed during international championship games of corresponding age categories and completed the Yo-Yo IR1 on a separate occasion. Physical (distance coverage) and physiological match demands were assessed using Global Positioning System technology and heart rate (HR) short-range telemetry, respectively. During the match (two 30-minutes halves), players covered 6,204 ± 731 m, of which 985 ± 362 m (16%) were performed at high intensities (speed >13 km·h −1 , HIA). A significant decrement (3.8%, p = 0.003) in match coverage was evident during the second half. No significant ( p = 0.07) difference between halves was observed for HIA ( p = 0.56) and sprint (speed >18 km·h −1 , SPR) distances. During the first and second halves, players attained the 86 ± 5.5 and 85 ± 6.0% of HRmax ( p = 0.17), respectively. Peak HR during the first and second halves were 100 ± 4 and 99.4 ± 4.7% of HRmax, respectively. Yo-Yo IR1 performance (842 ± 352 m) was significantly related to match HIA ( r = 0.77, p < 0.001) and total distance ( r = 0.65, p = 0.002). This study's results showed that specific endurance, as determined by Yo-Yo IR1 performance, positively affects physical match performance in male young soccer players. Consequently, the Yo-Yo IR1 test may be regarded as a valid test to assess game readiness and guide training prescription in male youth soccer players. Introduction Soccer is a multifaceted sport that requires well-developed physical fitness to be successfully played ( 28 ). Although no comparative studies have been performed, physiological match demands (% of maximal heart rate and maximal aerobic power) have been reported to be similar across competitive levels and gender in soccer ( 28 ), with any differences being attributable mainly to game intensity (distance covered at high intensity) as a reflection of players' fitness level ( 17,28 ). The ability to perform intermittent, high-intensity exercise for prolonged periods plays a key role in competitive soccer ( 15-17,19,20 ). As a consequence, training and testing strategies have been proposed to monitor and enhance players' ability to perform high-intensity activities during the match ( 12,14,23 ). Recently, with the aim to assess the intermittent endurance ability of soccer players in field condition, the Yo-Yo intermittent recovery test (Yo-Yo IR1) has been developed ( 4 ). The construct validity of the Yo-Yo intermittent recovery test (level 1, Yo-Yo IR1) as a measure of match-related physical performance has been demonstrated by studies showing a significant correlation between the Yo-Yo IR1 and the distance covered at high intensity during the match ( 15-17 ). Furthermore, improvement in Yo-Yo IR1 performance (distance covered) as a result of a high-intensity interval-training intervention was associated with changes in the amount of high-intensity activity performed during the match ( 15 ). Although talent selection is an uncertain procedure because there are many different factors that are involved in the development of a prospective player, knowledge of fitness profiles of successful players has been indicated as a valuable resource to guide talent selection and subsequent coaching ( 2,26,28,34 ). Additionally, the assessment of the changes induced by different training strategies on physical components relevant for soccer performance is important in the control of the training process ( 13 ). Therefore, the identification of valid field tests that enable the assessment of soccer-specific endurance in young soccer players is of paramount importance. Information in this context would be of particular interest to coaches and sport scientists for the development of talent selection procedures and to control training process ( 26 ). Despite the popularity of the Yo-Yo IR1 in soccer ( 4 ) and its suggested applicability for talent detection and selection ( 26 ), no study has addressed the validity of the Yo-Yo IR1 in youth soccer. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine the population validity of the Yo-Yo IR1 in young male soccer players (convergent evidence to construct validity) ( 32 ). We hypothesized a significant relationship between physical match demands and Yo-Yo IR1 performance in youth soccer players ( 28 ). Methods Experimental Approach to the Problem Population validity usually refers to the extent to which the results of a study can be generalized from the specific sample that was studied to a larger group of subjects ( 32 ). The association between Yo-Yo IR1 performance (distance covered) and match performance has been shown in adult male and female professional soccer players ( 4 ). Therefore, to verify the population validity of the Yo-Yo IR1 for young male soccer players, we examined the construct validity of the test as an indicator of physical match performance in young players by assessing the degree of association between match physical demands (distance covered in selected match activities) and Yo-Yo IR1 performance (convergent evidence) ( 28 ). Evidence for the construct validity of a field test is of great importance in sport science because it assesses the relevance of a field test to a given sport discipline in special populations (test specificity) ( 5,23 ). In this investigation, a nonexperimental, descriptive-correlation design was used to examine the relationship between Yo-Yo IR1 and physical match performance in young male soccer players. Players' physical load, measured as time and distance spent in selected match activities, was assessed using Global Position System technology (GPS, SPElite, GPsports, Australia). Physiological stress was assessed by monitoring heart rate (HR) during competitions ( 11,12 ). Subjects Twenty-one soccer players (age 14.1 ± 0.2 years, height 1.65 ± 5.1 cm, body mass 52.5 ± 25 kg) were randomly chosen among members of a national youth soccer academy (Federazione Sammarinese Giuoco Calcio, San Marino). Players (7 forwards, 7 midfield, and 7 defenders) possessed at least 4 years of experience in soccer training and competitions and took part in national and international championships at the time of the investigation. Players trained 3 times a week (∼90 minutes per session) with a competitive match taking place during the weekend. Training sessions consisted mainly of technical and tactical skill development (80% of the training time). Physical conditioning was performed 2 times a week and was aimed toward anaerobic and aerobic performance development ( 3 ). Anaerobic training consisted of plyometrics and sprint training drills ( 3 ). Aerobic fitness was developed using small-sided games ( 25 ) and short or long interval running ( 14 ). Testing procedures were performed during the last stage of the competitive season (April-May 2007). Written informed consent was received from all players and parents after verbal and written explanation of the experimental design and potential risks of the study. The local Institutional Review Board approved the study. All players were familiarized with the testing procedures used in this study through preinvestigation familiarization sessions. Performance Analyses In this study the players' activity profile was assessed using GPS technology. During competitive matches players wore a GPS device, inserted in a purpose-built backpack, that enabled speed and distance recording (1 Hz). Players' accelerations were also recorded using a triaxial built-in accelerometer with an operational sampling rate of 100 Hz (GPS, SPElite, GPsports, Australia). Validity of the GPS system used has been reported elsewhere ( 10,21,22,30,37 ). Match activities were determined according to Castagna et al. ( 6 ): Standing (ST, speed from 0 to 0.4 km·h −1 ); Walking (W, speed from 0.4 to 3.0 km·h −1 ); Jogging (J, speed from 3.0 to 8.0 km·h −1 )); Medium-intensity running (MIR, speed from 8.0 to 13.0 km·h −1 ); High-intensity running (HIR, speed from 13.0 to 18.0 km·h −1 ); Sprinting (SPR, speed >18.0 km·h −1 ); High-intensity activity (HIA; HIR+SPR). The competitive matches (11 vs. 11) were played at the same hour of the day (1530) on a regular size, synthetic-grass soccer pitch with each half lasting 30 minutes (10-minute interval). Air temperature and relative humidity during the matches were 23.5 ± 05°C and 35 ± 10.5%, respectively. To avoid dehydration, ad libitum drinking was permitted for the players. A minimum of 5 and a maximum of 8 players were observed during the same competitive match. The match activities' intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and coefficient of variation (CV) ranged between 0.92 and 0.98 and 13%, respectively. Heart Rate Heart rates were monitored with short-range telemetry every 5 seconds during the matches (GPS Elite, Gpsports, Australia) and with Yo-Yo IR1 (Polar Team-System, Kempele, Finland). Data analyses were performed with dedicated software packages (GPS Elite and Polar Team-System, respectively). Yo-Yo IR1 The Yo-Yo IR1 was performed according to the procedures suggested by Krustup et al. ( 16 ) and Castagna et al. ( 8 ). Yo-Yo IR1 performance was assessed 10 to 15 days before or after the competitive matches. Peak Yo-Yo IR1 HR was assumed as players' maximal HR value (HRmax) according to Krustrup et al. ( 16 ). Reliability of Yo-Yo IR1 was established in 18 participants tested 3 weeks apart. Results showed a ICC of 0.98 ( p < 0.0001) with a CV of 3.5%. Statistical Analyses Results are presented as mean ± SD . Data sets were checked for normality using the Shapiro-Wilks normality test and visual inspection. Differences between the first and second half were analyzed using paired t- tests. Relationships between variables were assessed using Pearson's product moment correlation. Fifteen preplanned comparisons were considered for this study. Accordingly, correction for multiple comparisons was undertaken using the Bonferroni method with a resulting operational alpha level of 0.003 ( p = 0.05/15). Results During the match players covered 6,204 ± 731 m, of which 985 ± 362 m (16%) were performed at HIA. A significant decrement (3.8%, p = 0.003) in match coverage was evident during the second half. Players covered significantly less (12.8%, p = 0.003) ground at MIR during the second half. No significant between-half differences were observed for HIA ( p = 0.56) and SPR ( p = 0.07). Details of match activities are presented in Table 1 . During the first and second half players attained the 86.2 ± 5.5 and 85.1 ± 6.0% of HRmax ( p = 0.17), respectively. Peak HR during the first and second halves were 100 ± 4 and 99.4 ± 4.7% of HRmax, respectively. Table 1: Match analysis data ( n = 21). Yo-Yo IR1 performance (842 ± 352 m) was significantly related to match HIA ( r = 0.77, p < 0.0001, Figure 1 ), match HIR ( r = 0.71, p = 0.0003), and total distance ( r = 0.65, p = 0.002, Figure 2 ). Figure 1: Individual relationship between match high-intensity activity (HIA) and Yo-Yo intermittent recovery test performance (Yo-Yo IR1). Figure 2: Individual relationship between total match distance and Yo-Yo intermittent recovery test performance (Yo-Yo IR1). Discussion The main finding of this study was that the individual level of intermittent-endurance fitness (i.e., YoYo IR1 distance) of the players was significantly correlated with several physical match variables. This confirmed our hypothesis and provided evidence for the construct validity of the Yo-Yo IR1 as an indicator of match-related physical performance in young male soccer players, thus extending previous findings reported for adult male and female soccer players ( 16,17 ). Indeed, the strong correlation ( r = 0.77, p < 0.001) found between HIA and Yo-Yo IR1 performance is similar to that reported by Krustrup et al. ( 16,17 ) for adult male ( r = 0.71, p < 0.05) and female ( r = 0.76, p < 0.05) soccer players. However, a higher association ( r = 0.65, p = 0.002) was found between total distance covered and Yo-Yo IR1 in young soccer players when compared to adult male ( r = 0.54, p < 0.05) and female ( r = 0.56, p < 0.05) professional players ( 16,17 ). In the present study we measured the physical match performance using a GPS system. Although various studies have provided preliminary results on the accuracy of GPS technology, the 1-Hz sampling rate may not be adequate to measure running activities at very high speeds such as sprinting. This may partially explain the lack of association between sprinting distance and Yo-Yo IR1 performance, in spite of a significant association with both HIR and HIA. Indeed, HIR and HIA constituted a larger range of speed and total distance covered (12 and 16% of total distance) when compared to sprinting distance, which corresponded to only 4% of total distance. Therefore, lack of accuracy at high speed might have affected the correlation analysis, obscuring a possible association with sprinting. Therefore, future studies using other systems ( 24,33 ) might be necessary to confirm our findings. However, to date no gold standard systems exist for the measurement of physical performance during a soccer match. Several methods-such as manual time motion analysis or computerized semi-automatic video match analysis image recognition systems-have been used ( 1,14,24,33,36 ), and to the authors' knowledge no studies have fully examined the accuracy of such methods ( 28 ). This study is the first to report on Yo-Yo IR1 performance values for young soccer players. Our results showed that young soccer players may cover distances in the range of 400 to 1,500 m on the Yo-Yo IR1. This is a significantly lower distance compared to those reported for moderately active adult male subjects (1,793 m, 600-2,320 m) and elite-level male (2,040-2260 m) and female (1,379 m, 600-1960 m) soccer players ( 16,17,19 ). However, these values are similar to those reported by Thomas et al. ( 31 ) for female field hockey players (840 ± 280 m) and adult (24.4 ± 6.0 years) male recreational team sports players (1,010 ± 419 m). Of note, the Yo-Yo IR1 distance covered by young soccer players was comparable to that reported for male adult elite team sport players (708 ± 157 m) and adult second-division male soccer players (771 ± 26 m) during level 2 of the Yo-Yo intermittent recovery test (Yo-Yo IR2) ( 18,31 ). In contrast to level 1, the Yo-Yo IR2 features higher running speeds over the 2 × 20-m shuttle running bouts, allowing the same 10-second recovery time after each 40 minutes ( 18 ). Given the higher physiological demands, the Yo-Yo IR2 has been indicated as a more anaerobic-based field test ( 18 ). Consequently, it could be speculated that for young soccer players, the physiological requirements of the Yo-Yo IR1 are less aerobic than those reported for adult subjects ( 16,18 ). Although the Yo-Yo IR1 test may be more demanding than other forms of shuttle running tests for endurance ( 7,8,35 ) usually suggested for young soccer players ( 26 ), the Yo-Yo IR1 requires a reduced testing time per player. This may be considered as a practical added value of the Yo-Yo IR1, along with its documented significant association with match high-intensity performance, to warrant the use of the Yo-Yo IR1 test for talent selection and development in youth soccer ( 26 ). The average distance covered by the players of this study was similar to what was reported by Castagna et al. ( 6 ) in younger (12 years) male soccer players (6,204 ± 731 vs. 6,175 ± 318 m, respectively). However, in contrast to Castagna et al. ( 6 ), a significant decrement (3.8%, p = 0.003) of total coverage was detected during the second half. According to Castagna et al. ( 6 ), no between-half effect was found for HIA, despite a significant MIR decrement during the second half. In this study the percentage of distance covered with HIA was larger than that reported in younger soccer players (16 vs. 9%) ( 6 ), which may suggest an age effect on game intensity. This is in line with Strøyer et al. ( 29 ), who reported a difference in absolute work rate (time spent in given match categories) in young soccer players of different maturation age. These findings seem to confirm the existence of a sort of “sparing behavior” adopted by young soccer players during the second half, limiting lower-intensity activities to sustain game tempo throughout the match ( 6 ). This strategy spontaneously adopted by players seems not to be fitness level dependent because no relationships were found between Yo-Yo IR1 performance and first- vs. second-half decrements in HIA. Nevertheless, because the players' physical fitness was strongly related to the amount of HIA performed, the need for a well-developed intermittent-endurance fitness, even at the youth level, is warranted. Several authors have suggested that soccer demands are similar across genders and competitive levels, with the difference occurring predominantly in match tempo ( 17,28 ). This studies findings are in line with this assumption because the mean %HRmax attained during the match was similar to those reported in elite male and female adult soccer players ( 17,28 ) and elite young soccer players ( 29 ). Additionally the total distance covered during the match was proportionally lower than that estimated for a 90-minute match in adult soccer players ( 9,24 ) and late adolescent soccer players ( 14 ). Differences in physical fitness may be a plausible explanation of the gender and competitive level work-rate dissimilarities reported ( 28 ). In light of the Krustrup et al. ( 17 ) findings that reported gender difference in Yo-Yo IR1 performance parallel to dissimilarities in match HIA, this study's results seem sustainable. However, a definitive inference will be possible only with gender and competitive-level cross-sectional designs considering match-analysis and fitness-level comparisons. Practical Applications Young soccer players should not be regarded as miniature adult players because remarkable discrepancies in physical and anthropometrical variables between the 2 populations are evident ( 26,27 ). However, coaches and strength and conditioning professionals should develop the technical skills and fitness abilities of the prospective players to cope with adult soccer demands ( 26,27 ). It is interesting that this and other studies' findings seem to suggest that youth soccer places on players the same relative physical demands seen in adult soccer ( 28 ). This suggests that young players, like their adult counterparts, require a well-developed physical fitness (mainly intermittent, high-intensity endurance) to play in the corresponding age category. Furthermore, the variety of maturation status present during the childhood and adolescence may even increase game demands when players of different growing stage face together ( 29 ). In light of the results of this study, the Yo-Yo IR1 may be considered as a valid test for the assessment of match-related physical fitness in young male soccer players. Therefore, the Yo-Yo IR1 should be considered as a valuable resource for coaches, fitness trainers, and sport scientists who deal with male youth soccer players in the attempt to assess young soccer players' readiness to compete and to guide the attainment of the fitness requirements suggested for adult soccer ( 16,19 ).

The purpose of this study was to compare the acute responses of this type of heavy-resistance exercise protocol in competitive body builders (BB) and power lifters (PL). Nine male BB and eight PL were matched for age, size and experience. A ten-station heavy-resistance exercise protocol was used. Each subject performed three sets of 10 repetition maximum (RM) with 10-s rest between sets and alternated 30-s and 60-s rest periods between exercises. No differences were observed in total work between the groups, but BB used a significantly ( P <0.05) higher percentage of their 1 RM in the bench press and leg press exercises. Heart rate, ratings of perceived exertion (RPE), and lactate levels were obtained during the exercise protocol; significant ( P <0.05) increases were observed above rest for these variables. RPE was significantly correlated with lactate levels ( r = 0.84). Plasma epinephrine, norepinephrine, dopamine, cortisol, and lactate levels significantly increased from pre- to 5 min post-exercise. Mean plasma volumes were reduced -16.6 (±3.64)% and -20.6 (±8.32)% following the exercise protocol for BB and PL, respectively. Significant ( P <0.05) decreases in eosinophil counts were observed following exercise. No significant differences were observed between BB and PL for any of the physiologic responses measured. PL exhibited a higher incidence (100%) of clinical symptoms of dizziness and nausea compared to BB (11.1%). These data suggest that exercise protocols used by BB results in a similar stress response in both types of competitive lifters. Still, BB appear to better tolerate this type of exercise protocol based on enhanced exercise performance and reduced sympatomatology. This may be due to different chronic adaptations associated with the respective styles of training used by these two groups of athletes.

This review discusses the body's response to an acute bout of exercise and long-term physiological adaptations to exercise training with an emphasis on endurance exercise . An overview is provided of skeletal muscle actions, muscle fiber types, and the major metabolic pathways involved in energy production. The importance of adequate fluid intake during exercise sessions to prevent impairments induced by dehydration on endurance exercise , muscular power, and strength is discussed. Physiological adaptations that result from regular exercise training such as increases in cardiorespiratory capacity and strength are mentioned. The review emphasizes the cardiovascular and metabolic adaptations that lead to improvements in maximal oxygen capacity. Introduction For decades, exercise has been used by physiologists as a research tool to understand the workings of several body systems, particularly the skeletal muscle, metabolism, the heart, and the peripheral circulation. More recently, physiologists have focused on understanding exercise itself, because regular physical activity has been shown to be important for disease prevention and health promotion. The purpose of this focused review is to discuss our current understanding of the human body's response to an acute bout of exercise. We will use endurance exercise as an example of this response. For more detailed discussions of other types of exercise, the reader is referred to several alternative sources. In the second part of the review, we also comment on the long-term adaptations induced by endurance exercise in some physiological systems. Section snippets Types of Skeletal Muscle Actions Movement, exercise, and sports require the generation of force by skeletal muscle fibers. Force can be generated while skeletal muscles remain static, become shorter, or increase in length [1]. These actions are the result of biochemical and structural changes that take place within the skeletal muscle fibers after neural activation and that need energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). During most types of exercise, muscles alternate between static and dynamic muscle actions. Muscle-Fiber Types Human skeletal muscle is a heterogeneous tissue in the sense that muscle fibers vary in terms of their mechanical, physiological, and biochemical properties (Table 1). Different methods have been used to classify skeletal muscle fibers, including histochemical techniques, such as ATPase and oxidative enzyme stains, measurements of contraction (twitch) or fiber-shortening velocity, and the identification of the myosin heavy chain isoform by using protein electrophoresis. In general, human Acute Metabolic Responses During Exercise Energy drawn from high-energy phosphate bonds is needed for muscle activity. The cell stores a small amount of ATP near the contractile proteins [3]. The use of this ATP is not dependent on a supply of oxygen, and, therefore, the energy is available as soon as the muscle requires it. For exercise to continue beyond a few seconds, cells must synthesize ATP through 1 of 2 metabolic pathways: anaerobic (glycolytic) or aerobic (oxidative). All energy systems contribute to meet the energy demands of Stored ATP and CP Energy at the onset of exercise and for muscle actions of very-high intensity (85%-100% of maximal capacity) and, therefore, of short duration (up to 10 seconds) is derived from a small amount of ATP and CP that is stored in muscle cells [5, 6, 7]. The total energy available in stored ATP-CP is enough for short-duration exercise, such as a weight lifting, high jump (Figure 4), or a 10-second sprint. Anaerobic Glycolysis During high-intensity exercise, the cardiovascular system is unable to supply the cells with Aerobic Metabolism If exercise intensity is low and there is a steady supply of oxygen to the cells, then energy is produced via oxidative phosphorylation [7]. The oxidative system has a high-energy yield and is the most important pathway for energy production during prolonged exercise. This aerobic process takes place in the mitochondria of active muscles and uses the Krebs cycle and the respiratory chain. The energy yield of aerobic metabolism is much higher than that obtained through anaerobic glycolysis: Acute Cardiovascular Responses During Exercise The determinants of oxygen consumption are summarized in the Fick equation as follows: V O 2 = CO × ( Ca O 2 − CV O 2 ) , where VO 2 is oxygen consumption, CO is cardiac output, and CaO 2 – CVO 2 is the O 2 difference between arterial and venous blood, or the a-vO 2 difference [10, 11]. Thus, there are 2 major factors that could limit VO 2 max: cardiac output and the capacity of active muscle to extract oxygen from arterial blood. Limitations to Oxygen Consumption During Exercise Chronic inactivity as well as several medical conditions [11, 12, 14] can impair one or more of the mechanisms involved in either oxygen transport (stroke volume and/or heart rate) or oxygen utilization (CaO 2 or CVO 2 ), which results in a decrease in VO 2 max and impaired exercise performance. For example, patients with aortic stenosis have a low stroke volume during exercise due to the increased resistance imposed by the stiff aortic valve, which leads to a reduction in maximal cardiac output, Factors That Affect Aerobic Exercise Performance The capacity for prolonged exercise and sports performance is also dependent on other factors, such as muscle buffering capacity, gender, age, and genetics [15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21]. Hydration and Muscle Function During Exercise During exercise, a substantial volume of body water may be lost via sweating to enable evaporative cooling, especially in hot environments [16, 23]. Sweating rates can be of 1-2 L per hour and even higher in well-trained and heat-acclimatized athletes [23]. Individuals who exercise for prolonged periods must drink fluid to restore the body's water loss and prevent dehydration [24]. Furthermore, many athletes carry a fluid deficit from their previous workout into the next workout, whereas others Exercise Prescription for the Development of Physiological Capacities According to the 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans [28], all adults need at least 2 hours and 30 minutes (150 minutes) of moderate-intensity aerobic activity every week in addition to muscle-strengthening activities that exercise all major muscle groups on 2 or more days a week. Regular physical activity and exercise can result in long-term functional and health benefits, such as a reduction in the risk of developing chronic diseases such as heart disease, some types of cancer, Long-Term Physiological Adaptations to Endurance Exercise Training Exercise training is associated with significant adaptations in many physiological systems that are specific to the type of training. This section will briefly summarize the main adaptations to one type of exercise training that emphasizes endurance. Other sources present a more detailed discussion of these adaptations [6, 11, 16]. Endurance training elicits many adaptations in skeletal muscles and in the metabolic and cardiorespiratory systems (Table 3). Together, these adaptations improve the Summary Regular exercise is important to improve physiological function, physical fitness, and health. Physical activity and fitness are associated with a lower prevalence of many chronic diseases such as heart disease, cancer, high blood pressure, and diabetes. Exercise activities can be categorized in terms of the major metabolic pathway involved in energy contribution: predominantly aerobic or predominantly anaerobic.

However, skeletal muscle can affect bone homeostasis also in a non-mechanical fashion, i.e., through its endocrine activity. Being recognized as an endocrine organ itself, skeletal muscle secretes a panel of cytokines and proteins named myokines, synthesized and secreted by myocytes in response to muscle contraction. Myokines exert an autocrine function in regulating muscle metabolism as well as a paracrine/endocrine regulatory function on distant organs and tissues, such as bone, adipose tissue, brain and liver. Physical activity is the primary physiological stimulus for bone anabolism (and/or catabolism) through the production and secretion of myokines, such as IL-6, irisin, IGF-1, FGF2, beside the direct effect of loading. Importantly, exercise-induced myokine can exert an anti-inflammatory action that is able to counteract not only acute inflammation due to an infection, but also a condition of chronic low-grade inflammation raised as consequence of physical inactivity, aging or metabolic disorders (i.e., obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus). In this review article, we will discuss the effects that some of the most studied exercise-induced myokines exert on bone formation and bone resorption, as well as a brief overview of the anti-inflammatory effects of myokines during the onset pathological conditions characterized by the development a systemic low-grade inflammation, such as sarcopenia, obesity and aging. New strategies in sport nutrition to increase exercise performance 2016, Free Radical Biology and Medicine Show abstract Despite over 50 years of research, the field of sports nutrition continues to grow at a rapid rate. Whilst the traditional research focus was one that centred on strategies to maximise competition performance, emerging data in the last decade has demonstrated how both macronutrient and micronutrient availability can play a prominent role in regulating those cell signalling pathways that modulate skeletal muscle adaptations to endurance and resistance training. Nonetheless, in the context of exercise performance, it is clear that carbohydrate (but not fat) still remains king and that carefully chosen ergogenic aids (e.g. caffeine, creatine, sodium bicarbonate, beta-alanine, nitrates) can all promote performance in the correct exercise setting. In relation to exercise training, however, it is now thought that strategic periods of reduced carbohydrate and elevated dietary protein intake may enhance training adaptations whereas high carbohydrate availability and antioxidant supplementation may actually attenuate training adaptation. Emerging evidence also suggests that vitamin D may play a regulatory role in muscle regeneration and subsequent hypertrophy following damaging forms of exercise. Finally, novel compounds (albeit largely examined in rodent models) such as epicatechins, nicotinamide riboside, resveratrol, β-hydroxy β-methylbutyrate, phosphatidic acid and ursolic acid may also promote or attenuate skeletal muscle adaptations to endurance and strength training. When taken together, it is clear that sports nutrition is very much at the heart of the Olympic motto, Citius, Altius, Fortius (faster, higher, stronger).

Physiologic and metabolic responses to a continuous functional resistance exercise workout. J Strength Cond Res 23(2): 373-379, 2009-The purpose of this study was to evaluate the physiologic and perceptual responses to a continuous functional exercise workout. Ten men and 10 women (21.2 ± 2.4 and 21.0 ± 1.5 years) completed a maximal oxygen uptake test, strength test, and body composition analysis. Subjects then participated in 3 familiarization sessions, during which they followed a videotaped routine that consisted of a series of functional resistance exercises performed in a continuous manner. Subjects performed the same routine in a final session, during which O 2 , co 2 , respiratory exchange ratio (RER), RPE, and heart rate were measured and blood samples were taken and analyzed for blood lactic acid concentration. Descriptive statistics were calculated for RPE, RER, blood lactic acid concentration, energy expenditure, and absolute and relative oxygen uptake and heart rate. Energy expenditure was calculated using O 2 and RER. Independent t -tests were used to examine differences between men and women for oxygen consumption, weight lifted, and energy expenditure during the workout. Subjects had a mean o 2 of 27.8 ml·kg −1 ·min −1 (51% of o 2 peak and 47.8% of o 2 reserve), a mean heart rate of 156 bpm (83% of maximum heart rate), and a mean RER of 0.91. The mean RPE was 5.9, and the mean difference between pre and post lactic acid concentration was 2.5 mmol·L −1 . The mean total caloric expenditure was 289 kcal. Men lifted significantly heavier weights and expended more total calories than women. Caloric expenditure (kcal·kg −1 ·min −1 ), o 2 , and weight lifted were similar between men and women when expressed relatively. Performing dynamic functional exercises in a continuous manner resulted in energy expenditure values, but not relative o 2 values, that meet the American College of Sports Medicine recommendations. Introduction The term “functional training” describes multiplanar, multijoint resistance exercises that simulate movement patterns from everyday life and sport. Functional training is believed to enhance neuromuscular coordination, with the assumption that the neuromuscular improvements will enhance performance in activities of daily living (ADLs) or sport ( 4 ). However, although functional training has increased in popularity, the cardiovascular and muscular benefits have not been quantified. Most publications on functional training are primarily descriptive or provide anecdotal information ( 4,16 ). There is limited research documenting improvements in physiological response after training, and the only empirical evidence is on the effects of a functional exercise program on the performance of ADLs in older adults ( 6,18 ). De Vreede et al. ( 6 ) have compared the effects of functional exercises vs. resistance exercises on daily living task performance in elderly women. The daily living tasks included movements with vertical and horizontal components, carrying an object, and changing between lying, sitting, and standing postures. The subjects in the resistance exercise group performed 30 minutes of resistance exercise training in the muscle groups deemed important for daily task performance. The exercises were performed in sets of 10 repetitions. The subjects in the functional training group performed activities that mimicked the target daily living tasks in sets of 5-10 repetitions, with resistance increased on the basis of subject tolerance. A control group maintained typical daily activity. At the end of 12 weeks of participation, the functional training group exhibited the greatest improvements in task performance (as measured by the Assessment of Daily Activity Performance), although the resistance exercise group exhibited the greatest improvements in strength. The functional training group also maintained their task performance gains 6 months after the program. The authors attribute their results to the enhanced specificity of the functional training over the resistance exercise training in terms of cognitive, perceptual, and motor functions. Functional resistance exercise training tends to emphasize neuromuscular coordination, technique, posture, and core musculature engagement over the amount of resistance lifted, making it well suited for use in a continuous format with short or no rest periods, similar to circuit weight training. Previous research suggests that although circuit weight training can improve muscle fitness, it does not provide an adequate cardiovascular training stimulus or lead to large improvements in cardiovascular fitness ( 2,9-12,14,19 ). Performing functional resistance exercises in a continuous format has the potential to provide a better cardiorespiratory stimulus than circuit weight training through the use of dynamic traveling patterns within both upper and lower extremities. This allows continuous use of the large muscle groups, which is a recommended component of cardiorespiratory endurance exercise prescription ( 1 ). In addition, functional resistance exercises performed with a resistance imposing an overload are likely to improve muscular strength and endurance. An exercise mode incorporating both aerobic and resistance exercise components is highly desirable because combining both types of training would reduce the exercise session time requirement for participants, which could improve adherence to an exercise program ( 7 ). Given the increased availability of functional training equipment in fitness clubs, many participants would be able to perform functional exercise individually or in a group exercise format. With a paucity of research documenting the effects of functional training, the purpose of this investigation was to examine the physiological and metabolic responses to a single continuous functional resistance exercise (CFE) workout. We hypothesized that performing functional exercise in this format would meet the recommendations set by the ACSM for energy expenditure and cardiorespiratory training. Methods Experimental Approach to the Problem Twenty women and men participated in baseline maximal oxygen consumption and strength testing before participation in 3 familiarization sessions and 1 data collection session during which they performed a 40-minute CFE routine. During the data collection session, oxygen consumption, respiratory exchange ratio (RER), heart rate, rating of perceived exertion (RPE), and blood pressure were measured throughout the functional exercise, and lactic acid concentration was measured pre- and postexercise. Caloric expenditure was calculated using oxygen consumption and RER values obtained during the exercise. Subjects Ten women and 10 men, ages 19-27 years old, volunteered to participate in this study. Subjects were recruited from kinesiology classes at a midwestern university. All subjects provided informed consent and completed a physical activity questionnaire (PAR-Q), medical history form, and an activity history questionnaire. Subjects self-reported being moderately trained, recreational weight lifters, with no functional training experience. A recreational weight lifter was defined as having lifted weights 2-3 times per week and having done so for at least 6 months. In addition, subjects reported that they were not taking performance-enhancing drugs at the time of the experiment and had no musculoskeletal disorders that would prohibit exercise testing. Subjects were required to abstain from food for at least 3 hours before testing and abstain from strenuous activity on the day of testing. The protocol was approved by the institutional review board of the university. Procedures Session 1: Assessments Each subject was measured for height, weight, and body composition. Body composition was measured via skinfold caliper analysis, using the methods of Jackson and Pollock ( 13 ). After anthropometric data were collected, subjects underwent a maximal oxygen uptake test (o 2 max test) on a Quinton medical treadmill using the Bruce ramp protocol ( 1 ). Subjects were encouraged to exercise as long as possible. Oxygen uptake, blood pressure, and heart rate were monitored continuously throughout the test using a MedGraphics VO 2000 portable metabolic system (St. Paul, Minn), a portable sphygmomanometer, and a Polar heart watch, respectively. o 2 peak was recorded as the highest oxygen uptake value obtained. The metabolic equipment was calibrated before exercise using autocalibration following the manufacturer's recommendation. Subjects also performed a submaximal (5-repetition maximum [RM]) test using the functional training equipment to identify the maximum resistance at which 5 repetitions of a single arm press could be performed while in a staggered stance. The criteria were to maintain proper form, defined as maintaining a neutral back and neck with a tight core, with no evident leaning, and no facial signs of physiological strain. Sessions 2-4: Familiarization Sessions After 2 days of rest, each subject participated in 3 familiarization sessions during which they followed a 40-minute videotaped routine of functional exercises choreographed and performed by a National Academy of Sports Medicine-certified master trainer using a FreeMotion cable column. The cable column has a pulley system that adjusts vertically from 36 to 213 cm, and contains a weight stack ranging from 5.5 to 110 kg, increasing by 5.5-kg increments. The cable allows 244 cm of travel. Cable attachments include 1 short and 2 long handles and an ankle cuff. The routine included a 7-minute warm-up, 3 × 9.5-minute exercise segments, and a 4.5-minute cool-down. The format of the CFE workout was similar to circuit weight training in that the exercises were performed in succession. The total exercise time, not including warm-up and cool-down, was approximately 28.5 minutes. Each of the 3 exercise segments was performed with the cable secured at a different height on the column: low (36 cm), mid (127 cm), and high (213 cm). The routine, detailed in Table 1 , included activities using whole-body movements and dynamic traveling patterns that reflect sport and activities of daily living-like characteristics. The warm-up and cool-down included basic arm and leg patterns and were performed with the cable secured at midheight. Warm-up exercises included overhead circles with a side lunge pattern, side-to-side rotation with a lunge pattern, and stationary overhead lift, all using light resistances. Each exercise segment included whole-body exercises with press, pull, and fly patterns for the upper body, and dynamic traveling patterns for the lower body, including side-to-side lunges, steps, or hops. Both the upper body and lower body were engaged for most exercises. A few exercises were highly sport-specific. For example, at the low height, subjects performed a “speed skater” movement with the resistance attached to the ankle cuff, and a tennis forehand and backhand with a travel pattern using a short handle attached to the weight stack of the cable column. Of the 21 total exercises, there were only 3 exercises that required the resistance to be attached to the ankle cuff. These were all performed at the low height. The remaining 18 exercises required the resistance to be lifted by the upper-body musculature in conjunction with lower-body movements or stabilization. Three exercises included single-leg stabilization while performing a fly or pull with the upper body. All exercises were performed for 10 repetitions on both the right and left sides and were performed in a continuous manner. The resistance was changed by the tester between exercises. There were 7 exercises performed at each handle height, and each exercise took approximately 1.5 minutes to complete. Table 1: Exercise protocol. During all familiarization sessions, subjects were monitored by a certified exercise specialist or personal trainer for correct form and technique. If subjects deviated from correct form, the trainer provided verbal and visual cues to correct the problem. During the first familiarization session, resistances were selected based on the ability of the subject to maintain proper form and adequately perform the exercise. In subsequent sessions, subjects were required to maintain the same pace as the video instructor and were encouraged to cover as much space as possible with their movements. The resistance was altered as deemed necessary by the trainer, based on subject performance and the subject's subjective tolerance of the resistance for a given exercise. For instance, if subjects were obviously struggling to maintain proper form and/or were performing the exercises at a slower pace than the video instructor, resistance was decreased. If subjects were moving too quickly or the cables were too slack, resistance was increased. Subjects gained skill across the 3 familiarization sessions and were all highly skilled by the final session; thus, the subjects were able to perform all exercises at the proper pace and with the proper form. This allowed a final determination of the target resistance for the data collection session by the third familiarization session. The mean resistance lifted for men was 11.2 ± 0.8 kg, and for women it was 6.5 ± 0.8 kg. Subjects were given at least 2 days of rest between each familiarization session and between the final familiarization session and the data collection session. Final Session: Data Collection Session For data collection, subjects performed the videotaped exercise routine used in the familiarization sessions. The final resistance from familiarization session 3 was used in this session. Subjects were fitted with a Polar heart watch and a belt that held the analyzer for the MedGraphics VO 2000 system. Subjects also wore a neoprene mask connected by the sampling tubes to the analyzer. Oxygen uptake was monitored continuously via telemetry using the MedGraphics VO 2000 portable metabolic system, calibrated as detailed above. Caloric expenditure was calculated using o 2 and RER averaged for each minute of exercise in each segment. Heart rate was measured via telemetry using the Polar heart system. Blood pressure was measured pre- and postexercise using a portable sphygmomanometer. Ratings of perceived exertion for the overall body were assessed at the end of each exercise segment using the OMNI Scale for Resistance Exercise (OMNI-RES) to assess the subjects' exercise tolerance ( 15 ). Blood lactic acid was measured preexercise and 4 minutes postexercise by means of a finger prick and was measured with an Accusport portable lactate analyzer. Blood samples were taken from different fingers for the 2 measurements. As in the familiarization sessions, a certified exercise specialist or personal trainer monitored form and technique and changed the resistance, cable height, and attachments when necessary. Statistical Analyses Only data from the 3 exercise segments of the data collection session, not the warm-up and cool-down, were analyzed. Descriptive statistics (mean and SD ) for subject characteristics, physiological, and metabolic variables were calculated for men, women, and all subjects combined. Independent t -tests were performed to compare men and women for RER, absolute and relative o 2 , % o 2 reserve (% O 2 R), absolute and relative heart rate, average resistance lifted, average % 5RM lifted, difference in pre and post lactate values, overall RPE, energy expenditure (total kilocalories, kilocalories per minute, and kilocalories per kilogram per minute), percent fat, and body weight. The alpha level was adjusted using the Bonferroni procedure (0.05/15 = 0.003) where appropriate. Pearson correlations were calculated to examine the relationship between absolute and relative resistance lifted, relative o 2 , relative o 2 R, and absolute and relative energy expenditure. All analyses were carried out using SPSS software version 14.0 (SPSS, Chicago, Ill), and an alpha level of p ≤ 0.05 was used to establish statistical significance. Results The subject characteristics are presented in Table 1 . Independent t -tests showed that there were significant differences between men and women in height, body weight, and percent fat. As expected, men were significantly taller and heavier and had significantly lower percentages of fat than women. There were no significant differences between men and women in age, maximum heart rate (HRmax), or o 2 max. The descriptive statistics for the 28.5-minute CFE segment are presented in Table 2 . As a group, subjects performed the functional workout at a mean o 2 of 27.8 ± 5.4 ml·kg −1 ·min −1 (51.1 ± 9.7% o 2 peak and 47.8 ± 10.2% o 2 R) and a mean heart rate of 156 ± 13.9 bpm (82.7 ± 6.0% HRmax). The mean RER was 0.91 ± 0.05. The mean energy expenditure was 289.2 ± 82.2 kcal (10.2 ± 2.9 kcal·min -1 , or 0.14 ± 0.03 kcal·kg −1 ·min −1 ). The mean post lactate value was 4.5 ± 1.3 mmol·L −1 , and the pre-post lactate difference was 2.5 ± 1.4 mmol·L −1 . Lactate data were not available for 1 subject because of equipment limitations. The mean RPE was 5.9 ± 1.5, or “somewhat hard.” Table 2: Subject characteristics (mean ± SD ). Independent t -tests indicated no significant differences between men and women for RER, absolute or relative o 2 , % o 2 R, absolute or relative heart rate, relative resistance lifted (% 5RM), lactate difference, overall RPE, or energy expenditure when expressed as kilocalories per kilogram per minute. As would be expected, men lifted significantly ( p < 0.001) heavier resistance than women when expressed absolutely (kg), and men also exhibited greater energy expenditure than women when expressed as kilocalories ( p < 0.002) or kilocalories per minute ( p < 0.002). Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated with men and women combined and are presented in Table 3 . The Pearson correlations indicate a moderate positive relationship between % 5RM lifted and % o 2 peak ( r = 0.49, p < 0.05) and % o 2 R (0.50, p < 0.05) and between % 5RM lifted and energy expenditure in kilocalories per kilogram per minute ( r = 0.50, p < 0.05). As expected, a strong positive relationship was found between energy expenditure expressed in relative terms (kcal·kg −1 ·min −1 ) and energy expenditure expressed in absolute terms (kcal·min -1 or kcal) ( r = 0.68, p < 0.01). In addition, energy expenditure (kcal·kg −1 ·min −1 , kcal·min −1 , kcal) was related to both % o 2 peak ( r = 0.75, 0.73, and 0.73, respectively; p < 0.01) and % o 2 R ( r = 0.78, 0.74, and 0.74, respectively; p < 0.01). The correlation between absolute energy expenditure (kcal·min −1 or kcal) and absolute weight lifted in kilograms was also significant ( r = 0.74; p < 0.01). No other significant correlations were found between absolute and relative resistance lifted, relative oxygen uptake, or absolute and relative energy expenditure ( Table 4 ). Table 3: Mean values (± SD ) for physiologic and metabolic variables. Table 4: Intercorrelation matrix between weight lifted, energy expenditure, and relative oxygen uptake ( N = 20). Discussion The purpose of this investigation was to examine the physiologic and metabolic responses to a CFE workout. The format of the workout included dynamic functional exercises that engaged both the upper and lower body simultaneously and incorporated dynamic traveling patterns. It was hypothesized that the functional exercise performed in a continuous manner would meet the recommendations of the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) for energy expenditure and for improving cardiovascular fitness. According to the ACSM, the recommended guidelines for improving cardiovascular fitness are to perform exercise at an intensity of 50-85% o 2 R ( 1 ). The ACSM also recommends an energy expenditure of 150-400 kcal·d −1 from physical activity ( 1 ). The CFE workout examined in this investigation meets the energy expenditure recommendations, with a mean expenditure of 289 kcal for 28.5 minutes of exercise. However, as a group, subjects performing the CFE workout did not meet the ACSM intensity recommendations for improving cardiovascular fitness, because the mean % o 2 R was 47.8%. It is important to note that maximal oxygen uptake was measured in a mode different from the exercise mode performed in the data collection session. A mode-specific o 2 peak value may have produced different results in terms of the relative oxygen uptake achieved during the CFE workout. The individual average % o 2 R from the CFE workout ranged from 33 to 68% across subjects. Fifty percent of subjects performed the workout at an oxygen uptake value that fell within the ACSM recommendations of 50-85% o 2 R. This variation in oxygen consumption was not explained by the variation in absolute resistance lifted, because the correlation ( r = 0.27) was low and nonsignificant. Thus, those who lifted heavier resistances did not necessarily have greater relative oxygen consumption. The correlation improved somewhat ( r = 0.50, p < 0.05) when the relative resistance lifted (% 5RM) was correlated with the % o 2 R value achieved during the CFE workout. Although it was difficult to get a meaningful assessment of maximal strength specific to the equipment used, these results suggest that the relative resistance lifted explained about 25% of the variation in the oxygen requirement of the activity. Increasing the resistance lifted has been advocated by some researchers and practitioners as a method of increasing the aerobic requirement of circuit weight training ( 5 ), although others speculate that increasing resistance is not a viable option ( 8,20 ). In the present study, the average RPE was a 6, or “somewhat hard,” on the OMNI-RES. Thus, we would caution against increasing the resistance much more because it could result in poor technique, increased injury, and decreased adherence, particularly in individuals who are new to functional resistance exercise training. Although speculative, other factors that may have contributed to the higher relative oxygen uptake values seen in half of the subjects are the amount of space covered with the movements and the extent of core musculature engagement. We noted anecdotally that subjects who used larger movements and exhibited high core engagement tended to have higher o 2 values during the workout. Because our design was limited in this aspect, future investigations should examine the impact that these factors have on oxygen consumption during functional resistance exercise. The relative and absolute oxygen uptake values from the present study are similar or slightly higher than those reported for circuit weight training ( 2,8,11,12,19 ), the closest comparable activity. No previous investigations have reported oxygen uptake values as % o 2 R, and the highest % o 2 max value found in the circuit weight training literature was 50% o 2 max ( 8 ). This value was only attained after the completion of 3 exercise circuits, so oxygen consumption earlier in the circuit weight training workout was even lower. By comparison, the relative oxygen uptake values in the present study (51% o 2 max) were achieved within the first 5 minutes of exercise and were maintained for the duration of the training session. In terms of caloric expenditure, as a group men expended more calories than women, but there was no significant difference between the sexes when caloric expenditure was expressed relative to body weight. For the group, the average caloric expenditure was 0.14 kcal·kg −1 ·min −1 , resulting in an average expenditure of approximately 289 kcal for the 28.5-minute CFE bout. The mean expenditures in kilocalories per minute for women, men, and the group were 8.3, 12.0, and 10.2, respectively. This is higher than the caloric expenditure reported in studies examining either traditional resistance exercise ( 3 ) or circuit weight training ( 2,19 ), which found energy expenditures ranging from 5 to 9 kcal·min −1 . As with oxygen uptake values, the higher energy expenditure values seen in the present study are likely related to the large amount of muscle mass involved in the functional activities. In addition, there was a modest energy contribution from anaerobic glycolysis, suggested by the post lactic acid concentration of 4.5 mmol·L −1 and the pre- to postexercise change in lactic acid concentration of 2.5 mmol·L −1 . One circuit weight training study reported post lactate values of 8.8 mM ( 8 ), and another reported a post lactate value of 17 mM ( 12 ). Although the values from the present study are lower than those from circuit weight training, the post lactate value suggests blood lactate accumulation may be elevated enough to cause some muscle discomfort. As with circuit weight training, the lactate values after CFE are likely attributable to use of small muscle groups during exercise performance. These smaller muscles typically develop a high level of intramuscular pressure, restricting blood flow and causing the active muscle to depend in part on anaerobic metabolism ( 8,11,12 ). The average percentage of HRmax achieved during the CFE workout was 83%. As in many studies examining resistance exercise and circuit weight training, the heart rate response was disproportionate to the oxygen consumption ( 2,8,11,12 ). Previous studies have attributed this elevated heart rate response during exercise engaging upper-body muscle mass to increased static muscular load, which can restrict venous return and reduce stroke volume ( 2,20 ). In this situation, heart rate may increase independently of oxygen uptake to maintain cardiac output. Approximately 95% of the exercises performed in the functional exercise workout required upper-body muscle mass to move the resistance. Thus, it is not recommended that heart rates from the CFE workout be used as valid indicators of cardiovascular intensity. In summary, the results of this investigation indicate that CFE resulted in energy expenditure, but not oxygen uptake values, which meet the ACSM recommendations. In comparison with circuit weight training, CFE elicits higher oxygen uptake and energy expenditure values. This investigation examined a single, acute bout of CFE and, thus, could not assess changes in cardiovascular fitness, muscular strength, or endurance. In addition, our study was limited in that we did not measure mode-specific maximal oxygen uptake or assess the amount of space covered or core engagement during the exercises. Future research should examine the impact that these factors may have on oxygen uptake during functional exercise and the potential benefits of chronic participation in CFE to examine the cardiovascular and muscular fitness adaptations to CFE training. A training study that evaluates potential muscular strength and endurance adaptations from traditional resistance exercise and that compares them with those from functional exercise would be very useful. Practical Applications Although the CFE workout examined in this investigation did not result in oxygen uptake values that meet ACSM recommendations for improving cardiovascular fitness, it did meet the ACSM guidelines for energy expenditure, with a mean of 289 kcal for 28.5 minutes of exercise. Thus, CFE would be a reasonable cross-training option for individuals interested in weight loss or improving their overall health, and it can offer variety in an exercise program. Personal trainers may find that offering functional exercise in this format is desirable because it can be taught as group exercise, which is preferred by some participants and can maximize profits for trainers.

PeerJ 11 : e14493 https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.14493 Abstract Background Systematic reviews and meta-analyses related to high-intensity functional training (HIFT) have been conducted. However, due to a restricted pool of available research, these investigations are often limited in scope. As such, a scoping review investigating the present literature surrounding the acute physiological response to HIFT-based exercise was chosen as a more appropriate structured review. Methodology A scoping review was conducted following Arksey and O’Malley’s framework. Three large scale databases were searched to reveal any article pertaining to HIFT and related exercise terminology. Results A total of 2,241 articles were found during the initial search. Following this, titles, then abstracts, and full-texts were reviewed to determine inclusion eligibility. A total of 60 articles which investigated a combined total of 35 unique HIFT workouts were included within this review. Conclusions A variety of physiological parameters and HIFT workouts have been examined. Markers of intensity ( e.g ., blood lactate concentrations, heart rate) have been most consistently assessed across all studies, and these support the idea that HIFT workouts are typically performed at high-intensity. In contrast, the inclusion of most other measures ( e.g ., hormonal, markers of inflammation and damage, energy expenditure, performance) has been inconsistent and has thus, limited the possibility for making generalized conclusions. Differences in study methodologies have further impacted conclusions, as different studies have varied in sample population characteristics, workouts assessed, and time points. Though it may be impossible to comprehensively research all possible HIFT workouts, consistent adoption of population definitions and workload quantification may overcome this challenge and assist with future comparisons.

PeerJ 11 : e14493 https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.14493 Main article text Introduction Over the past 50 years, a variety of high-intensity training programs have emerged to become the leading fitness trends ( Thompson, 2021 ). Though many forms exist, programming is commonly assigned at vigorous to near-maximal training intensities (≥60–90% heart rate reserve, ≥77–96% maximal heart rate) ( Liguori, 2021 ), and may be differentiated by modality, frequency, duration, rest intervals, and variation. Two noteworthy examples are high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and high-intensity functional training (HIFT) because they both encourage high-intensity effort but are characterized by different modality and work-rest parameters. HIIT involves short, high-intensity efforts separated by predefined rest periods using a single modality ( e.g ., cycling or running) ( Buchheit & Laursen, 2013 ; Buchheit & Laursen, 2013 ; Babraj et al., 2009 ; Gillen & Gibala, 2014 ), whereas HIFT variably incorporates numerous modalities ( e.g ., cycling and running, gymnastics and calisthenics, weightlifting, etc. ) and typically allows trainees to auto-regulate rest so that effort may range from continuous to intermittent ( Feito et al., 2018b ). HIFT protocols may also specify work and rest intervals at times, and when this occurs, these are referred as multimodal HIIT. Compared to traditional, moderate-intensity continuous training, HIIT, multimodal HIIT, and HIFT may be more attractive. These programs require significantly less time to elicit the same benefits and have been reported to be more enjoyable ( Gillen & Gibala, 2014 ; Ballesta-Garcia et al., 2019 ; Brito et al., 2014 ; Heinrich et al., 2014 ). However, differentiating the advantages and disadvantages among high-intensity regimens is more difficult because of their flexible programming structure. For instance, a variety of beneficial fitness adaptations have been reported following all three training forms mentioned ( Gillen & Gibala, 2014 ; Feito et al., 2018c ; Buckley et al., 2015 ; Louzada et al., 2020 ; Schaun et al., 2018 ), however, neither HIIT nor multimodal HIIT have been directly compared to HIFT. This is most likely because of the inherent differences that exist among these programming strategies. To make fair comparisons, an essential characteristic of one strategy must be sacrificed to equate workloads. Moreover, with nearly infinite possible combinations available for comparisons, numerous studies would be needed to make generalized conclusions and existing HIFT research is relatively incomplete compared to more traditional exercise forms. Thus, it is essential to begin with a clear definition of HIFT. Definition of high-intensity functional training HIFT incorporates a variety of functional, multimodal movements, intended to be performed at a relatively high-intensity to elicit improvements in general physical preparedness ( Feito et al., 2018b ). In practice, only a portion of this definition may be recognizable in daily workouts, whereas its entirety is more apparent over the course of several weeks to months of training. That is, single workouts might only address a few desired training outcomes in less than a handful of motor patterns. If viewed individually or only in the short-term ( e.g ., 1 week or month), one might conclude that relevant movement patterns and physiological traits are not being equally addressed in training. However, viewed over a longer time interval, a well-designed HIFT program should equally address all relevant motor patterns and physiological traits. Regardless of this, however, three key characteristics may be extracted from this definition that differentiate the HIFT scheme from others. These include the format or structure of workouts, the types or classification of exercises that compose workouts, and the variability in workout stimulus to promote general physical preparedness. Workout structure Workout structure is a key difference between HIFT and other types of high-intensity exercise programs. Workouts are often organized into one or more circuits of exercises with completion instructions that emphasize density ( i.e ., completing repetitions at the fastest pace possible). One common structure creates a list of exercises with specific prescription ( e.g ., loads, repetitions, durations) and has trainees repeat the list for ‘ as many repetitions as possible ’ (AMRAP) for a stated duration. Another common structure might ask trainees to complete that same list (or repeat it a specific number of times) as fast as possible and record their time to completion (TTC). The CrossFit® benchmark workouts “Cindy” and “Fran” are two of the most common workouts found within existing HIFT research ( CrossFit, 2019 ; Kliszczewicz et al., 2015 ; Zeitz et al., 2020 ; Cavedon et al., 2020 ), and they provide excellent examples of the AMRAP and TTC workout structures, respectively. “Cindy” is a 20-min AMRAP of five pull-ups, 10 push-ups, and 15 air squats ( CrossFit, 2019 ). Like most AMRAP workouts, trainees must complete all assigned repetitions for each exercise in their prescribed order before returning to the first exercise ( i.e ., five pull-ups, then 10 push-ups, and then 15 air squats before returning to pull-ups). At the end of 20 min, trainees record the total number of repetitions completed as their score. “Fran” is also a circuit, and it consists of two exercises (barbell thrusters and pull-ups) that are repeated sequentially over three rounds, where trainees progressively complete less repetitions ( i.e ., 21-15-9 repetitions) for both exercises on each round. However, instead of repeating this prescription for a specified duration, trainees are tasked with completing the 21-15-9-repetition circuit once and are scored by TTC. Other common structures include the ‘ every minute on the minute ’ (EMOM) format and an adapted Tabata-style protocol ( Viana et al., 2019 ). The EMOM structure assigns a specific number of repetitions to an exercise that must be completed within 1 min and repeats this prescription every minute for a pre-defined duration. The EMOM structure is also flexible in that interval durations are not limited to lasting 1 min only. An E2MOM repeats prescription every 2 min on the minute, whereas the prescribed repetitions of “Death by…” workouts increase the repetitions to be completed on each minute. Meanwhile, Tabata-style workouts may be viewed as a subcategory of the AMRAP structure that assign a specific exercise to be completed for ‘ as many repetitions as possible ’ within eight, consecutive 20-s rounds. Rounds are separated by 10-s rest intervals for a total duration of 4 min. While any of these and other structures may be employed, AMRAP’s and TTC’s workouts are the most common HIFT structures ( CrossFit, 2022 ; WODwell, 2022 ). Exercise selection Although many definitions exist, ‘functional’ exercises are typically whole-body movements that activate multiple muscle groups through universal motor recruitment patterns mirroring activities of daily living ( e.g ., squatting to sit on a toilet or chair, picking an object off the ground, carrying groceries to and from a vehicle, etc. ) ( Heinrich et al., 2014 ; Poston et al., 2016 ). The intention behind emphasizing functional movements is to elicit greater expressions of force and power ( CrossFit, 2002 ), which may better promote developments in neuromuscular function, muscle mass and quality, and strength compared to non-functional exercises ( Metter et al., 1997 ; Heinrich et al., 2021 ). Over the course of training, HIFT workouts may incorporate a wide array of exercises from multiple modalities that vary in ‘functional’ degree. While an exercise’s degree of function will impact its ability to stimulate adaptations ( i.e ., less functional exercises provide a lesser stimulus) ( CrossFit, 2002 ), variability in functional degree may be purposeful and based on the trainee’s skill in performing certain movement patterns and the specific goals of the workout. For example, the muscle-up exercise requires a powerful, full-body swing (or “kip”) to accelerate the trainee from a hanging position (from a pair of rings or pull-up bar) to a controlled, upright position where their arms are extended, and lower torso/hips are even with the rings or bar. The less complex segments of this exercise ( i.e ., the ‘kip’, hip pull, turnover, etc. ) reduce range of motion, musculature involved, contraction velocity, relative intensity, and work completed ( CrossFit, 2019 ), and are, thus, less functional. Nevertheless, less complex segments, or similar but less complex motions ( e.g ., pull-ups), may be programmed as learning tools or because the trainee cannot complete repetitions at the workout’s intended pace. HIFT workouts draw from a wide array of exercises that fall into one of three categories: weightlifting, gymnastics, or monostructural. In addition to its traditional definition ( i.e ., Olympic weightlifting), weightlifting exercises in HIFT refer to any exercise that uses an external load as a means of resistance ( CrossFit, 2019 ). This usually involves variations of typical Olympic weightlifting and power lifts, but also includes exercises that utilize kettlebells, dumbbells, or medicine balls. Gymnastic (and calisthenic) movements are those that utilize the trainee’s body mass as the resistance and, at times, an external object meant to serve as an obstacle. For instance, no additional equipment is needed for a “burpee” and body mass is the primary source of intensity. However, when the task is elevated to a “burpee box jump-over”, the box serves as the obstacle that the trainee may land upon or simply jump over after performing a burpee. Alternatively, pull-ups also require an external object (a hanging pull-up bar) upon which the trainee moves their body. Meanwhile, monostructural exercises refer to exercise that is continuous, repetitive, and cyclical in nature ( e.g ., rowing, running, biking, swimming, or skiing). Any combination of these three categories may appear in a single workout. Some may include only one modality whereas others may draw from two or all three modalities in equal or unequal amounts. General physical preparedness Several philosophies about progression and periodization exist within the realm of exercise prescription ( Haff, 2015a ; Haff, 2015b ). The main tenet of progression (or progressive overload) is that training must consistently challenge a targeted physiological trait to elicit continued adaptation. HIFT simultaneously allows this to occur constantly and at the trainee’s discretion ( Feito et al., 2018b ; CrossFit, 2019 ). The overloading stimulus of a workout is accomplished by its instructions ( i.e ., AMRAP or TTC) but because the trainee may auto-regulate rest intervals and is free to scale intensity, duration, and complexity, the degree of overload may range drastically. The trainee’s discretion also necessarily affects any periodization strategy that might be employed to achieve HIFT’s defining characteristic, to develop general physical preparedness. While individual workouts may be designed to only challenge one or a few targeted physiological traits, the accumulation of several workouts across training is intended to challenge and stimulate simultaneous adaptations across all areas of fitness ( e.g ., cardiorespiratory and circulatory fitness, metabolic function, neuromuscular function and quality, etc. ) and sport-specific skill ( Feito et al., 2018b ; CrossFit, 2019 ). However, because the actual stimulus of each workout is largely dependent on the trainee’s discretion of effort, the HIFT strategy would seem to fall between “no-periodization” and “non-linear periodization” classifications. HIFT is not completely devoid of periodization structure ( i.e ., no periodization), but is not a true non-linear plan either. Whereas a non-linear structure will repeat a microcycle (over several weeks to months) that consists of modulated programming variables that target multiple, related physiological traits ( Haff, 2015a ; Haff, 2015b ), HIFT aims at everything and does not repeat a specific pattern ( Feito et al., 2018b ; CrossFit, 2019 ). Rationale Since the early 2010s, studies involving HIFT-related outcomes have grown rapidly ( Feito, Brown & Olmos, 2019 ). Indeed, the scientific record has grown from less than 10 articles in 2012 to approximately 30 articles in 2015, though most of these limited their investigation to safety issues. In 2018, over 100 articles could be found, and that number doubled by 2021. While the growth of peer-reviewed evidence related to HIFT is encouraging and improves our understanding, 200 studies is a very small number for such a diverse programming strategy. Nevertheless, several recent systematic reviews have attempted to make sense of the risks and benefits associated with HIFT ( Claudino et al., 2018 ; Meyer, Morrison & Zuniga, 2017 ; Rodriguez et al., 2021 ; de Souza et al., 2021 ; Schlegel, 2020 ; Jacob et al., 2020 ; Gean, Martin & Cassat, 2020 ; Barranco-Ruiz et al., 2020 ). Systematic reviews are often conducted to “ confirm or refute a current practice based on relevant evidence, establish the quality of the evidence, and to address variation in practice ” ( Munn et al., 2018 ). However, the lack of comprehensive research on any given HIFT topic hinders this endeavor. Instead, a scoping review, which quantifies the volume of evidence on a specific topic and provides a broad or detailed overview of its focus ( Munn et al., 2018 ), may be more appropriate at this time to summarize and synthesize current evidence. Since more evidence is available about acute responses than long-term training effects ( Feito, Brown & Olmos, 2019 ) the aims of this scoping review are to (1) summarize currently available research related to HIFT and its effects on acute physiological outcomes, (2) identify research gaps, and (3) propose future research directions to continue to expand our knowledge of this training modality. The findings of this review are intended to inform scientists across a broad range of disciplines of the current standing of HIFT-related research and important methodological needs for future endeavors. Additionally, coaches, athletes, and healthy adults who participate in HIFT may find this review useful for better understanding the expected response to individual workouts. Methodology With the goal of providing a broad scope of the literature related to acute physiological responses to HIFT, the present scoping review was completed in accordance with Arksey and O’Malley’s five-stage framework ( Arksey & O’Malley, 2005 ). The following sections report this process. Stated research questions Compared to the research endeavors of more traditional exercise strategies and sports, HIFT is a relatively new topic ( Feito, Brown & Olmos, 2019 ). Programming relies on an extremely large number of possible exercise and workout structure combinations to elicit adaptations in several areas of fitness (the Level 1 Training Guide lists 10 fitness domains) ( Feito et al., 2018b ; CrossFit, 2019 ), and researchers have several objective and subjective means at their disposal to measure each of these areas. Thus, the following research questions were considered for this review: (1) What outcome variables are most often studied in HIFT literature? (2) What are the acute physiological outcomes observed as a result of a single HIFT workout? Identifying relevant studies CrossFit® Inc.’s Level 1 Training Guide proposes a theoretical template for constantly varied exercise where all modalities, physiological traits, and sport-relevant skills are sufficiently addressed over the course of training to help reduce the likelihood of neglecting specific health or fitness variables ( i.e ., those that might be neglected say, if an individual only focused on weightlifting or cardiovascular endurance) ( CrossFit, 2019 ). This template shares many similar definitions and methodological similarities to those stated for HIFT ( Feito et al., 2018b ). Because of these similarities, as well as the sheer volume of CrossFit®-affiliated training facilities worldwide, CrossFit® participants and training facilities are commonly involved within HIFT-related research ( Feito et al., 2018b ; CrossFit, 2017 ). Thus, the search terms used for this scoping review included “(CrossFit) OR (High-intensity functional training) OR (HIFT)” in the following academic databases: PubMed and ScienceDirect. These databases alone were chosen as they are both free to the public and focus on the biomedical research that was most relevant to this review. However, the initial search revealed substantially more articles than indicated in previous research ( Feito, Brown & Olmos, 2019 ), as such, the search was refined to “(CrossFit[Text Word])” OR “(High-intensity Functional Training[Text Word]) OR (HIFT[Text Word])”. The search was focused on peer-reviewed articles published between January 1 st , 2000, and July 31 st , 2022. These dates include the most current research and date back to the creation of CrossFit® in 2000 ( CrossFit, 2019 ; CrossFit, 2017 ). As the most prominent form of HIFT, it is unlikely that any research was conducted on exercise strategies that fit the definitions of HIFT or CrossFit® prior to this date ( Feito et al., 2018b ; CrossFit, 2019 ). Finally, since the acute physiological responses to exercise are likely to be altered by various illnesses and age (specifically adolescent and older adult populations), only articles that included healthy, young adults were considered.

Abstracts and Methods sections of each were reviewed to ensure that training sessions and outcome measures were in accordance with the stated definition of HIFT ( Feito et al., 2018b ) and included outcome measures immediately following an individual exercise session. Discrepancies were discussed by two authors (JMM and YF) and whenever disagreement occurred between these investigators, a third investigator was consulted (GTM). The decision to keep or discard an article was determined by the group after careful consideration of the study’s goals and the aims of this scoping review. Any study where a mutual agreement was not reached was eliminated from the sample ( n = 0). Charting the data The following information was extracted from the selected articles: author(s), year of publication, exercise protocols and key physiological findings. Descriptions of common HIFT workouts ( e.g ., benchmark and competition workouts) are available online ( CrossFit, 2022 ; WODwell, 2022 ). Uncommon workouts ( i.e ., those specifically designed for research) are described in Table 2 . Table 2: Reported high-intensity functional training sessions.

Results After refining the search and removing article duplicates ( n = 3), 2,238 articles remained. Of these, additional articles ( n = 2,112) were removed because their title indicated that they did not specifically relate to HIFT or focus on healthy, young adult populations. Abstract and full-text review, focusing on methodology, led to the removal of another 73 and 0 articles, respectively. Throughout this process, a handful of known relevant articles ( n = 7) were missed by the search and added to the final volume ( Cavedon et al., 2020 ; Adami et al., 2021 ; Ahmad, Jusoh & Tengah, 2019 ; Babiash, 2013 ; Box et al., 2018 ; Brisebois, 2014 ; Brisebois, Biggerstaff & Nichols, 2021 ; Browne et al., 2020 ; Butcher, Judd & Benko, 2015 ; Carreker & Grosicki, 2020 ; Coco et al., 2019 ; Collins & Kearns, 2020 ; Durkalec-Michalski et al., 2018 ; Durkalec-Michalski et al., 2021 ; Escobar, Morales & Vandusseldorp, 2016 ; Escobar, Morales & Vandusseldorp, 2017 ; Faelli et al., 2020 ; Falk Neto et al., 2020 ; Feito et al., 2018a ; Fernández et al., 2015 ; Fisker et al., 2017 ; Fogaça et al., 2020 ; Forte et al., 2022 ; García-Fernández et al., 2021 ; Garnacho-Castaño et al., 2020 , 2022 ; Gomes et al., 2020 ; Kliszczewicz et al., 2017 , 2018a , 2019 , 2015 , Kliszczewicz, Snarr & Esco, 2014 ; Kliszczewicz et al., 2018b , 2016 ; Kodikara, Walker & Wilson, 2021 ; Landers-Ramos et al., 2022 ; Leitão et al., 2021 ; Mangine et al., 2019 , 2018 ; Maroufi et al., 2020 ; Martínez-Gómez et al., 2022 ; Maté-Muñoz et al., 2022 , 2018 , 2017 ; Morris et al., 2019 ; Pearson et al., 2020 ; Perciavalle et al., 2016 ; Schubert & Palumbo, 2019 ; Schwarz et al., 2020 ; Shaw et al., 2015 ; Tibana et al., 2016 , 2018a , 2019a , 2018b , 2019b ; Timón et al., 2019 ; Toledo et al., 2021 ; Wilke, 2020 ; Willis et al., 2019 ; Zecchin et al., 2021 ). The total remaining articles ( n = 60) were organized into eight overarching categories based on their outcome measures ( e.g ., lactate, chronotropic, energy expenditure and oxygen consumption, hormonal, inflammatory, blood glucose, muscle and oxidative damage, and acute power output). Indicators of workout intensity Different exercise modalities affect the method used to define a workout’s intensity. The intensity of most resistance training exercises is defined by the load being lifted and its relationship to either the maximum number of repetitions the trainee can complete with that specific load or the most amount of weight they can lift in the same movement for one repetition ( Sheppard & Triplett, 2015 ). Though these methods are often used to quantify muscle strength, strength-endurance, and/or power, there are many exercises that are not amenable to this method. There is a greater influence from technique on maximal Olympic weightlifting loads compared to, say, the power lifts ( e.g ., back squats, deadlifts, and presses). Meanwhile, it is highly uncommon, too variable, or even unsafe to quantify maximal repetitions or loads for other exercises that fall into this category ( e.g ., assistance exercises, kettlebell swings, wall ball shots). Likewise, the intensity of many gymnastic movements prescribed during HIFT is not easily quantified. Individual body mass is often the load being lifted, and strength matters, but the trainee’s technical skill in performing the movement is extremely influential. Individuals who lack the skill or do not perform a specific movement efficiently will experience additional strain, put forth more effort, and complete more work ( McGinnis, 2020 ). Since a HIFT workout may contain one or more of either of these modalities, researchers have often settled on quantifying intensity via traditional objective ( e.g ., lactate concentrations, heart rate, oxygen consumption) or subjective ( e.g ., ratings of perceived exertion) cardiorespiratory exercise metrics ( Reuter & Jj, 2016 ). Though it is unknown how weightlifting intensity loads and gymnastic movement difficulty play into an overall workout’s intensity, using cardiorespiratory metrics seem to best summarize this characteristic. To maintain consistency with the scope of this review, this section will focus on objective, physiological indicators of HIFT workout intensity. Blood lactate During exercise, the point at which lactate begins accumulating faster than the body is able to remove, or clear it, is referred to as the lactate threshold ( Faude, Kindermann & Meyer, 2009 ). The lactate threshold within trained and untrained populations is commonly associated with approximately 85% of one’s maximal heart rate (HRmax) and is described as the point at which exercise intensity progresses from moderate ( i.e ., below lactate threshold) to vigorous ( i.e ., greater than lactate threshold) ( Foster, Fitzgerald & Spatz, 1999 ; Messonnier et al., 2013 ). Although the acute exercise bouts varied greatly, lactate concentrations immediately following exercise were either on par with, or even greater than that of commonly used maximal aerobic capacity ( i.e ., ≥8–10 millimoles per liter) and Wingate anaerobic (~13–15 millimoles per liter) testing criteria ( Ahmad, Jusoh & Tengah, 2019 ; Babiash, 2013 ; Collins & Kearns, 2020 ; Escobar, Morales & Vandusseldorp, 2016 , 2017 ; Falk Neto et al., 2020 ; Feito et al., 2018a ; Fernández et al., 2015 ; Gomes et al., 2020 ; Kliszczewicz et al., 2017 , 2018a , 2018b ; Perciavalle et al., 2016 ; Tibana et al., 2016 , 2018a , 2019a , 2018b ; Timón et al., 2019 ; Toledo et al., 2021 ; Mate-Munoz et al., 2017 , 2018 ; Öztürk, Özer & Gökçe, 1998 ; Vincent et al., 2004 ). Of articles reporting lactate concentrations, two reported values outside of the expected range for vigorous exercise ( Coco et al., 2019 ; Shaw et al., 2015 ). Shaw et al. (2015) observed a 170% increase in lactate concentrations, though raw concentrations ( i.e ., average pre- to post-exercise lactate increased from 2.20 to 5.95 millimoles per liter) were much lower than all other studies reviewed. Previous research indicates that a lower lactate response to exercise may be expected in untrained individuals compared to their trained counterparts of the same age group ( Silverman & Mazzeo, 1996 ). Because greater lactate concentrations are expected with greater exercise intensities ( Lagally et al., 2002 ), the lower concentrations observed by Shaw et al. (2015) are likely the consequence of a sedentary population with no HIFT experience being assigned low intensity exercises ( i.e ., burpees, push-ups, and bodyweight squats) for a relatively short duration ( i.e ., a 10-min AMRAP). A similar explanation might account for the slightly higher, but still lower than expected concentrations ( i.e ., peak of 6.34 millimoles per liter) reported by Coco et al. (2019) following a workout (CrossFit® Open workout 15.5) that included thrusters (95 lbs.) and calorie rowing. Though participants were considered professional bodybuilders, they were naïve to HIFT, and that lack of experience may have necessitated familiarization trials. This possibility remains unclear because the authors did not report workout performance, which could have been used to provide some indication of their percentile rank in the workout. For instance, the lower lactate concentrations combined with a higher percentile rank might have suggested that the workout did not represent a challenge. Afterall, they would likely have been accustomed to completing workouts involving several lifts using moderate-to-high volume loads for several sets and short rest intervals ( Sheppard & Triplett, 2015 ; Ratamess et al., 2009 ). Unfortunately, a description of participant training history was also neglected in this study. Nevertheless, it seems reasonable to hypothesize that the lack of participant HIFT experience was responsible for the lower lactate concentrations observed in these two studies ( Coco et al., 2019 ; Shaw et al., 2015 ) compared to others ( Escobar, Morales & Vandusseldorp, 2016 ; Fernández et al., 2015 ; Kliszczewicz et al., 2017 ; Perciavalle et al., 2016 ; Tibana et al., 2018b ). This idea is supported by differential lactate responses ( i.e ., 10 millimoles per liter) by less skilled participants who performed the workout “Fran” in a scaled manner ( i.e ., utilizing assistance during the pull-up repetitions) compared to a 50% greater elevation in lactate concentrations ( i.e ., +15 millimoles per liter) among those who performed the workout as prescribed ( Babiash, 2013 ; Tibana et al., 2018b ). The remaining articles report lactate values reaching ≥13.3–18.9 millimoles per liter (~200–700% change) following eleven unique HIFT workouts ( Fernández et al., 2015 ; Kliszczewicz et al., 2017 ; Perciavalle et al., 2016 ; Tibana et al., 2019a , 2018b ; Timón et al., 2019 ; Toledo et al., 2021 ; Forte et al., 2022 ). All workouts included at least one weightlifting exercise except for the study by Fernández et al. (2015) , which used the bodyweight workout “Cindy”. The greatest lactate responses were 17.8, 18.4, and 18.9 millimoles per liter following three workouts comprised of different modality combinations ( i.e ., weightlifting and gymnastic exercises, multiple weightlifting exercises, compared to a combination of weightlifting, gymnastics, and monostructural, respectively) and durations ( i.e ., 4.1, 8.9, and 20 min, respectively) ( Tibana et al., 2019a , 2018b ; Timón et al., 2019 ), which led to three different pacing ( i.e ., repetitions per second) strategies. Participants completed the shortest workout ( i.e ., “Fran”) at a pace of 0.36 repetitions per second, the 8.9-min workout at 0.22 repetitions per second, and the 20-min workout at 0.17 repetitions per second. These reports collectively ( Fernández et al., 2015 ; Kliszczewicz et al., 2017 ; Perciavalle et al., 2016 ; Tibana et al., 2019a , 2018b ; Timón et al., 2019 ; Toledo et al., 2021 ; Forte et al., 2022 ) suggest that, regardless of workout composition, higher lactate concentrations may be expected in experienced HIFT trainees than what would be expected from maximal testing in young, apparently healthy adults ( Edvardsen, Hem & Anderssen, 2014 ). Chronotropic responses Thirty-one articles describing the chronotropic (or heart rate) response to HIFT were identified. Among these, exercise intensity loads ranged from “low” ( i.e ., bodyweight only) ( Kliszczewicz, Snarr & Esco, 2014 ) to “high” (>100 kg) ( Box et al., 2018 ) for short ( Tibana et al., 2018b ) (<5 min) to long (35 min) durations ( Browne et al., 2020 ), and comprised of only a single ( Kliszczewicz et al., 2017 ) to multiple (5+) exercises ( Durkalec-Michalski et al., 2021 ). Despite large variations in workout programming characteristics, heart rate responses typically fell within the “vigorous intensity” category ( i.e ., between 77% and 95% of HRmax) ( Liguori, 2021 ), though two investigations reported responses within the “light to moderate” range ( i.e ., <65% HRmax) ( Shaw et al., 2015 ; Timón et al., 2019 ). These findings might be explained by the duration (5–10 min) of workouts entirely composed of low-intensity, low-complexity calisthenic exercises ( i.e ., burpees, push-ups, air squats, toes-to-bar). However, they contrast the heart rates (85–90% HRmax) reported by Butcher, Judd & Benko (2015) at 5 and 10 min into a 20-min workout of similar intensity-exercise composition ( i.e ., “Cindy”) in both novice and experienced trainees. It is possible that differences in participant HIFT experience, which varied from no experience and 6 months sedentary ( Shaw et al., 2015 ) to 1–8 months for “novice” ( Butcher, Judd & Benko, 2015 ) to >12 months ( Timón et al., 2019 ) to >18 months for “experienced” ( Butcher, Judd & Benko, 2015 ), could partially explain these discrepancies in conjunction with the pacing strategy allowed by workout composition. Novice (19.5 repetitions per minute) and experienced participants (23.5 repetitions per minute) averaged a faster pace over the 20-min workout completed in the study by Butcher, Judd & Benko (2015) than those in the 5 min workout (18.3 repetitions per minute) examined by Timón et al. (2019) . In the latter study, the workout used an ascending repetition ladder scheme (1-1, 2-2, 3-3, …) for two exercises (burpees and toes-to-bar). Compared to the longer sets of “Cindy” ( i.e ., 5, 10, and 15 repetitions), more time must be spent transitioning between exercises during the early rounds, as few participants would have exceeded seven repetitions in any set (average AMRAP score was 91.4 repetitions) ( Timón et al., 2019 ). While Shaw et al. (2015) did not report performance scores, the assigned triplet of three burpees, four push-ups, and five body squats would have also led to more frequent transitions and less fatigue on any set. Thus, the combination of experience, low-intensity/complexity programming, and slower pacing may explain the blunted heart rate responses seen in these two outlier studies. Heart rate variability (HRV) is another metric that may be simultaneously collected while assessing the heart rate response to HIFT. As an indicator of autonomic control ( Acharya et al., 2006 ), it is less relevant to a single workout’s intensity and more relevant to the trainee’s cumulative response to training. That is, whenever a trainee performs multiple workouts within a single training session or completes sessions on consecutive days, their autonomic response may be a useful indicator of readiness, which could impact the intensity of an upcoming workout. Thus far, three studies have reported the HRV response to HIFT ( Kliszczewicz et al., 2018b ; Kliszczewicz et al., 2016 ; Mangine et al., 2019 ); covering five unique workouts in total. As expected, root mean squares of successive normal-to-normal differences (RMSSD; reported as lnRMSSD) was depressed by nearly 50% following each workout ( Kliszczewicz et al., 2018b ; Kliszczewicz et al., 2016 ; Mangine et al., 2019 ), but methodological differences in post-exercise time points cloud any conclusions about recovery. For instance, lnRMSSD remained depressed for 1 h after “Cindy”, but because it was not tracked after 60 min, it is unknown when values returned to baseline ( Kliszczewicz et al., 2016 ). In a later study, nearly identical patterns were noted following both “Grace” and a 15-min AMRAP comprised of rowing, kettlebell swings, and dumbbell thrusters ( Kliszczewicz et al., 2018b ). lnRMSSD remained depressed 45 min post-exercise and returned to baseline at 2 h, leaving whatever happened in the interim unknown. Likewise, Mangine et al. (2019) reported similar patterns where lnRMSSD remained depressed for 30 min following CrossFit® Open workouts 16.3 and 16.4. These two comparative studies suggest autonomic function may be expected to return to baseline within 45- and 120-min post-exercise following HIFT workouts. However, there are currently too many differences between studies to make this hypothesis. Kliszczewicz et al. (2018b) required participants to possess only 3 months of HIFT experience, complete all workouts in the morning, and in a laboratory setting. In contrast, Mangine et al. (2019) recruited participants with at least 2 years of HIFT experience and tracked HRV within a competitive setting at a time similar to when they normally trained. With the nature of competition ( i.e ., setting, opponent quality, provocation) being known to affect anxiety and the autonomic nervous system compared to normal training ( Casto & Edwards, 2016 ; Kivlighan & Granger, 2006 ; Kraemer & Ratamess, 2005 ), it is clear that few fair comparisons can be made at this time. More research is needed using similar methods before generalized conclusions are possible. Biochemical responses A limited number of studies have examined hormonal responses to HIFT ( Faelli et al., 2020 ; Gomes et al., 2020 ; Kliszczewicz et al., 2018a ; Kliszczewicz et al., 2018b ; Kliszczewicz et al., 2016 ; Mangine et al., 2019 ; Mangine et al., 2018 ; Tibana et al., 2019b ). Collectively, they report on changes in a handful of hormones following a variety of workouts within vaguely described populations. Thus, a major gap still exists in our understanding of both the acute and long-term effects of HIFT on human physiology. An acute bout of HIFT, like any workout, may be characterized by the manipulation of its programming variables ( e.g ., intensity, volume, density, etc. ) to produce a stimulus that ultimately may lead to adaptations ( Ratamess et al., 2009 ). An effective stimulus is one that exceeds the individual’s current ability to meet its imposed demands ( Ratamess et al., 2009 ). Hormones respond to the stimulus to assist in meeting metabolic demands, restoring homeostasis, achieving steady state, and/or facilitating tissue repair. The extent of the response is dictated by a variety of factors that include, among others, the individual’s age, sex, fitness level, training status, nutritional and hydration status, and the nature ( e.g ., relative difficulty, novelty, context, etc. ) of the training stimulus ( Kraemer & Ratamess, 2005 ; Kraemer, Ratamess & Nindl, 2017 ). How each individual hormone responds only represents a portion of the complex, integrated response by the entire endocrine and related physiological systems ( Kraemer & Ratamess, 2005 ; Kraemer, Ratamess & Nindl, 2017 ). In this regard, the current state of HIFT research has yet to reach its infancy. Still, there is enough information to begin forming basic expectations and pose questions for future research. Catecholamines The duration of a typical HIFT workout can be as short as <2 min to longer than 1 h, though most are shorter in duration. This means that glucose and glycogen will be the most prominent energy sources ( Harris et al., 1976 ; Essen-Gustavsson & Tesch, 1990 ; Cairns, 2006 ). Since glucose and glycogen are limited in supply and are needed for functions other than workout performance, the initial hormone response primarily is aimed at maintaining blood glucose concentrations by facilitating lipolysis and blocking glucose’s entry into the cell ( Kraemer & Ratamess, 2005 ; Kraemer, Ratamess & Nindl, 2017 ). The most immediate effect is accomplished by the fast-acting catecholamines, epinephrine (E) and norepinephrine (NE). Following HIFT workouts lasting 3–20 min, consistent elevations in E and NE have been observed immediately post-exercise before returning to pre-exercise concentrations within 1 h ( Kliszczewicz et al., 2018b , 2016 ; Mangine et al., 2019 ). In the earliest of these studies ( Kliszczewicz et al., 2016 ), well-trained men completed “Cindy” and a matched-duration (20 min) treadmill run. There was also an attempt to match intensity by having participants run at a pace equal to 85% maximal heart rate ( i.e ., the expected heart rate achieved in “Cindy” during pilot work), but ultimately, greater heart rates and perceived effort were noted throughout the HIFT workout. Accordingly, E and NE concentrations were 150% and 94% greater immediately following “Cindy” than concentrations following the treadmill bout, and they remained higher than treadmill bout concentrations for 1-h post-exercise. As of yet, it remains unclear whether these responses were due to the slight differences in exercising heart rate (“Cindy” = 93–98% maximal heart rate; treadmill = 89–94% maximal heart rate) or possibly the frequent changes in body position required by the HIFT workout ( i.e ., lowering to floor, jumping to pull-up bar, etc. ) compared to the consistent body position of treadmill running ( CrossFit, 2019 ). Regardless, this has been the only study to compare the catecholamine response during HIFT to a more traditional exercise modality. Some important considerations for making conclusions about the hormone response to any HIFT workout include the individual’s ability to auto-regulate pace ( e.g ., rest breaks within a set, speed of transition between exercises, etc. ), the modifications available for exercise intensity and complexity, and HIFT’s competitive aspects. In a pair of follow-up studies ( Kliszczewicz et al., 2018b ; Mangine et al., 2019 ), catecholamine responses were compared between two HIFT workouts completed in a laboratory setting ( Kliszczewicz et al., 2018b ) and two other workouts completed in a competitive setting ( Mangine et al., 2019 ). Within the laboratory, similar elevations in E (~450%) and NE (~600%) were seen immediately following “Grace” (3.4 ± 1.0 min) and an AMRAP session containing multiple exercise modalities (15 min), and these returned to pre-exercise concentrations within an hour. Although the catecholamine responses to these markedly different workouts were the same, concentrations were 88–93% less than those previously reported after “Cindy” ( Kliszczewicz et al., 2016 ). The most obvious explanation would be that two different studies used two different groups of people. Hormone responses are highly individualistic ( Beaven, Gill & Cook, 2008 ; Alen et al., 1988 ; Jensen et al., 1991 ), and though each of these HIFT studies required similar experience (≥3 months of HIFT), there were different skill-based qualifications. The former study ( Kliszczewicz et al., 2016 ) enrolled men and women who could complete at least 14 and 10 rounds of “Cindy”, respectively, and they ultimately averaged 21.5 rounds. The requirements for the later study ( Kliszczewicz et al., 2018b ) involved being able to row on an ergometer, perform kettlebell swings and dumbbell thrusters, and complete “Grace” within 5 min, and these men also outperformed this final inclusion requirement. Thus, there is little to go on to compare these two samples. Only anecdotal evidence exists about what is considered good for “Cindy” and the observed scores for “Grace” suggest that the sample was representative of the 40 th percentile in that specific workout ( Mangine, Cebulla & Feito, 2018 ). Differences in workout duration and pacing could also be responsible. The highest concentrations were seen with the longest workout ( i.e ., “Cindy”), but the factors influencing the extent of the catecholamine response are not limited to exercise duration ( Kraemer & Ratamess, 2005 ). Muscle activation, force of contraction, volume completed, and rest intervals also matter, and the similar responses seen with “Grace” and a longer (15-min AMRAP) workout do not support any obvious patterns except, possibly the degree to which workout density involved intermittent vs . continuous work ( i.e ., pace or repetitions per minute or second). “Cindy” does not require much space and the only necessary equipment is a bar to perform pull-ups. This provides a better opportunity for the individual to minimize time between exercises than say, the components of the 15-min AMRAP. Indeed, participants completed one repetition every 1.86 s during “Cindy” compared to every 3.28 s during the longer workout. Meanwhile, “Grace” does not involve exercise transitions, only auto-regulated breaks. Still, the slowest rate ( i.e ., one repetition every 6.88 s) was seen during “Grace”, and likely because 30 clean and jerks at higher intensity loads costs more energy than what was programmed in the other workouts. In addition to regulating pace, participants in the most recent investigation on the catecholamine response to HIFT were given the choice of completing the prescribed ( i.e ., Rx) or scaled version of two workouts, and these were completed alongside other members of their normal training facility ( Mangine et al., 2019 ). Immediately following CrossFit® Open workout 16.3, Mangine et al. (2019) observed an elevation in E (92 ± 113%) before it returned to pre-exercise concentrations within 30 min 1 week later, pre-exercise E and NE concentrations were 306% and 550% greater than the previous week, and these were further elevated 77% and 326% after 16.4 and remained elevated for an hour. Although greater duration and intensity are the most obvious reasons for 16.4’s elevated response ( Kraemer & Ratamess, 2005 ), the relative difficulty of each workout would still have been dependent on the individual’s ability to perform specific movements ( i.e ., muscle-ups or handstand push-ups) or lift prescribed loads. This is further complicated because the physiological impact of scaling a routine for these reasons has yet to be investigated, and there is no commonly accepted method for equating different HIFT workouts. The only element that remains consistent across any HIFT workout is that completing work as quickly as possible is typically the objective, which then might be used as a surrogate for equating effort. Still, without knowing how effort and pacing might change with modified exercises and loads, using workout difficulty to explain these differences is heavily subjective. It is also important to acknowledge the potential impact from accumulated stress and fatigue leading up to the third and fourth workouts of a 5-week, five-workout competition ( Casto & Edwards, 2016 ; Kivlighan & Granger, 2006 ; Kraemer & Ratamess, 2005 ). Unfortunately, the lack of a baseline or analysis surrounding the first two workouts eliminates the possibility of observing this effect. Nevertheless, the need to examine cumulative physiological effects of multi-week HIFT competitions is further highlighted by the observed E and NE concentrations being higher than those previously reported ( Kliszczewicz et al., 2018b ; Kliszczewicz et al., 2016 ). Aside from the uncertainty introduced by workout variations and the multi-week competition, sample characteristics may yet again provide a valid explanation for why 16.3 and 16.4 elicited the highest catecholamine concentrations. These participants needed to have at least 2 years of HIFT experience and those who competed in Rx ( i.e ., completed workout as prescribed with no scaling) ranked between the 57 th and 85 th percentiles for 16.3, and between the 52 nd and 90 th percentiles for 16.4; rankings that also include three and four women athletes who elected to scale workouts 16.3 and 16.4, respectively ( i.e ., placing them below all Rx athletes). This was only the sixth year of the CrossFit® Open competition and little was (and still is) known about the factors that influence progression into subsequent rounds. Anecdotally, it is widely held that an athlete’s final ranking in a workout can be drastically improved by completing just a few additional repetitions or finishing it just a few seconds faster. Regardless of whether these provide an average-to-above average competitor with a realistic chance to progress in the competition, it may impact the importance they place on their performance. It is possible that anticipation or a degree of self-imposed pressure to succeed and/or outperform other members of their gym may have led to an elevated autonomic response ( Casto & Edwards, 2016 ; Kivlighan & Granger, 2006 ; Kraemer & Ratamess, 2005 ; Mauger, 2014 ; Skorski et al., 2015 ) compared to what was seen in a non-competitive, laboratory setting ( Kliszczewicz et al., 2018b ; Kliszczewicz et al., 2016 ). Anabolic and catabolic hormones While catecholamines provide a more immediate effect on the mobilization of substrates, a more delayed effect, most relevant to sustained activity and recovery, may be expected from cortisol (C) and growth hormone (GH) ( Kraemer & Ratamess, 2005 ; Kraemer, Ratamess & Nindl, 2017 ). Both are thought to assist in maintaining blood glucose concentrations by blocking its entry into muscle and facilitating lipolysis, but C will also promote protein catabolism for gluconeogenesis ( Kraemer & Ratamess, 2005 ; Kraemer, Ratamess & Nindl, 2017 ); GH does not ( Cameron et al., 1988 ; Fryburg, Gelfand & Barrett, 1991 ). Further, their effects are not immediately realized because C must first enter the cell and interact with its nucleus, and GH must bind to a GH-specific binding protein to extend its relatively short half-life and enhance its effect ( Kraemer & Ratamess, 2005 ; Kraemer, Ratamess & Nindl, 2017 ). Otherwise, many of its effects particularly those related to muscle growth, are mediated by insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) ( Roith et al., 2001 ; Mauras & Haymond, 2005 ; Walenkamp & Wit, 2007 ). Another relevant hormone, testosterone (T), also responds to exercise to help prepare skeletal muscle for physical activity, mediate skeletal muscle protein synthesis and repair, limit protein catabolism, replenish metabolic substrates, and restore neuromuscular function ( Kraemer & Ratamess, 2005 ; Kraemer, Ratamess & Nindl, 2017 ). Like C, it is traditionally understood that T must enter the muscle cell and interact with the nucleus to exert its effects ( Vingren et al., 2010 ; Sinha-Hikim et al., 2004 ), though this may not always be necessary to be influential ( Estrada et al., 2003 ; Hamdi & Mutungi, 2010 ). Nevertheless, its interaction and/or competition with C throughout this process ( Viau, 2002 ; Chen et al., 1997 ; Crowley & Matt, 1996 ) is of interest. When concentrations of C are greater than T, it is thought that the individual is in a more catabolic state whereas the reverse is considered more anabolic. Consequently, the testosterone-to-cortisol (TC) ratio is often used as a basic gauge of anabolic status and indicator of a positive or negative response to external stress ( Adlercreutz et al., 1986 ). Exercise protocols that produce higher concentrations of blood lactate ( e.g ., higher volume loads with shorter rest intervals) have been well documented to elicit greater responses from C and GH ( Kraemer & Ratamess, 2005 ; Kraemer, Ratamess & Nindl, 2017 ). Although individual effort and self-regulation influence the stress of each workout, a typical HIFT session can be equated to a high-volume, short-rest resistance exercise session due to common programming directives ( i.e ., AMRAP and TTC). These essentially maximize workout session density and therefore, should elicit responses from C and GH. Indeed, all four of the studies that have investigated C within the context of HIFT have reported significant elevations ( Faelli et al., 2020 ; Gomes et al., 2020 ; Mangine et al., 2018 ; Tibana et al., 2019b ), as did the only study to monitor GH ( Kliszczewicz et al., 2018a ). Faelli et al. (2020) reported greater elevations in C following a 1-h, AMRAP-style HIFT session (+300%) compared to a decrease in C after a high-volume, short rest ( i.e ., 15RM, 1-min rest intervals) resistance exercise session (−25%). Then as expected, the response was diminished after 8 weeks of training using similar but progressive programming, though the HIFT protocol still elicited greater concentrations. However, these results should be viewed as preliminary. The participants were only described as having 1 year of resistance training or HIFT experience, the training sessions do not appear to have been equated in any way besides both being three 1-h sessions per week, and their practical relevance is questionable. For instance, while the resistance exercise program progressed intensity and volume regularly (every 2 weeks), it did not target muscle groups (besides abdominal exercises) on more than one session per week and was predominantly comprised of assistance exercises. At best, this design might be sufficient to stimulate adaptations for novice trainees but not those with moderate experience ( Haff, 2015a ; Sheppard & Triplett, 2015 ), as described by the authors. The suitability of the HIFT sessions were equally questionable due to monotonous programming and limited progression. Outside of the only progressive element ( i.e ., an increase in percent intensity load after 4 weeks), participants were simply instructed to complete ‘ as many repetitions as possible ’ of the exact same exercises, within the same time intervals, across all 8 weeks of training. This, by definition ( Feito et al., 2018b ; CrossFit, 2019 ), is not consistent with HIFT, which promotes constant variation in programming. Thus, it remains unclear as to whom these results are most applicable and whether they would hold up in a fair comparison. In a later study examining the effect of training experience on the physiological response to “Cindy” ( Gomes et al., 2020 ), members from the same training facility were split into experienced (28.5 ± 6.4 months) and novice (6.0 ± 1.5 months) groups, based on how long they had been participating in HIFT. Greater elevations in C were seen immediately following the workout and up to 30 min post-exercise in the experienced group, but no differences were seen in the heart rate achieved, changes in blood lactate concentrations, or the participants’ perceived effort. This contradicts the expectation of novice trainees being more sensitive to the workout’s stress due to their assumed lack of training and familiarity ( Kraemer & Ratamess, 2005 ; Kraemer, Ratamess & Nindl, 2017 ). While the authors’ explanation that the additional work completed by the experienced group was responsible for the greater C response has merit, that work does not necessarily equate to a greater training stress. In fact, when perceived effort was made relevant to rounds completed ( i.e ., effort per round), the novice group reported working much harder. Furthermore, the experienced group possessed greater strength (in the deadlift), repeat sprinting ability ( via yo-yo recovery test level 1), and lower body fat percentage. Each of these, in some capacity, provide evidence of each individual repetition and round representing a lesser percentage of the experienced group’s maximal capability ( i.e ., a lower physiological stress), which should equate to a reduced C response ( Kraemer & Ratamess, 2005 ; Kraemer, Ratamess & Nindl, 2017 ). That is, it is possible that the amount of work completed by the experienced group was proportional to their physiological advantages over the novice group. However, this speculation is based upon an overall rating of effort divided by rounds completed, and is thus, an estimated average that also assumes consistent effort was given throughout the workout. The actual physiological cost of each round, and how this cost may have varied, changed, and/or accumulated from round-to-round, remains unknown. Not knowing the actual progression of effort and stress across the workout leaves open the possibility for other factors to have been at work. For example, the experienced group may have benefited from further developed (or more practiced) skills related to pacing and movement efficiency ( e.g ., pace consistency, wasted movements, planned vs . unplanned rest, seamless transitions, etc. ). A more strategic and efficient approach would artificially reduce the physiological cost of each repetition and round, and therefore allow a greater amount of work to be completed within the same duration. Alternatively, poorly devised strategies ( e.g ., pacing that is overly aggressive, conservative, or unplanned) can either hasten the onset of fatigue and/or limit performance ( Mauger, 2014 ; Skorski et al., 2015 ). In either case, possessing a greater amount of training experience should provide adequate opportunities to improve fitness and learn strategies that guard against the premature onset of fatigue, but these cannot be assumed. Indeed, the “well-trained” men who completed “Cindy” for the study by Kliszczewicz et al. (2016) averaged 6.4 more rounds (or approximately 192 more repetitions) than the “experienced” trainees from Gomes et al. (2020) , and they were only described as having at least 3 months of HIFT experience. Even Kliszczewicz, Snarr & Esco (2014) pilot sample, which had the same experience requirement but also included women, averaged 2.7 more rounds (or 81 more repetitions). All these suggest that HIFT experience alone is probably not sufficient to describe training status because it does not account for the quality of training or experiences and skills learned prior to HIFT. Therefore, without a more detailed description, making fair comparisons across HIFT samples and workouts is quite difficult. Currently, cross-over designed studies appear to offer the best information about differential hormone responses. Within a series completed by Kliszczewicz et al. (2018a , 2019 , 2018b) using 40 th percentile (in “Grace”) men, one study compared the responses of growth biomarkers ( i.e ., GH, IGF-1) following “Grace” and a 15-min AMRAP containing, low-intensity load exercises of varying modalities ( Kliszczewicz et al., 2018a ). Interestingly, despite being different in duration, both workouts produced similar elevations in blood lactate, but the GH response was greater, more rapid, and better sustained following the 15-min AMRAP. However, neither workout elicited a significant response from IGF-1 or its binding proteins (1 and 2). Typically, higher concentrations of blood lactate are accompanied by elevated GH and C ( Kraemer & Ratamess, 2005 ; Kraemer, Ratamess & Nindl, 2017 ) to address the metabolic demands of exercise. Though it is odd that the GH responses were not consistent with associated lactate responses, pacing may have again been involved. Repetition completion rate during the longer workout was more than double that of “Grace”, and “Grace” lasted about one-third of the duration. Unfortunately, there is no way to contextualize these findings because no other studies have measured GH or IGF-1 in response to HIFT workouts. The two remaining studies that examined hormonal responses to HIFT limited their focus to T and C responses within a competitive setting ( Mangine et al., 2018 ; Tibana et al., 2019b ). During the 2016 CrossFit® Open, Mangine et al. (2018) monitored changes in salivary concentrations of T, C, and TC prior to and following exercise on each week of the 5-week competition. Although T and C concentrations generally remained consistent prior to exercise, C concentrations were lower than all other weeks prior to exercise on week 5 ( i.e ., workout 16.5). Since this was the only workout that was completed at a nighttime “release event”, those values can likely be attributed to diurnal variations ( Veldhuis et al., 1989 ). Still, TC remained steady prior to exercise on each week. This was an important observation because participants in this competition can repeat workouts as many times as needed to produce their best score within each week’s 4-day window, and they continued to participate in normal training throughout the week. The increased effort associated with competition and potentially higher volume load from repeated attempts over 5 weeks might be considered a period of overreaching or indicative of overtraining, as a large decline (~30%) in TC occurred ( Adlercreutz et al., 1986 ). While that did not happen in these recreational athletes, monitoring the effect of training during competition on TC is still an important question that warrants investigation in more competitive populations. The same investigation also noted similar elevations in C immediately following each workout, but different time courses for recovery ( Mangine et al., 2018 ). A more rapid recovery was seen with the two shortest workouts (16.2 and 16.3), but this would have been expected ( Kraemer & Ratamess, 2005 ). Meanwhile, T also responded to each workout except for the first week (16.1). This was interesting because T has been shown to respond to a multitude of program designs ( Kraemer & Ratamess, 2005 ; Kraemer, Ratamess & Nindl, 2017 ), as long as “overload” is present ( Ahtiainen et al., 2003 ; Hooper et al., 2017 ; McCaulley et al., 2009 ; Kraemer et al., 1990 ). Although 16.1 was completed as part of an actual competition, it is possible that the design of the workout lacked an “overloading” quality for those specific participants within the context of the study. It was the first workout of the competition and study, and data was only collected on each participant’s first attempt on any workout to limit the influence of familiarity on hormone responses. Moreover, several of the women in the study chose to complete the scaled version, which reduced the intensity load by ~50%. It is unknown how either load ( i.e ., Rx or scaled) compared to the participants’ maximal strength or whether scaling was even necessary, but the only usable indicator of relative difficulty was the C response and it, along with repetitions completed, did not appear to be affected by scaling. Without a more concrete metric of relative intensity or difficulty, the reason for the lack of a T response remains unclear. That said, relative intensity appears to be less of a consideration for designing HIFT workouts compared to maximizing workout density ( i.e ., completing work as fast as possible or maximizing repetitions in a specific time limit). In this regard, a typical or even competitive HIFT workout seems more likely to transiently affect C than T. This hypothesis was partially supported by Tibana et al. (2019b) , who monitored T and C at 24-, 48-, and 72-h after a 3-day HIFT competition. The only changes observed were reductions in T (free and total) and C at 48-h with no effect on TC. Reasons for this reduction were not put forth and are difficult to ascertain from the information provided. The 3-day competition included five workouts that were completed by participants as members of 3-person teams. Though the contributions of team members on each workout were adequately described, the relative effort put forth and resultant performances were omitted. Additionally, the participants’ physical activity post-competition and diet (aside from maintaining “normal” diet) are not clear. Nevertheless, T and C returned to normal the following day, and these two investigations ( Mangine et al., 2018 ; Tibana et al., 2019b ) provide little indication that severe changes in anabolic status should be expected following a 3-day or 5-week HIFT competition. Inflammatory markers The mechanical and metabolic stresses experienced by skeletal muscle during exercise are known to trigger an inflammatory response both during exercise and the subsequent recovery period ( Ellingsgaard, Hojman & Pedersen, 2019 ; Petersen & Pedersen, 2005 ). The implications of increased cytokine concentrations, however, are different depending on whether the inflammation is acute or chronic in nature ( Petersen & Pedersen, 2005 ). As such, a broad understanding of the inflammatory cytokine cascade is needed, though an exhaustive review of the inflammatory response to exercise is beyond the scope of this analysis (for further information, see: ( Petersen & Pedersen, 2005 ; Calle & Fernandez, 2010 )). Briefly, the inflammatory cytokine cascade is initiated with the release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin 1β (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) ( Petersen & Pedersen, 2005 ). These two cytokines will initiate the production and release of the pleiotropic cytokine, IL-6, which can be viewed as both a pro-inflammatory cytokine and an anti-inflammatory myokine ( Ellingsgaard, Hojman & Pedersen, 2019 ; Petersen & Pedersen, 2005 ; Steensberg et al., 2000 ), which, in turn will result in increased concentrations of IL-10 and IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) as well as a delayed increase in C-Reactive Protein (CRP) about 24 h later ( Steensberg et al., 2003 ). IL-10 and IL-1ra will then suppress the actions of TNFα and IL-1β, aiding in the resolution of the overall inflammatory response ( Petersen & Pedersen, 2005 ). The functions of CRP, however, are less clear as both pro- and anti-inflammatory actions have been linked to increased CRP concentrations, and the inflammatory profile is likely dependent on the predominant isoform in circulation ( Sproston & Ashworth, 2018 ). The source of IL-6 release appears to be the primary indicator of whether IL-6 functions in a pro- or anti-inflammatory role ( Ellingsgaard, Hojman & Pedersen, 2019 ; Petersen & Pedersen, 2005 ). Though IL-6 has historically been viewed as a pro-inflammatory cytokine, within the context of exercise, IL-6 likely produces anti-inflammatory effects ( Petersen & Pedersen, 2005 ; Pedersen & Bruunsgaard, 2003 ). IL-6 is released from skeletal muscle as a direct consequence of contraction ( Steensberg et al., 2000 ), thus, within the context of the cytokine cascade, acute exercise likely bypasses the initial TNFα and IL-1β response, owing to the anti-inflammatory effects of exercise ( Petersen & Pedersen, 2005 ). Moreover, the IL-6 response to exercise is augmented by glycogen depletion ( Steensberg et al., 2001 ), and as such, exercise duration has historically been identified as the primary driver of IL-6 release ( Fischer, 2006 ). Recent evidence, however, indicates a temporal relation between lactate and IL-6 concentrations ( Hojman et al., 2019 ), indicating exercise intensity is also a stimulator of IL-6, though to a lesser extent ( Fischer, 2006 ). Therefore, most forms of exercise should be expected to increase IL-6 concentrations, and consequently, all downstream cytokines and acute phase proteins. Despite this, increased circulating TNFα concentrations have been reported following resistance exercise resulting in muscle damage ( Townsend et al., 2013 ; Wells et al., 2016 ), as well as following aerobic exercise in high ambient temperatures ( Starkie et al., 2005 ). Thus, disruptions of tissue integrity or excessive increases in core body temperature may be necessary for pro-inflammatory cytokine release, though these are not consistent findings ( Smith et al., 2000 ). To date, five investigations have examined inflammation resulting from acute bouts of HIFT ( Faelli et al., 2020 ; Fogaça et al., 2020 ; Kliszczewicz et al., 2019 ; Tibana et al., 2016 ), repeated bouts of HIFT ( Tibana et al., 2016 , 2019b ) and chronic HIFT ( Faelli et al., 2020 ). Pro-inflammatory cytokines Three prior investigations have examined pro-inflammatory cytokines during and following HIFT sessions, with one examining the TNFα response ( Kliszczewicz et al., 2019 ), and two examining IL-1β ( Faelli et al., 2020 ; Tibana et al., 2019b ). Kliszczewicz et al. (2019) and Tibana et al. (2019b) failed to demonstrate increases in either TNFα or IL-1β following acute bouts of HIFT or a 3 day competition, respectively. While some prior investigations have demonstrated increases in TNFα following exercise ( Townsend et al., 2013 ; Wells et al., 2016 ; Starkie et al., 2005 ), these studies are in highly trained individuals, completing a large volume of exercise that resulted in tissue damage ( Townsend et al., 2013 ; Wells et al., 2016 ) or were completed in high ambient temperatures ( Starkie et al., 2005 ). Given that Kliszczewicz et al. (2019) completed a relatively lower volume of overall exercise, and did not report markers of muscle damage, the failure to demonstrate changes in TNFα concentrations is not surprising ( Petersen & Pedersen, 2005 ). Investigations examining IL-1β in circulation have demonstrated largely inconsistent findings. Prior work has demonstrated significant increases following a marathon ( Ostrowski et al., 1999 ), lower body plyometrics ( Chatzinikolaou et al., 2010 ), a soccer match ( Ispirlidis et al., 2008 ), and 45 min of running ( Vassilakopoulos et al., 2003 ), while others have shown no change in IL-1β concentrations following resistance exercise ( Buford, Cooke & Willoughby, 2009 ), 60 min of running ( Scott et al., 2011 ), or long distance running ( Nielsen et al., 2016 ; Ostrowski et al., 1998 ), whereas others have observed decreases in IL-1β concentrations following skeletal muscle damage ( Smith et al., 2000 ). The inconsistency observed between studies is likely related to the low concentrations observed in circulation, which is commonly undetectable ( Chatzinikolaou et al., 2010 ; Ispirlidis et al., 2008 ; Scott et al., 2011 ), as well as the previously suggested high rate of clearance from circulation ( Ostrowski et al., 1999 ). Therefore, it is unclear whether the lack of change in IL-1β concentrations observed by Tibana et al. (2019b) is expected. Faelli et al. (2020) , however, observed an acute decrease in salivary IL-1β concentrations both prior to and following 8 weeks of HIFT training, with the decrease greater following training compared to prior to training. To our knowledge, only one other investigation examined the salivary IL-1β response to exercise, demonstrating an increase in salivary IL-1β secretion rate following 60 min of recumbent cycling at 75% VO2max ( Usui et al., 2011 ). While these results appear to be opposing, it is important to distinguish between salivary concentrations and secretion rates. Changes in sympathetic activity are known to influence salivary production ( Proctor & Carpenter, 2007 ), and thus can have a concentrating or diluting effect on salivary markers, depending on the level of sympathetic involvement. As such, comparisons that are not corrected for the expected changes in salivary flow rate following exercise ( Chicharro et al., 1998 ) are difficult to interpret and may be more related to changes in salivary production than the marker of interest. Therefore, the decreases reported by Faelli et al. (2020) may have been related to changes in the salivary response to HIFT, rather than the IL-1β response to HIFT. Anti-inflammatory cytokines and acute phase proteins Two investigations have examined the IL-6 response to HIFT. The first, completed by Tibana et al. (2016) in 2016 examined the IL-6 response to two consecutive days of HIFT, and demonstrated the expected rise from pre- to post-exercise, with no differences between consecutive days of training ( Tibana et al., 2016 ; Petersen & Pedersen, 2005 ). Kliszczewicz et al. (2019) examined the differences in IL-6 response to “short” (30 power clean & jerk with 61.4 kg; “Grace”) and “long” (15 min AMRAP; 250 m row, 20 kettlebell swings with 16 kg, 15 dumbbell thrusters with 13.5 kg) HIFT sessions; demonstrating greater IL-6 concentrations following the “short” exercise bout, though no time dependent changes were reported. It is important to note that the significant trial effect may not have been related to the exercise sessions themselves, as the statistical comparison between pre-exercise values also approached significance ( p = 0.057). Notwithstanding, it is surprising that Kliszczewicz et al. (2019) failed to observe time dependent changes in IL-6 concentrations following either HIFT bout given the wide range of exercises that have been previously shown to stimulate IL-6 release, including a single Wingate ( Abedelmalek et al., 2013 ), 5 × 3 min high intensity interval exercise ( Croft et al., 2009 ), resistance exercise ( Nieman et al., 2004 ) and continuous aerobic exercise ( Nieman, Sha & Pappan, 2017 ). Importantly, however, the resting IL-6 concentrations reported by Kliszczewicz et al. (2019) were 4–5 fold higher than those typically reported in other exercise research ( Abedelmalek et al., 2013 ; Croft et al., 2009 ; Nieman et al., 2004 ; Nieman, Sha & Pappan, 2017 ) as well as the concentrations reported by Tibana et al. (2016) . Regardless, the 2–3 fold increase in circulating IL-6 observed by Tibana et al. (2016) is drastically lower than the 5–10 fold increase or greater that is typically associated with prolonged aerobic exercise ( Fischer, 2006 ) and should be considered in this context. Four investigations have examined the acute phase protein CRP ( Fogaça et al., 2020 ; Tibana et al., 2019b ) or the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 ( Kliszczewicz et al., 2019 ; Tibana et al., 2016 , 2019b ) in response to HIFT. Given the delayed response of CRP ( Steensberg et al., 2003 ) and its predominance as a marker of chronic inflammation, it is not surprising that no changes were observed in CRP concentration following a single HIFT session ( Fogaça et al., 2020 ). While it may be more expected to observe an increase in CRP concentrations following multiple days of HIFT competition, as was used by Tibana et al. (2019b) , no changes were observed. Given that IL-6 will stimulate CRP, along with IL-10 ( Steensberg et al., 2003 ), the failure of Tibana et al. (2019b) to observe a rise in IL-10 following 3 days of training, or on the second day of consecutive HIFT sessions ( Tibana et al., 2016 ), it is possible the IL-6 response to HIFT is insufficient to produce an observable increase in either CRP or IL-10. Despite this, IL-10, was demonstrated to increase following a single bout of HIFT ( Tibana et al., 2016 ), though others failed to show this response ( Kliszczewicz et al., 2019 ). Importantly, both Tibana et al. (2016) and Kliszczewicz et al. (2019) assessed both IL-10 and IL-6. When time dependent increases in IL-10 concentrations were observed, time dependent increases in IL-6 concentrations were also observed ( Kliszczewicz et al., 2019 ; Tibana et al., 2016 ). Changes in immune parameters The immune system is a complex integration of various cells, proteins and antibodies functioning together to protect the host from pathogens, as well as to aid in tissue repair following damage ( Parkin & Cohen, 2001 ; Tidball & Villalta, 2010 ). The simplest form of immune measurement is the circulating counts of leukocytes and their subsets: lymphocytes, monocytes and granulocytes. The robust mobilization of leukocytes into circulation following exercise is well documented ( Gleeson, 2007 ; Peake et al., 2017 ; Pedersen & Toft, 2000 ) and is primarily due to a neutrophilia and lymphocytosis ( Robson et al., 1999 ; Nieman et al., 1994 ). The neutrophils and lymphocytes entering circulation as a result of exercise are primarily sourced from the marginal pool in response to increased sheer stress and epinephrine ( Dimitrov, Lange & Born, 2010 ; Foster et al., 1986 ). Subsequently, a reduction of lymphocyte counts from approximately 30 min until up to 72 h after exercise results in a period of time the host may be vulnerable to opportunistic infections; the so-called ‘Open-Window’ ( Nieman et al., 1994 ; Nieman, 1994 ; Simpson et al., 2020 ). Though increased rates of upper respiratory illnesses have previously been demonstrated following singular athletic events ( Nieman et al., 1990 ; Peters, Shaik & Kleinveldt, 2010 ) and training ( Spence et al., 2007 ; Gleeson et al., 2013 ), the post-exercise decline in lymphocyte counts has also been suggested to be programmed egress from circulation, triggered by cortisol ( Okutsu et al., 2005 ; Okutsu et al., 2008 ), that enhances immunosurveillance ( Simpson et al., 2020 ; Campbell & Turner, 2018 ). As such, there is no consensus as to whether exercise induced immunosuppression occurs (for a review, see ( Simpson et al., 2020 )), though immunosuppression is still considered a hallmark of over-reaching and overtraining syndrome ( Meeusen et al., 2013 ). Leukocytes Two prior investigations have examined the leukocyte response to acute HIFT sessions ( Durkalec-Michalski et al., 2021 ; Gomes et al., 2020 ) and demonstrated largely consistent findings with prior literature from other exercise interventions ( Robson et al., 1999 ; Nieman et al., 1994 ; Arroyo et al., 2022 ; Kakanis et al., 2010 ). Briefly, Durkalec-Michalski et al. (2021) examined the reliability of the leukocyte response to an 18 min HIFT session (“Fight Gone Bad”) demonstrating reliable total leukocyte, lymphocyte and granulocyte responses across three training sessions among individuals experienced with HIFT. Moreover, the expected mobilization immediately following the HIFT session was observed for total leukocytes, lymphocytes and monocytes, though, the expected mobilization of granulocytes was not ( p = 0.070) ( Durkalec-Michalski et al., 2021 ). Gomes et al. (2020) demonstrated similar findings following a 20-min HIFT session (“Cindy”) in both individuals that were experienced and novice with HIFT. Briefly, both experienced and novice individuals demonstrated significant increases in total leukocyte and leukocyte subset counts immediately after exercise, though at 30 min post-exercise both groups observed suppressed lymphocyte counts relative to baseline, before returning to baseline levels 24 h later ( Gomes et al., 2020 ). This finding is consistent with almost all other research, which has demonstrated a reduced lymphocyte count between 30 and 120 min post exercise following high intensity interval cycling ( Arroyo et al., 2022 ), continuous aerobic cycling ( Robson et al., 1999 ; Arroyo et al., 2022 ; Kakanis et al., 2010 ) and resistance exercise ( Nieman et al., 1995 ). Therefore, changes in leukocyte populations are similar following HIFT when compared to other forms of exercise, likely due to the observed increase in cortisol concentrations that accompany HIFT ( Gomes et al., 2020 ; Okutsu et al., 2005 ; Okutsu et al., 2008 ; Suzuki et al., 1996 ). Though cortisol stimulates egress of lymphocytes and monocytes from circulation ( Okutsu et al., 2005 ; Okutsu et al., 2008 ), it is also known to indirectly stimulate neutrophil production from the bone marrow, owing to the sustained rise in granulocyte counts following exercise ( Suzuki et al., 1996 ; Davis et al., 1991 ). Interestingly, Gomes et al. (2020) reported a lower granulocyte count in novice when compared to experienced individuals 30 min after exercise, which may be attributable to the greater cortisol response to ‘Cindy’ in the experienced group ( Davis et al., 1991 ). Immunoglobulins Immunoglobulins (Ig), commonly referred to as antibodies, are glycoproteins that are responsible for antigen recognition and are grouped into five primary classes based on their heavy chains; IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG and IgM ( Júnior et al., 2010 ). The most commonly studied Ig is IgA, though it is most associated with saliva in exercise immunology literature due to its role in mucosal immunity ( Bermon et al., 2017 ). Despite this, to date the only paper to have examined IgA following HIFT was collected from circulation ( Tibana et al., 2019b ). As such, interpretations from this data must be put into the proper context of the circulating IgA response, rather than the secretory IgA (SIgA) response. Tibana et al. (2019b) demonstrated a small (~1–2%) increase in circulating IgA at 24 and 72 h following a 3 day HIFT competition, though no change in IgA concentration was present at 48 h post exercise. Given the minimal increases observed ( Tibana et al., 2019b ), and the failure of other exercise interventions to produce changes in circulating IgA concentrations ( Peters, Shaik & Kleinveldt, 2010 ; McKune et al., 2005 ), these results are likely spurious. Importantly, the use of salivary IgA measurements are considered preferable ( Bermon et al., 2017 ), likely due to the sensitivity of SIgA in response to exercise, and the previously reported changes associated with exercise ( Peake et al., 2017 ; Bermon et al., 2017 ; Neville, Gleeson & Folland, 2008 ). Collectively, most markers of inflammation and immune function respond similarly to HIFT as they do to most other types of exercise, however, certain markers require further investigation. Given the possible link between muscle damage and circulating TNFα concentrations ( Townsend et al., 2013 ; Wells et al., 2016 ), future studies should examine the acute TNFα response to HIFT protocols that also result in significant muscle damage. Moreover, studies should focus on this response in untrained vs . highly trained individuals. Additionally, given the link between IL-6, IL-10 and CRP, future investigations examining the acute inflammatory response to HIFT should focus on IL-6; particularly using protocols examining differences between high volumes of aerobic workloads and anaerobic workloads to further elucidate the roles of lactate and glycogen in the overall IL-6 response. Furthermore, utilizing protocols with differing volumes of aerobic and anaerobic workloads should provide a greater distribution of the IL-6 response, which will aid in determining whether HIFT produces a sufficient increase in IL-6 concentrations to augment the IL-10 and CRP responses. Investigations examining chronic HIFT should focus on the response of CRP and SIgA. Given the delayed response of CRP to inflammatory mediators ( Steensberg et al., 2003 ), its overall role in the inflammatory process ( Petersen & Pedersen, 2005 ), and its presence in chronic low-grade inflammation ( Petersen & Pedersen, 2005 ; Lasselin & Capuron, 2014 ), CRP may offer an interesting avenue to monitor the chronic inflammatory response to training. Moreover, given the prevalence of elevated CRP concentrations in various clinical populations ( Lasselin & Capuron, 2014 ), CRP also affords the ability to monitor the capacity of HIFT to reduce inflammation within chronic inflammatory diseases. Lastly, SIgA is considered a primary indicator of mucosal immunity ( Bermon et al., 2017 ), and has previously been linked to increased rates of upper respiratory illnesses as well as training volumes ( Peake et al., 2017 ; Bermon et al., 2017 ; Neville, Gleeson & Folland, 2008 ). As such, future investigations should examine how differing volumes of chronic HIFT may impact SIgA and the athletes’ susceptibility to upper respiratory illnesses. Markers of damage Repeated, strenuous muscle contractions result in ultrastructural damage to the muscle fiber membrane resulting in the leakage of intracellular components ( e.g ., creatine kinase (CK), myoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase) into circulation ( Clarkson & Hubal, 2002 ). In recent years, HIFT has been perceived as an exercise regimen which produces potentially unsafe levels of muscular damage due to the high volume of work performed with moderate intensities. Indeed, several case reports have been published describing patients experiencing high levels of indirect markers of muscle damage and symptoms of rhabdomyolysis following HIFT style training ( Doughty, 2017 ; Hopkins et al., 2019 ; Meyer, Sundaram & Schafhalter-Zoppoth, 2021 ). However, more recent studies and reviews consisting of large-scale surveys demonstrate that HIFT participants experience similar rates of rhabdomyolysis and other injuries as traditional resistance training and other exercise modalities ( Dominski et al., 2019 ; Feito, Burrows & Tabb, 2018 ; Klimek et al., 2018 ). To develop a full picture of HIFT induced muscular damage, additional studies with robust injury epidemiological designs are warranted to provide appropriate metrics ( e.g ., epidemiologic incidence proportion, incidence rate, clinical incidence) of the likelihood of injury while participating in HIFT ( Knowles, Marshall & Guskiewicz, 2006 ). Within this scoping review, six Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) were evaluated which directly studied indirect markers of muscle damage following various HIFT protocols. Fogaça et al. (2020) implemented a HIFT workout consisting partially of heavy snatches (75–80% one-repetition maximum; 1RM) and AMRAP double-unders and power snatches yielded CK elevations immediately (+39%; 440.5 U/L) and 24 h post-exercise (+195.1%; 938.65 U/L) similar to values seen following high-volume resistance exercise ( Gonzalez et al., 2014 ) with no significant elevations in subjective ratings of DOMS. However, most HIFT RCTs enrolling HIFT-trained individuals have reported small but significant increases in markers of muscle damage ( Durkalec-Michalski et al., 2018 ; Durkalec-Michalski et al., 2021 ; Tibana et al., 2022 ), likely indicating that HIFT trained participants adapt to this style of training and experience diminished muscle damage responses over time. In the same vein, one study compared novice (3–8 months CrossFit® experience) to experienced (≥18 months CrossFit® Experience) and found no differences in CK values at any time point following the WOD “Cindy” ( Gomes et al., 2020 ). There is a need in future studies to investigate markers of muscle damage in truly HIFT untrained or naïve individuals to outline the extent of muscle damage and timeline of functional recovery given the concerns raised by previous case studies. In comparison to other exercise modalities, Durkalec-Michalski et al. (2018) compared the muscle damage response between a HIFT workout (“Fight Gone Bad”) and an incremental aerobic cycling test. Although the HIFT workout consisted of resistance exercises and explosive movements ( e.g ., deadlift, push press, box jumps), there were no significant differences between conditions with both workouts producing small elevations of CK (+12.3%) and lactate dehydrogenase (+13.4%) immediately-post exercise likely attributed to uncorrected plasma volume shifts. Additionally, CK values following muscle damaging exercise typically peak 24–48 h post-exercise suggesting this study was not adequately designed to compare muscle damage between groups and highlighting the need for plasma volume corrections in future HIFT investigations examining blood markers. One unique study examined the influence of a 3-day CrossFit® competition consisting of six total workouts on markers of muscle damage in nine men ( Tibana et al., 2019b ). Creatine kinase values peaked at 24 h following the 3-day competition (+48%; 698.7 U/L), with levels returning below baseline values by 72 h after the competition. Interestingly, the authors note that resting CK values were elevated in this cohort (~472 U/L) potentially indicating incomplete recovery from workouts leading up to the competition. Thus, future work examining pre-competition recovery and tapering practices in HIFT athletes may be useful as the unique demands of the sport ( e.g ., resistance, plyometric, anaerobic, & aerobic exercise) poses a challenge to athletes attempting to optimize rest while preserving performance gains. Another important consideration is how HIFT sessions will typically place a HIFT-style “workout-of-the-day” after trainees complete a more traditional-style resistance training workout. Therefore, the true volume and intensity of weight lifted, and subsequent muscle damage, during an entire HIFT session may be much higher in some cases than the single “workout-of-the-day”, which have been studied in RCTs to date. Furthermore, given the diverse metabolic and muscular demand of the wide array of potential designs, future studies comparing the damage response to different HIFT sessions and workouts is also recommended. Markers of oxidative stress Oxidative stress manifests when the accumulation of reactive oxygen species surpasses the organism’s capacity to neutralize these free radicals by its antioxidant defense system ( Urso & Clarkson, 2003 ). The excessive production of these byproducts, often by vigorous anaerobic and aerobic exercise, can promote cellular damage to lipids, proteins, and DNA ( Nikolaidis et al., 2008 ). As described earlier in this review, HIFT provokes a metabolic stress and muscular damage, presumably initiating oxidative imbalances and thereby oxidative stress in its participants. To date, only two studies have investigated indirect markers of oxidative balance pertaining to HIFT programming. Kliszczewicz et al. (2015) examined the oxidative stress response of the workout “Cindy” to a high-intensity treadmill run. This metabolically taxing workout increased lipid peroxides at 1-h (+143%) and 2-h (+256%) post-exercise compared to pre-exercise values with no change in protein carbonyls and no differences observed between the workouts for any stress marker. The authors speculate that the exercise intensity (~90% HRmax) promoted the increase in lipid peroxides as both intense aerobic and anaerobic exercise has been shown to increase lipid damage ( Bloomer et al., 2005 ). Furthermore, an increase in markers of antioxidant defense were seen for total antioxidant capacity and ferric reducing antioxidant power at 1-h and 2-h in both conditions ( Kliszczewicz et al., 2015 ). Faelli et al. (2020) is the only other study observing HIFT induced oxidative stress, measuring salivary uric acid as an indicator of the body’s antioxidant defense. Twenty trained men were allocated to a CrossFit® or resistance training program for 8 weeks with saliva samples collected before and after the first and last workout in each respective program. Results showed significant increases in salivary uric acid following both the CrossFit® and resistance training sessions before and after the 8-week program with no differential responses between groups. However, a lessened percent increase in post-training uric acid levels were observed in the resistance training group, while the CrossFit® group experienced similar percent increases as the first exercise bout. Differences in the final workout programming may account for differences between the antioxidant defense response as the CrossFit® workout was designed as an AMRAP before and after training while the resistance exercise group began with a higher repetition range (15 reps @ 50%1RM) and progressed to a higher intensity (8 reps @ 75%1RM). Thus, due to the nature of HIFT workouts ( e.g . AMRAP, very short rest periods, %HRmax) it is likely these workouts produce a constant challenge to the oxidant balance of the athlete with antioxidant defense markers (Uric Acid, total antioxidant capacity, ferric reducing antioxidant power) elevated to combat free radicals similar to Kliszczewicz et al. (2015) . Clearly, more data is needed to make any meaningful conclusions regarding the magnitude of oxidative stress experienced during HIFT. Future studies should expand the timeframe of measurement as studies investigating eccentric or dynamic muscle damaging exercises commonly see elevations in blood markers of oxidative stress activity later in recovery (24, 48, 72 h) ( Nikolaidis et al., 2008 ). Energy expenditure Weight management through exercise is frequently sought for both aesthetic reasons and to combat complications related to obesity ( Egli et al., 2011 ). For realistic and sustainable weight loss, or to prevent weight gain, the American College of Sports Medicine recommends that workout sessions should require approximately 300–400 kcal to complete for a total of 1,200–2,000 kcal per week ( Donnelly et al., 2009 ). Provided, of course, the individual is also appropriately modifying caloric intake while still meeting nutritional needs ( Seagle et al., 2009 ). Although the design of this strategy is simple, successful implementation is not a guarantee. Individuals often cite a lack of time and motivation as being the greatest challenges to meeting these recommendations ( Hickey & Mason, 2017 ). These specific challenges (time and motivation) also represent some of the attractive aspects about HIFT. Facilities typically schedule classes in 1-h blocks that are divided into periods for warming up, possibly resistance training or gymnastic skill practice, a workout-of-the-day, and a cool-down period. The “workout-of-the-day” is the signature characteristic of HIFT sessions, and these rarely last more than 20 min. Indeed, across all studies examined in this review, these workouts lasted between 4 and 35 min. When compared to moderate-intensity exercise training, the shorter training duration may help alleviate lack of time as a barrier to exercise and promote continuation/adherence. For instance, obese, sedentary adults assigned to a HIFT-based exercise intervention exercised for significantly less time daily (and total time weekly) compared to the moderate-intensity group, and were reportedly more likely to continue their exercise regimen following the investigation ( Heinrich et al., 2014 ). Additionally, high-intensity exercise has previously been reported as having similar and even greater physiological improvements related to energy expenditure (EE) and oxygen consumption compared to other exercise modalities ( Tabata, 2019 ). When comparing a Tabata protocol ( i.e ., 20 s of exhaustive cycling followed by 10 s of rest for 7 to 8 sets) to continuous aerobic training at 70% VO2max, both strategies improved aerobic capacity over 6 weeks of training, but only the Tabata group experienced improved anaerobic capacity ( Tabata et al., 1996 ). Finally, classes are usually held in a group setting. Group exercise may be more effective for sustaining adherence to training because, compared to training alone or with a personal trainer, they involve greater amounts of social recognition, competition, and social support ( Heinrich et al., 2014 ; Hickey & Mason, 2017 ; Kanamori, Takamiya & Inoue, 2015 ). Accordingly, data suggests EE may be greater when completing the same workout in a group setting vs . training alone ( Okonkwo, 2012 ). That said, by definition, the design of each HIFT session varies greatly from day to day, and the number of studies to examine EE during various workout designs and populations is negligible. Their consistency is largely unknown. Therefore, the purpose of this section is to establish a base for future research on describing EE in relation to HIFT. Oxygen consumption Eight studies have reported on the energy demands of HIFT ( Babiash, 2013 ; Brisebois, 2014 ; Brisebois, Biggerstaff & Nichols, 2021 ; Browne et al., 2020 ; Fernández et al., 2015 ; Kliszczewicz, Snarr & Esco, 2014 ; Schubert & Palumbo, 2019 ; Willis et al., 2019 ). Of these, five reported an average EE of approximately 225 kcal following individual HIFT workouts ( Babiash, 2013 ; Browne et al., 2020 ; Fernández et al., 2015 ; Kliszczewicz, Snarr & Esco, 2014 ; Willis et al., 2019 ), whereas three reported an average EE of 502 kcal for an entire hour-long HIFT class session ( Brisebois, 2014 ; Brisebois, Biggerstaff & Nichols, 2021 ; Schubert & Palumbo, 2019 ). As expected, EE during HIFT appears to be heavily influenced by exercise duration ( i.e ., <10 min = ~60–170 kcal, 15 min = ~175–200 kcal, 20 min = ~260–320 kcal, and 35 min = ~465–580, complete HIFT session = ~460–605). Although the EE of an individual workout may help improve understanding the physiological demands and develop potential strategies for improving performance, EE from entire class sessions may be more useful for better understanding the effect of HIFT for weight management. Given the current evidence, it appears HIFT may be a viable and effective means of weight management ( Donnelly et al., 2009 ). However, among studies examining EE and HIFT, several limitations exist in its measurement. EE is frequently analyzed by measuring the oxygen demands of exercise, but this method is limited to that of the aerobic system and does not incorporate anaerobic pathways ( i.e ., phosphagen and glycolytic systems) ( Scott, 2005 ; Matarese, 1997 ). This is problematic for accurately measuring EE when you consider the strategy’s high demand on anaerobic pathways ( Scott, 2005 ), as evidenced by the high lactate concentrations that have been reported (see earlier section). Beyond that, measuring oxygen consumption during many HIFT workouts presents a logistical challenge when using traditional stationary and portable gas analyzers. There are several common examples within this strategy where these devices would interfere with performance ( e.g ., weightlifting exercises that might require the trainee to lift a bar from the ground to overhead, performing gymnastics on a pull-up bar or rings). Attempts have been made to counteract some of these difficulties, as one study utilized data from a graded exercise aerobic capacity test to create a regression equation that estimated oxygen consumption via heart rate ( Babiash, 2013 ). Though this concept alleviates the physical constraints that negatively impact one’s ability to measure oxygen consumption during HIFT, the results were less than ideal. The data was drastically different from direct oxygen consumption via a portable gas analyzer ( e.g ., COSMED K4) and still did not account for anaerobic energy expenditure ( Fernández et al., 2015 ). The regression data indicated that 88.2 kcal were burned during “Fran”, whereas direct oxygen estimated 121 kcal ( Babiash, 2013 ; Fernández et al., 2015 ). With only one of those studies quantifying “Fran” TTC and comparing sex differences ( Babiash, 2013 ), it remains unclear how body mass, lean mass, exercise pacing, and duration affected EE. More importantly, this comparison is only relevant to a single workout and between participants with unclear training histories; only one study reported experience ( Fernández et al., 2015 ). Data quantifying EE in relation to different HIFT workouts, or workout types, is clearly needed before accurate estimation of an entire class is possible. The unlimited potential for designing unique HIFT workouts does present a challenge, but a universal system for equating or classifying workouts ( e.g ., based off duration, complexity, intensity, or pacing) would help in this regard and alleviate the need to assess EE following every single workout in all populations. The lack of a non-invasive, but accurate, method for quantifying aerobic and anaerobic contributions to EE will continue to limit understanding on this topic. However, limiting between-laboratory differences in measurement techniques, descriptions of participant characteristics and training history, and in-study workout performance descriptions would also help. It is possible that better control over the factors known to influence EE would improve the accuracy of estimation equations. Blood glucose As discussed earlier, the maintenance of blood glucose during exercise is augmented by hormonal factors, the autonomic nervous system, as well as enzyme activity at the cellular level ( Brooks et al., 2005 ). Because these and a variety of programming variables ( e.g ., duration, pre- and during-exercise feeding, accumulated fatigue, intensity, etc. ) affect glucose demand, its release into the blood by the kidneys and liver, and its uptake into the muscle, the impact of various exercise protocols is frequently investigated. Seven studies have reported on blood glucose concentrations following an acute bout of HIFT ( Coco et al., 2019 ; Fogaça et al., 2020 ; Kliszczewicz et al., 2017 ; Perciavalle et al., 2016 ; Shaw et al., 2015 ; Tibana et al., 2016 ; Timón et al., 2019 ). Three observed no differences between resting and post-exercise glucose concentrations ( Coco et al., 2019 ; Perciavalle et al., 2016 ; Shaw et al., 2015 ), while the remaining documented an elevated response ( Fogaça et al., 2020 ; Kliszczewicz et al., 2017 ; Tibana et al., 2016 ; Timón et al., 2019 ). Though the limitations discussed in this review about different, un-equated workouts being featured across studies are ever present, the inconsistencies observed in glucose responses may have more to do with sample characteristics. Pre- to post-exercise glucose concentrations were reported as being steady when the study involved a heterogenous sample ( i.e ., variable physical activity and training backgrounds) ( Coco et al., 2019 ; Perciavalle et al., 2016 ; Shaw et al., 2015 ). These ranged from sedentary, novice, adults to professional athletes ( e.g ., CrossFit® athletes in possession of a “certificate of suitability for competitive sports” by a specialist in Sports Medicine, Competitive Bodybuilders). The primary concerns here are the contributions of standardized programming ( e.g ., absolute intensity loads) to relative workout intensity and familiarity with HIFT on workout efficiency. Because regular exercise improves glucose uptake and maintenance, via adaptations in physiological systems, a blunted response is to be expected in trained individuals compared to those who are typically sedentary ( Kristiansen et al., 2000 ). Meanwhile, a more experienced trainee might be assumed to have had more opportunities to familiarize themselves with various movement pattern combinations and develop more effective and efficient pacing strategies. Unfortunately, only one study has investigated glucose responses to HIFT in sedentary, untrained adults ( Shaw et al., 2015 ), and as previously discussed (see prior sections), the reported indicators of HIFT workout intensity ( i.e ., peak blood lactate was 5.95 millimoles per liter; average heart rate was ~53.5% of HRmax) were much less than those reported by other studies. The reduced intensity would have necessarily affected metabolic/glucose demands ( Brooks et al., 2005 ). Likewise, only one pilot study ( Mangine et al., 2021b ) and less than a handful of abstract presentations ( Kliszczewicz et al., 2021 ; Mangine et al., 2021a ; Zeitz et al., 2021 ; Dexheimer et al., 2021 ) have begun investigating aspects about pacing strategy. Thus, the impact of training history and HIFT experience on glucose control remains largely unexplored and leaves much to be assumed when organizing study findings. Nevertheless, changes in blood glucose have been noted in studies that have used more homogenous samples. Fogaça et al. (2020) reported elevated blood glucose concentrations following full HIFT training sessions ( i.e ., warm-up, a strength component, gymnastic component, and metabolic conditioning session) after participants consumed 6 mg/kg body mass of caffeine (+3.2 mmol/L) or placebo (+1.5 mmol/L), with the caffeine condition producing higher concentrations. In an earlier study, Tibana et al. (2016) reported elevated blood glucose following each full training session on two consecutive days. Although both days featured similar programming ( i.e ., the same relative intensity and volume schemes for Olympic lifting, a gymnastic skill-based component, and “workout-of-the-day” duration), the second day’s glucose response was significantly less. This might be explained by different workloads being completed and second day effort, but neither were reported. Likewise, even though participants were asked to avoid caffeine and maintain their normal dietary habits on each day, this was not verified, leaving the reasons behind the second day’s reduced blood glucose response unclear. Elevated blood glucose has also been observed when individual workouts were assessed. Kliszczewicz et al. (2017) reported statistically similar elevations following “Grace” (+45.7%) and a 15-min AMRAP (+65.8%), and these coincided with similar lactate, heart rate, and insulin responses. Further, blood glucose returned to baseline at 1-h post-exercise while insulin concentrations were lower than baseline assessments. Participants completed both workouts fasted (4 h), 1 week apart at the same time of day. In a later study, Timón et al. (2019) also had participants complete two different HIFT workouts 72 h apart from each other, and reported elevated glucose concentrations. However, it is unclear when concentrations returned to baseline, as the next time point did not occur until 24-h post-exercise. Interestingly, glucose elevations on the second workout (+71.5%) exceeded those of the first (37.4%). The reasons for why this latter study observed statistical differences in glucose responses are currently unclear but can likely be attributed to several methodological differences existing between studies. For this specific measure, both studies carried a similar sample size (10 vs . 12 participants) but different definitions for being considered HIFT-trained (3 vs . 12 months), different durations between experimental visits (3 vs . 7 days), different fasted durations (4 vs . 8 h), and utilized different HIFT workouts. Any of these may have been responsible for the lack of consistency between these studies. While the exact details about each workout’s programming, aside from “Grace” (30 clean and jerks at 64.1 kg), may be found in Table 2 , two notable differences were that Timón et al. (2019) programmed relative loads for power cleans in the second workout (40% 1RM equaling ~37.3 kg) and the difference in resultant pacing (workout 1 = 0.30 repetitions per second; workout 2 = 0.07 repetitions per second) was much greater than what occurred in the study by Kliszczewicz et al. (2017) (“Grace” = 0.15 repetitions per second; 15-min AMRAP = 0.30 repetitions per second). Though relative intensity of loads used during “Grace” and the 15-min AMRAP remain unknown, the combination of wall ball shots with relative power clean loads led to a much slower pace and likely a greater metabolic demand. It is advisable for future studies to consider relative intensity when explaining and discussing the context of physiological findings in relation to HIFT. Acute power output outcomes An individual’s expression of power may represent a desired training outcome, or it could be used as a metric of readiness ( i.e ., how they are responding to and recovering from training). Unless it is stated otherwise ( e.g ., “for quality”), HIFT workouts consistently direct trainees to give maximal effort ( i.e ., AMRAP, TTC), which of course, is still auto-regulated. This directive is advantageous because it allows performance to be quantified by the individual’s score in a workout. It also allows progress to be monitored via performance changes in standardized workouts ( e.g ., “Cindy”, “Fran”, etc. ) ( Feito et al., 2018b ; CrossFit, 2002 ). For example, progress is easily tracked by the changes in the number of repetitions completed during a standardized AMRAP ( e.g ., “Cindy”) or the TTC for standard workload ( e.g ., “Fran”). Improving one’s score in either of these workout types also means that more work was completed in the same amount of time ( i.e ., that the expression of power improved). However, it would be inconsistent with HIFT’s definition to regularly assign the same benchmark workouts ( Feito et al., 2018b ; CrossFit, 2019 ). Instead, indirect measures ( e.g ., vertical jump (VJ)) may be more consistently used to estimate an individual’s response to training and monitor fatigue. That is, once expected changes in power following HIFT workouts and or competition are better understood. Of the 47 articles reviewed, changes in acute power expression were an outcome measure in only five studies ( Escobar, Morales & Vandusseldorp, 2017 ; Tibana et al., 2016 , 2019b ; Mate-Munoz et al., 2017 , 2018 ). One of the earliest studies to contribute evidence related to recovery was primarily designed to examine the consistency of metabolic parameters measured during the hero workout “Rahoi” ( Escobar, Morales & Vandusseldorp, 2017 ). Though examining recovery was not a specific study aim, short-term recovery was revealed as a consequence of the investigation’s use of a familiarization session for a standardized HIFT workout and lack of intervention between trials. Briefly, participants completed a 12-min AMRAP, rested completely for 3 days, and then repeated the workout (140.2 ± 25.9 repetitions); beating their initial score (131.2 ± 27.2 repetitions). The improved repetition count suggests that 3 days of rest provided sufficient recovery and enabled a greater expression of power ( i.e ., more work completed in 12 min) when the workout was repeated. That said, an alternate conclusion that still implies sufficient recovery states that the first trial familiarized the participants and allowed them to formulate a more appropriate strategy for the second trial. It is not clear whether the participants had ever completed “Rahoi” prior to the study, but the authors did ensure that participants had sufficient experience with HIFT (>1 year) and the specific exercises. Nevertheless, it would seem unlikely for performance to improve on the second trial, even with a better strategy, without sufficient recovery. In fact, it is plausible that 3 days was more than sufficient to allow for complete recovery. The participants reported training on at least three sessions per week, which would equate to less time between their typical training session days. The design of this study might actually represent a reduction in the training stimulus, due to participants having more time to recover, and limit the practical application of these particular findings. In a pair of studies, Mate-Munoz et al. (2017 , 2018) examined changes in VJ height and kinetics following three types of HIFT workouts in nearly identical samples of collegiate-aged men with no HIFT experience. All testing sessions for both studies followed the same order (“Cindy” → Double-Under “Tabata”-style → 1-RM Power Clean testing → Power Clean AMRAP) where sessions were separated by 1 week and participants refrained from physical activity for 48-h prior to each session. Consequently, both studies suffered from the same limitation that earlier testing sessions and a lack of control with physical activity (before 48-h pre-exercise) could have influenced performance on subsequent testing sessions. Still, each session’s effect on power was predominantly the same. Both reported reduced VJ performance quantified by height (−6.5% to −6.8%), relative average power (−4.2% to −4.4%), total average power (−3.9% to −4.0%), and take-off velocity (−2.7% to −12.2%) within 3 min of completing “Cindy”. Likewise, the same VJ measures declined in both studies by 3.1–7.6% after a 5-min AMRAP of power cleans using a load equal to ~40% 1-RM. However, only the first study ( Mate-Munoz et al., 2017 ) observed reductions VJ performance (−1.2% to 3.6%) after a “Tabata”-style ( i.e ., 8, 20-s intervals with 10 s of rest) workout with double rope skips (a.k.a., double-unders), whereas only a greater reduction in take-off velocity was noted in the second study ( Maté-Muñoz et al., 2018 ). While this exception may be simply attributed to the variability in training status that would be present among different samples of novice trainees, more research is clearly needed for confirmation. Though helpful for providing starting points, the previously mentioned studies within this section do not address the effect of workouts occurring on consecutive days. This is a distinct possibility since CrossFit®, as an organization, publishes workouts daily on their website ( CrossFit, 2001 ), and many affiliates are open 6–7 days per week, may incorporate these published workouts or write their own, and are not likely to actively limit members from attending daily. Currently, only two investigations out of Brazil have looked at the effect of consecutive workouts on power expression ( Tibana et al., 2016 , 2019b ). The first study ( Tibana et al., 2016 ) examined changes in VJ power (peak and average) across two consecutive workout days that each prescribed a strength, gymnastic, and metabolic conditioning component but failed to adequately describe the extent of the participants’ HIFT experience. All that was known was that participants possessed at least 6 months of HIFT experience and an unknown amount of resistance training experience prior to enrollment. The importance of their status is relevant to their ability to recover from training. The results showed that each workout elicited a significant reduction in average VJ power, but these returned to pre-exercise values within 24-h ( i.e ., suggesting sufficient recovery). However, peak VJ power steadily improved after each workout and between workouts so that by 24-h post the second training session, peak VJ power was significantly greater than what was observed prior to the first training session. This could imply a potentiating effect across workout sessions, but since peak power is representative of the power expressed during a single instant, it might simply be a spurious observation for a highly variable metric. In a later study from the same laboratory ( Tibana et al., 2019b ), VJ height was estimated (from flight time) in a more experienced sample ( i.e ., 28.9 months of HIFT experience) before and after they competed in a 3-day, three-person team HIFT competition. While the first study showed recovered or improved VJ power within 24 h ( Tibana et al., 2016 ), VJ height did not recover until 48-h post-competition in the later study. It is possible that the more demanding nature of the competition or the additional day of training contributed the participants’ need for additional rest. However, the lack of sensitivity of VJ height compared to VJ kinetics may have also contributed to this difference ( Mathieu et al., 2017 ). Regardless, both studies demonstrate that individuals with at least 6-months of HIFT experience may recover from 2–3 consecutive days of training within 24–48 h. Still, the infinite possibilities for HIFT programming limits the generalizability of these findings. A considerable amount of research surrounding a greater variety of HIFT workouts is needed before the recovery from such workouts can be understood well enough to begin forming recommendations. Conclusions High-intensity functional training is a strategy that variably incorporates functional movements from weightlifting, gymnastics, and traditional cardiorespiratory exercise into daily workouts, which are intended to be performed at high-intensity, to improve general physical preparedness ( Feito et al., 2018b ). The intentional ambiguity and breadth of this definition leaves open an almost infinite number of possibilities for its interpretation in practice. Indeed, the composition and structure of each workout may be different on every day within the same week, month, year, or ever. Regardless of composition and structure, workouts are often accompanied by instructions meant to encourage effort put forth by trainees ( e.g ., repetitions completed within a set amount of time, time taken to complete prescribed tasks, frequency of rest breaks, etc. ), but this is ultimately self-regulated by the individual, and thus, may lead to a wide range of acute physiological responses. Although exponential increases in popularity and research have been observed over the last two decades ( i.e ., since HIFT’s formal inception) ( Thompson, 2021 ; Feito, Brown & Olmos, 2019 ), collective information on any given topic is still relatively limited compared to more traditional exercise strategies and sports. There is an extreme lack of consistency in the populations, variables measured, and workouts examined across studies examining acute responses to HIFT. Consequently, developing any kind of generalized conclusions via meta-analysis or systematic review on any given HIFT-related physiological response would be premature at this time. Instead, synthesizing the available information into a scoping review to report the current collection of findings and highlight areas in need of attention is more appropriate. This scoping review observed clear discrepancies in the frequency of specific variables reported across existing studies. For instance, the number of studies reporting indicators of intensity ( i.e ., lactate and heart rate) is overwhelmingly higher than any other outcome variable. Although there may be several valid explanations for this ( e.g ., simplicity, availability of equipment, cost), the fact remains that acute responses to HIFT cannot be well understood without more studies taking a holistic approach. Severe deficiencies were noted in the quantity of research investigating various biochemical responses ( e.g ., individual hormone responses, inflammatory and damage markers) and energy demands. Regarding energy demands, greater attention should be placed on determining the best options for overcoming the several physical limitations related to its measurement. Current methodologies limit the types of exercises that may be incorporated into workouts under investigation, which is stark contrast to the spirit of the training strategy. This problem must be solved before HIFT-related energy demands can be adequately and comprehensively covered. Perhaps the only generalized conclusion that can be made about HIFT at this time is that it lives up to its name. All but two investigations that reported indicators of intensity found a variety of HIFT workouts elicited a lactate or heart rate response that could be classified as vigorous. At best, though, these metrics provide a summary of the overall workout’s intensity. They do not quantify the contribution of individual workout components, and this is important for workouts that include weightlifting and gymnastic components. Since absolute loads are often prescribed in HIFT, knowing the relative intensity of those loads is essential for understanding acute physiological responses. Likewise, the trainee’s individual ability and efficiency in performing various gymnastic movements can drastically impact their allowable workout pace, and thus their physiological response. Currently, no universal method exists for quantifying the relative contribution of each component to intensity and work completed exists. Without such a metric, fair comparisons between different HIFT workouts or studies will be highly subjective. Another important observation noted in this review is the variability in sample characteristics reported across studies. This may be partially addressed by improving descriptions of the relative intensity of studied HIFT workouts. More importantly, however, more consistency is needed in reporting training history and how training status is defined. Trained or experienced participants have been described as having 3 months to several years of HIFT experience. There are individual qualities, beyond one’s physiology, which are difficult to learn after only a few months of training ( e.g ., gymnastics skill, weightlifting technique, familiarity with various workout structures) but will still impact the trainee’s approach to a workout, as well as their physiological response. Before universal agreement on experience classifications is possible, future studies must become more consistent with the degree of detail reported about participants. From these, systematic reviews and meta-analyses may be performed to identify classification thresholds. Additional Information and Declarations Competing Interests Gerald T.

At least 30 minutes a day of moderate intensity aerobic exercise per day is recommended for weight loss and maintenance but greater amounts appear to increase the magnitude of weight loss and maintenance. Resistance training has recently been shown to have positive effects on body composition but does not typically show significant decreases in weight. Regardless of weight loss, both aerobic exercise and resistance training have been shown to diminish risk factors for cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Since exercise is only effective if sustained, behavioural strategies such as self-monitoring, goal setting, social support , etc. are used to help individuals start and maintain exercise programs and show improved results compared to exercise programs without behavioural strategies. The available evidence indicates that exercise is an important component of weight loss and perhaps the best predictor of weight maintenance. Section snippets Energy balance Obesity is the result of excess energy intake compared to energy expenditure. In order to lose weight, a negative energy balance must be evoked and to maintain lost weight, energy balance must be maintained. To illustrate, Figure 1 shows the two sides of energy balance classically depicted by a balance scale. When energy intake exceeds energy expenditure weight gain occurs and when energy expenditure exceeds energy intake weight loss occurs. If energy intake and energy expenditure are matched Exercise for weight loss and maintenance There are limited choices an individual can make in the attempt to evoke a negative energy balance for weight loss or to attain energy balance for weight maintenance. Certainly, the most common method for weight loss and maintenance is diet; however, just as certainly, diet does not provide a long-term solution. Over 50% of individuals who lose weight through diet eventually regain the weight they lost. 4 Dietary restraint is difficult across time; it represents a state of deprivation, and runs By what mechanisms can exercise alter energy balance? Exercise may alter energy balance through a variety of mechanisms including the energy expended during the exercise activity, the energy expended shortly after the activity, and the alteration of resting metabolism. The most obvious mechanism for exercise to alter energy balance is through the energy expended during the exercise activity. Energy expenditure during exercise with endurance athletes may reach levels 15 times greater than resting. 8 Previously sedentary but otherwise healthy older Recommend guidelines for exercise during weight loss and weigh maintenance The current guidelines regarding exercise and physical activity can be very confusing to the general public. In 1995, the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) recommended that sedentary adults accumulate ""30 minutes or more of moderate-intensity physical activity on most, preferably all days of the week"". 22 In 1996, similar recommendations were made by the US Surgeon General 23 and the National Institutes of Health. 23 These are the recommendations that are most familiar to Americans, but Quantification of energy expenditure Many weight loss and weight maintenance programs incorporate regular exercise as a means to facilitate weight loss or maintain weight loss. When incorporating exercise into these programs it is important to monitor the volume of exercise (i.e. energy expenditure), so that modifications can be made when necessary due to physiological changes, weight loss, etc. However, exercise is a behaviour and energy expenditure is a result of this behaviour. Therefore, methods for measuring exercise and Resistance training and 24‐hour energy expenditure The EE associated with resistance training is lower than that typically shown with endurance exercise; however, resistance training may increase energy expenditure by promoting an increase in muscle mass. Muscle mass has a resting energy requirement of ∼15–25 kcal per kilogram per day 44 and would utilize energy not just during exercise, but also throughout the day. Thus, although the energy expenditure of resistance training is relatively low, the accumulated energy expenditure across 24-hours Health benefits of exercise without weight loss Exercise, including aerobic and resistance training, is widely held as having a beneficial impact on health regardless of changes in weight and body composition. There are many studies demonstrating the positive influence of exercise and fitness on cardiovascular disease.68., 69. This positive impact on cardiovascular disease seen with aerobic training is further supported by numerous studies indicating a reduction in many of the major risk factors, including blood pressure, cholesterol, and Behavioural strategies for initiation and maintenance of Physical activity We know that many individuals will not or cannot initiate weight loss programs and even less are able to maintain weight that has been lost. According to the US Surgeon Generals Report on Physical Activity 94 , ‘Behavioral strategies to promote diet and PA should be used routinely as they are helpful in achieving weight loss and weight maintenance’ (p. 82). The primary reason behavioural strategies are encouraged is that behaviours are learned and can, in turn, be changed or modified. Behavioural Conclusions Exercise is an important component of energy balance and is the only component under voluntary control. It therefore provides an avenue for intervention in the attempt to manage weight. However, exercise has generally not been associated with large amounts of weight loss due to the relatively small energy expenditure achieved by exercise. Conversely, exercise is perhaps the best predictor of weight maintenance since it is capable of generating enough energy expenditure to compensate for small Special issue articles Recommended articles References (99) J.E.

The literature suggests that offering some degree of human support to website users may boost usage and outcomes. Objective: We disseminated the POWeR (“Positive Online Weight Reduction”) Web-based weight management intervention in a community setting. POWeR consisted of weekly online sessions that emphasized self-monitoring, goal-setting, and cognitive/behavioral strategies. Our primary outcome was intervention usage and we investigated whether this was enhanced by the addition of brief telephone coaching. We also explored group differences in short-term self-reported weight loss. Methods: Participants were recruited using a range of methods including targeted mailouts, advertisements in the local press, notices on organizational websites, and social media. A total of 786 adults were randomized at an individual level through an online procedure to (1) POWeR only (n=264), (2) POWeR plus coaching (n=247), or (3) a waiting list control group (n=275). Those in the POWeR plus coaching arm were contacted at approximately 7 and 28 days after randomization for short coaching telephone calls aimed at promoting continued usage of the website. Website usage was tracked automatically. Weight was assessed by online self-report. Results: Of the 511 participants allocated to the two intervention groups, the median number of POWeR sessions completed was just one (IQR 0-2 for POWeR only, IQR 0-3 for POWeR plus coach). Nonetheless, a substantial minority completed at least the core three sessions of POWeR: 47 participants (17.8%, 47/264) in the POWeR-only arm and 64 participants (25.9%, 64/247) in the POWeR plus coaching arm. Participants in the POWeR plus coaching group persisted with the intervention for longer and were 1.61 times more likely to complete the core three sessions than the POWeR-only group (χ 2 1 =4.93; OR 1.61, 95% CI 1.06-2.47; n=511). An intention-to-treat analysis showed between-group differences in weight loss ( F 2,782 =12.421, P <.001). Both intervention groups reported more weight loss than the waiting list control group. Weight loss was slightly, but not significantly, greater in the POWeR plus coaching group. A large proportion of participants assigned to POWeR plus coaching refused phone calls or were not contactable (57.9%, 143/247). Exploratory analyses identified health and sociodemographic differences between those who did and did not engage in coaching when it was made available to them. Users who engaged with coaching used the intervention more and lost more weight than those who did not. Conclusions: In common with most Web-based intervention studies, usage of POWeR was suboptimal overall. However, our findings suggest that supplementing Web-based weight management with brief human support could improve usage and outcomes in those who take it up.

Interventions that promote changes in diet and physical activity and include behavior modification techniques such as goal setting and self-monitoring are considered the gold standard of treatment [ Shaw K, O'Rourke P, Del Mar C, Kenardy J. Psychological interventions for overweight or obesity. Cochrane Database Syst Rev  2005;2(2):3818. [ CrossRef ] 2 ]. However, high cost and low access limit the reach of such programs when delivered face-to-face by health professionals [ Wadden TA, Butryn ML, Wilson C.

Despite holding promise as potentially cost-effective interventions, recent reviews of Web-based weight loss interventions have found that effect sizes for weight loss tend to be fairly modest, with substantial heterogeneity in outcomes, and many online programs suffer from suboptimal engagement [ Neve M, Morgan PJ, Jones PR, Collins CE.

Such findings are not limited to Web-based weight loss interventions but are common across different types of eHealth interventions. One possible explanation for variations in the efficacy of and engagement with Web-based interventions is the variation in the human contact participants have to support them as they participate in the Web-based program. Human support may be in various formats including face-to-face individual or group meetings, telephone calls, text messages, emails, or online chat. It may be from health professionals, researchers, or technicians and may serve various purposes ranging from answering technical queries, to encouraging prolonged use, to providing substantial therapeutic input. Taken as a whole, the eHealth literature suggests that engagement and behavioral or health outcomes for Web-based interventions tend to be better when usage is accompanied by some form of human contact [ Mohr DC, Cuijpers P, Lehman K.

Interestingly though, the few randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of weight management programs that have directly compared different types or intensities of human support have not always found evidence that higher support versions have superior engagement or weight-related outcomes [ Glasgow RE, Kurz D, King D, Dickman JM, Faber AJ, Halterman E,  et al.

Internet delivered behavioral obesity treatment. Prev Med  2010 Aug;51(2):123-128  [ FREE Full text ] [ CrossRef ] [ Medline ] 6 ]. Yet, in these trials, even participants in the ostensible minimally-supported website arms actually received considerable human contact and support, including initial orientation to the website and contact with the research team throughout the trial [ Glasgow RE, Kurz D, King D, Dickman JM, Faber AJ, Halterman E,  et al.

Internet delivered behavioral obesity treatment. Prev Med  2010 Aug;51(2):123-128  [ FREE Full text ] [ CrossRef ] [ Medline ] 6 ]. Therefore, these trials cannot provide clear comparisons between Web-based interventions provided with and without human support. Furthermore, recent reviews have drawn attention to how the mixture of modalities and features in Web-based interventions complicates the task of teasing out the impact of any specific component within and across research studies [ Lustria ML, Noar SM, Cortese J, Van Stee SK, Glueckauf RL, Lee J. A meta-analysis of Web-delivered tailored health behavior change interventions. J Health Commun  2013;18(9):1039-1069. [ CrossRef ] [ Medline ] 22 ]. Overall, there has been insufficient research focused on how to use human contact to boost engagement with Web interventions. This is an important research topic since extensive reach and low marginal cost per additional user are among the key proposed benefits of Web-based interventions [ Kohl LF, Crutzen R, de Vries NK. Online prevention aimed at lifestyle behaviors: a systematic review of reviews. J Med Internet Res  2013;15(7):e146  [ FREE Full text ] [ CrossRef ] [ Medline ] 13 ]. Despite this, many Web-based weight management interventions evaluated to date have featured face-to-face orientation sessions plus various forms of telephone, email, Web chat, or face-to-face contact with a health care professional or researcher during the intervention period [ Glasgow RE, Kurz D, King D, Dickman JM, Faber AJ, Halterman E,  et al. Outcomes of minimal and moderate support versions of an internet-based diabetes self-management support program. J Gen Intern Med  2010 Dec;25(12):1315-1322  [ FREE Full text ] [ CrossRef ] [ Medline ] 4 - Patrick K, Calfas KJ, Norman GJ, Rosenberg D, Zabinski MF, Sallis JF,  et al. Outcomes of a 12-month Web-based intervention for overweight and obese men. Ann Behav Med  2011 Dec;42(3):391-401. [ CrossRef ] [ Medline ] 8 ]. By adding human support, the cost and reach benefits may be undermined because costs increase when staff are required, particularly if support is provided by highly trained professionals. Gaining a better understanding of what types of human contact boost engagement with Web interventions, and investigating brief and low-cost formats for such support, is therefore of great importance. It is equally important to understand how human contact/support might influence engagement with and effectiveness of Web interventions. A clear framework for this has been absent until recent theoretical work on “Supportive Accountability”’ [ Mohr DC, Cuijpers P, Lehman K. Supportive accountability: a model for providing human support to enhance adherence to eHealth interventions. J Med Internet Res  2011;13(1):e30  [ FREE Full text ] [ CrossRef ] [ Medline ] 14 ], which proposes that human support can enhance adherence to eHealth interventions through accountability to another person. Accountability is the expectation that an individual may be called upon to explain his or her actions to another person. The model hypothesizes that successfully fostering “Supportive Accountability” involves some human presence, either face-to-face, or remotely. The model considers progress monitoring to be central to fostering accountability and proposes ways in which to conduct this in an effective and acceptable way. A recent trial using telephone coaching based upon this model showed that this form of human support increased adherence to a Web-based depression intervention [ Mohr DC, Duffecy J, Ho J, Kwasny M, Cai X, Burns MN,  et al. A randomized controlled trial evaluating a manualized TeleCoaching protocol for improving adherence to a Web-based intervention for the treatment of depression. PLoS One  2013;8(8):e70086  [ FREE Full text ] [ CrossRef ] [ Medline ] 23 ]. Current Study Context and Aims In the current study, we disseminated “POWeR” (Positive Online Weight Reduction), a completely automated Web-based weight management intervention (described in detail below). Other RCTs (ISRCTN31685626 and ISRCTN21244703) are examining the efficacy of POWeR for weight loss in a primary care setting with nurse support. In contrast, the current study sought to investigate engagement with this intervention in a high-reach, low-cost public health context. Unlike previous Web-based weight management trials, our research procedures were handled automatically by our intervention software, which meant that the trial took place without participants having contact with the researchers at registration, baseline, and follow-up. We examined engagement with the intervention and self-reported weight change in this more remote context and tested whether the provision of brief human support influenced this. Our primary aim was to assess whether human support in the form of brief telephone coaching, based around the Supportive Accountability framework [ Mohr DC, Cuijpers P, Lehman K. Supportive accountability: a model for providing human support to enhance adherence to eHealth interventions. J Med Internet Res  2011;13(1):e30  [ FREE Full text ] [ CrossRef ] [ Medline ] 14 ], improved engagement with our Web-based weight intervention, as measured by session usage. Secondary analyses examined the self-reported weight loss that participants experienced when following the coached and uncoached version of the intervention. We also explored the uptake of telephone coaching, whether this was associated with user characteristics and outcomes, and whether accountability to a coach might be a mechanism through which coaching boosts engagement with the website and weight loss. Methods Recruitment Ethics and research governance approvals were granted by the University of Southampton and the trial was registered (ISRCTN98176068). A variety of methods were used to recruit participants from community settings in the North East of the United Kingdom between June 2012 and January 2013. We mailed out written invitations to 15,000 homes, which resulted in 287 registrations—a 1.91% response rate. Other recruitment methods included local press releases, posters in community settings, and information on local government and NHS (National Health Service) public health websites and intranet, as well as paid advertising on Facebook and posts/tweets on organizational social media. Recruitment materials invited members of the public to try a new online weight management program as part of a research trial. Recruitment materials and participant information sheets carried the organization name and logo of the local NHS public health organization and also emphasized the involvement of academics and clinicians from the University of Southampton in the development of the intervention. Participation was free and no financial incentives were provided. Eligibility, Screening, Consent, and Registration All recruitment procedures including study information, eligibility screening, obtaining informed consent, baseline data collection, and randomization were conducted online using automated procedures. To proceed through the registration process, participants had to report being UK-resident adults with a body mass index (BMI) of ≥23 and having regular Internet access. Users were cautioned to consult a health professional prior to using POWeR if they reported having a condition that might make changing diet and exercise inappropriate. The first author’s email address was provided for asking questions prior to signing up (no questions were received). A “POWeR” email address was provided once participants were in the trial. Brief email contact between participants and the first author took place if participants needed to report technical problems or request withdrawal or cancellation of automatic email prompts or reminders. With the exception of coach phone calls and emails received by the POWeR plus coaching participants, there was no other human contact with participants while they were in the trial. Randomization and Blinding Randomization was at the individual level and stratified by BMI (lower BMI <27.5 vs higher BMI ≥27.5) to ensure that the arms were reasonably balanced in terms of overweight, obese, and morbidly obese participants. Participants were allocated with a balanced ratio to one of three arms. The “POWeR only” arm was granted immediate access to the POWeR intervention. The “POWeR plus coaching” arm was granted immediate access to the intervention plus telephone coaching (described below). The waiting list “Control” arm was blocked from using POWeR for 8 weeks. They were not given specific instructions to abstain from weight management or avoid using other interventions during this time. At the end of the 8 weeks, they were provided with access to POWeR (without coaching). It was impossible to blind participants or coaches to trial arm assignment. Researchers were not blinded but did not interact with or collect data from participants directly, as usage was tracked automatically and self-report data was collected via online questionnaires. Sample Size The sample size was calculated a priori using GPOWER v3.1 [ Faul F, Erdfelder E, Lang AG, Buchner A. G*Power 3: a flexible statistical power analysis program for the social, behavioral, and biomedical sciences. Behav Res Methods  2007 May;39(2):175-191. [ Medline ] 24 ]. We powered the study to compare the POWeR only and the POWeR plus coaching arm on our primary outcome variable (intervention usage). We calculated that we would need 253 participants in each arm to detect a small effect size ( d =.25) with .80 power (alpha=.05, 2-tailed test). Therefore, we aimed to randomize a total of 759 participants (2 intervention arms and 1 control arm). Because our primary outcome was automatically logged by our website software for all participants, we did not deliberately over-recruit in order to allow for losing participants to follow-up. The Web-Based Intervention POWeR is a fully automated, tailored, Web-based weight management intervention constructed using the LifeGuide open access intervention authoring software [ LifeGuide Software.: University of Southampton \n                        \xa0 URL: https://www.lifeguideonline.org/ [accessed 2014-03-24]\n                         [ WebCite Cache ] 25 ]. The intervention aims to empower users to become their own personal health trainer through the development of new self-regulation skills. POWeR draws on various theoretical models and incorporates multiple behavior change techniques. The intervention planning and considerable iterative qualitative work undertaken during development stages are described in detail elsewhere [ Yardley L, Williams S, Bradbury K, Garip G, Renouf S, Ware L,  et al. Integrating user perspectives into the development of a Web-based weight management intervention. Clinical Obesity  2012;2(5-6):132-141. [ CrossRef ] 26 ]. POWeR is structured as a series of online sessions. In the first session, users choose an eating plan, explore their personal motivations for weight loss, and set personalized eating goals to follow in the subsequent week. Further sessions all begin with a weight and goal review (ie, self-monitoring and goal-setting with tailored feedback) and then progress to new content that includes information and tools to help develop cognitive and behavioral self-regulatory weight management skills, each with an explicit scientific rationale. There are interactive activities for participants to complete, user stories/testimonials, and optional links to more detailed information, including reputable external websites. The second session theme is social support and the third focuses on physical activity. The first three sessions are “core” sessions that each user is funneled through; then from the fourth session onward, after initially working through the weight and goal review, users have a choice of whether to also access Web pages about specific topics that interest them (eg, emotional eating, fitting healthy behavior into busy lives) or whether to end the session at that point. A demonstration version of POWeR can be accessed at [ POWeR Demonstration.  \n                        \xa0 URL: https://www.lifeguideonline org/player/play/powernedemo [accessed 2014-03-24]\n                         [ WebCite Cache ] 27 ]. See Multimedia Appendix 1 Screenshots from POWeR. PDF File (Adobe PDF File), 229KB Multimedia Appendix 1 for screenshots. Intended use of POWeR is the completion of one session per week. Each time a session is completed the subsequent session becomes available 7 days later and remains available until the user next logs in. Participants received automatic email reminders to advise them that their new session is ready, provide a description of what will be covered, and invite them to log in to use it. They also received one automatic email reminder one week later if they had not logged on. A total of 12 different sessions are available and users can continue to complete sessions for as long as they are finding it useful and log in to complete weekly weight and goal reviews even after all sessions have been completed. In the current trial, we followed up with participants and examined their engagement with the intervention and weight loss 8 weeks after randomization. During the trial, the intervention content was “frozen” and no changes or bug fixes were made to the POWeR website. Coaching The coaching calls aimed to promote continued usage of the POWeR website and adherence to the recommendations within the website. Coaches were postgraduate students and research assistants affiliated with the health psychology research center at the University of Southampton who had been provided with training in the coaching procedures and a brief introduction to the POWeR website. Coaching procedures were developed based on the Supportive Accountability model [ Mohr DC, Cuijpers P, Lehman K. Supportive accountability: a model for providing human support to enhance adherence to eHealth interventions. J Med Internet Res  2011;13(1):e30  [ FREE Full text ] [ CrossRef ] [ Medline ] 14 ]. Coaches could access a coaching portal of POWeR where they were able to review the usage patterns of participants, a graph showing weight change, and the participant’s current eating and physical activity goals and plans. Coaching sessions were focused on promoting on-going use of the Web intervention by monitoring usage and giving feedback on progress, and offering support and encouragement for use of the website. The calls were scheduled for one week and four weeks after participants were granted access to POWeR. Each coaching call was intended to last for approximately 10 minutes. Coaches followed detailed protocols that set out ways to proceed with the two phone calls depending on whether the user was engaging with POWeR as intended (summarized in Table 1 ). Multimedia Appendix 2 Coaching protocol. PDF File (Adobe PDF File), 39KB Multimedia Appendix 2 contains detailed coaching protocols, plus further details on scheduling of coaching sessions, attempts made to contact participants, and the coaches’ background, training, and supervision.

The LifeGuide software logs all usage data including which pages were viewed, in what order, when, and for how long. For the current analyses, we analyzed the number of POWeR sessions each participant had completed by 8-week follow-up. All self-report data were collected using Web-based questionnaires. To ensure we had complete data on our participants at baseline, all baseline questionnaires were mandatory (ie, the participant could not progress without submitting a response). The follow-up point was 8 weeks post-randomization. Automatically generated emails requested participants to complete a brief follow-up questionnaire and included a hyperlink to Web-based questionnaires. Up to three reminder emails were automatically issued after 5, 10, and 15 days of non-response. At baseline, we collected demographic data including: age, gender, marital status, ethnicity, highest education level, employment status, postcode (from which we derived an Index of Multiple Deprivation [IMD]), health literacy (a single-item measure) [ Morris NS, MacLean CD, Chew LD, Littenberg B. The Single Item Literacy Screener: evaluation of a brief instrument to identify limited reading ability. BMC Fam Pract  2006;7:21  [ FREE Full text ] [ CrossRef ] [ Medline ] 28 ], and estimated weekly hours of Internet usage. Participants self-reported height (in cm or feet/inches) and weight (as measured on home scales). Participants also reported whether a health professional had ever advised weight loss or referred them to weight management programs, and whether they had asthma, diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, or a stroke. At follow-up, participants in all treatment arms were asked to enter their current weight and whether they had followed any other weight loss programs over the last 8 weeks. Participants in both of the active treatment arms were also administered the Supportive Accountability Questionnaire [ Duffecy JKM, Cai X, Mohr D. Supportive accountability: measurement of a framework for adherence to behavioral intervention technologies.  2013 Presented at: International Society for Research on Internet Interventions (ISRII) 6th Scientific Meeting; May 2013; Chicago, USA. 29 ], which assesses the user’s perceptions that they are held accountable to somebody else for their adherence to the intervention. Participants indicated on a 7-point Likert scale the extent to which they agreed with six statements. For coach arm participants, the items referred to a coach (eg, “I believe my POWeR coach is aware of and notices when I use the website”) and for Web only participants, questions referred instead to “the POWeR team”. Higher scores indicated higher perceived accountability (Cronbach alpha=.70). Uptake of the two available coaching sessions was recorded by the coaches. Analysis Overview All analyses were conducted in SPSS version 20. Means and standard deviations were computed for continuous variables, and “n” and percentage were computed for categorical variables. We used an alpha level of .05 for all statistical tests. Primary Outcome: Intervention Usage and Between-Arm Differences For the primary analysis, we planned to conduct independent t tests to examine between-arm differences in mean number of sessions completed. However, due to highly skewed data, such analysis was inappropriate. Instead, and as recommended by Glasgow et al [ Glasgow RE, Christiansen SM, Kurz D, King DK, Woolley T, Faber AJ,  et al. Engagement in a diabetes self-management website: usage patterns and generalizability of program use. J Med Internet Res  2011;13(1):e9  [ FREE Full text ] [ CrossRef ] [ Medline ] 5 ], we computed a meaningful “threshold” usage dichotomous variable that indicated whether or not the participant had completed the core three POWeR sessions. Between-arm differences were then analyzed using a chi-square test. Secondary Outcome: Self-Reported Weight Loss and Between-Arm Differences To examine our between-arm differences in self-reported weight loss, we used ANCOVA (analysis of covariance), with follow-up weight as a dependent variable, baseline weight as a covariate, and trial arm as the independent variable. We performed an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis. Where weight at follow-up was missing, this was imputed using the “Multiple Imputation” procedure in SPSS. We performed 100 imputations using baseline variables and any available weight measurements as predictors. ANCOVA was performed and the pooled results from the multiple imputation reported. We also conducted a completers analysis by repeating another ANCOVA on the sample of participants who had completed follow-up measures. We also categorized participants according to whether or not they had lost at least 3 kg at 8-week follow-up. Such weight loss would correspond to approximately 0.4 kg (just under 1 lb) weight loss per week and would indicate a rate of weight loss in line with the POWeR program recommendations, which emphasize building healthy habits rather than rapid weight loss. We reported the percentage of participants in each arm meeting this criterion. We produced descriptive statistics to summarize coaching uptake and used t tests or chi-square tests to explore whether coach participants who had the full dose of coaching (ie, both sessions) differed from those who did not on baseline variables, sessions completed, weight loss, and Supportive Accountability. Results Participants Figure 1 shows flow of participants through the study. Between June 2012 and January 2013, 1131 users completed the initial step in the registration process. Of these, 786 (69.50%) subsequently returned to the website, completed the baseline questionnaires, and were randomized. A total of 275 participants (35.0%) were randomized to the control arm, 264 to POWeR only (33.6%), and 247 (31.4%) to POWeR plus coaching. The primary outcome, website usage, was successfully tracked for 100% of randomized participants. However, loss to follow-up was very high for the self-report measures. Full or partial self-report follow-up data at 8 weeks was provided by only 58.9% (162/275) of control, 15.2% (40/264) of POWeR only, and 21.5% (53/247) of POWeR plus coach participants. A total of 246 participants provided weight data at follow-up; 540 did not. Chi-square tests showed that missingness of weight data at 8 weeks was related to trial arm, with control participants more likely to provide data than participants in the two intervention arms. Looking within the two intervention arms, missingness was also related to website usage, with those having used POWeR the most (≥3 sessions) being more likely to provide follow-up data than those with lower usage (<3 sessions). Most baseline demographic, health, or weight-related variables were unrelated to missingness but participants who were older, less deprived, and university educated were more likely to provide follow-up data. All baseline variables, including those that were significantly associated with failure to provide follow-up data, were included as predictors in the multiple imputation model. \u200e Figure 1.  Flow of participants through the trial. View this figure Participant Characteristics Table 2 shows demographic and health characteristics of the sample. Participants were predominantly female, white British, and around half (444/786, 56.5%) were married. The age range of users was wide, with a mean of 44 years (SD 12.7). Overall, participants tended to live in fairly non-deprived areas, although scores ranged from deprived to fairly affluent. Few participants had problems with health literacy. Participants were mostly overweight and obese, with 15.0% (118/786) meeting criteria as morbidly obese and a minority (48/786, 6.1%) falling into the top end of the normal/healthy weight category. One-third (276/786, 35.1%) reported obesity-related health conditions (hypertension, diabetes, asthma, heart disease, or stroke). Roughly half (417/786, 53.1%) reported ever having been advised to lose weight by a health professional, around one-fifth (163/786, 20.7%) had ever been referred to a weight management program by a health professional, and just under half (383/786, 48.7%) said that they were currently or recently engaged in weight management attempts. One-way ANOVA (analysis of variance) and chi-square tests revealed no significant differences between groups at baseline on any of the sociodemographic, health, or weight-related variables.

Overall, the number of POWeR sessions completed was low. The median number of sessions completed was 1 in both the POWeR only and the POWeR plus coaching arm (IQR 0-2 for POWeR only, IQR 0-3 for POWeR plus coaching). The data were positively skewed because around one-third of participants (94/264, 35.6% of POWeR only; 80/247, 32.4% of POWeR plus coaching) never completed a session and many participants completed only one or two sessions. Nonetheless, a substantial minority completed at least the core three sessions of POWeR (ie, the meaningful usage threshold) ( Table 3 ). Those in the POWeR plus coaching arm were 1.61 times (95% CI 1.06-2.47) more likely to have continued to use POWeR until at least the end of the core three sessions (χ 2 1 =4.93; P =.026; n=511).

Overall, weight loss was highest in the coaching arm and lowest in the control arm. Between-arm differences were significant ( F 2,782 =34.02, P <.001). Post-hoc pairwise comparisons indicated that those in the coaching arm lost more weight than those in the control arm (mean difference 1.97 kg, P <.001, d =−.63, 95% CI −1.40 to 2.49). Those in the POWeR only arm also lost more weight than those in the control arm (mean difference 1.70 kg, P <.001, d =−.54, 95% CI 1.15-2.22). The difference between the POWeR plus coaching and the POWeR only arms was not significant (mean difference=0.27 kg, P =.676, d =−.08, 95% CI −0.29 to 0.81). The proportion of participants losing 3 kg or more was highest in the POWeR plus coaching arm and lowest in the control arm ( Figure 2 ). Weight data for the 246 follow-up completers is shown in ( Table 5 ). Between-arm differences in weight loss were significant ( F 2,242 =20.73, P <.001). Post-hoc pairwise comparisons indicated that differences were between the control and each of the active treatment arms (mean difference between POWeR only and control 2.49, P <.001, d =−.82, 95% CI −1.18 to −0.46 and between POWeR plus coaching and control 2.69, P <.001, d =−.89, 95% CI −1.22 to −0.5567), but not between the POWeR plus coaching and the POWeR only arms (mean difference 0.20 kg, P =.755, d =−.07, 95% CI −0.49 to 0.35). The proportion of completers losing 3 kg or more was highest in the POWeR plus coaching arm and lowest in the control arm ( Figure 2 ). In order to ensure that the ANCOVA results were not an artefact of an incorrect assumption about the normality of the data, we also conducted a non-parametric analysis using quantile regression and controlling for baseline weight. The results of this approach echoed those of the parametric analysis with a significantly lower median weight in the intervention groups than the control group ( P =.019 for the POWeR only group and P <.001 for the POWeR + coach group) but no statistically significant difference between intervention groups ( P =.207) Table 4.\n            Weight change by treatment arm (ITT analysis).

Percentage of participants self-reporting a weight loss of ≥3 kg at 8-week follow-up by treatment arm. View this figure Exploring Coaching Uptake Overall, uptake of coaching calls was low. More than half (57.9%, 143/247) of those in the POWeR plus coaching arm actually received no coaching calls. Of the 104 participants that had coaching, most (n=58, 55.8%) had just one call. Only 46 participants (18.6%, 46/247) received both calls (ie, a full dose of coaching as per protocol). When coaching calls occurred, they tended to last for roughly 7.5 minutes each. The low rate of coaching calls can be partially explained by participant withdrawal, as 54 (21.9%, 54/247) POWeR plus coaching arm participants withdrew during the 8-week study period (see Figure 1 ), but the remainder of those who did not receive coaching calls simply did not answer the phone calls. Compared to POWeR plus coaching participants who did not receive full coaching, participants that had the full “dose” of coaching (ie, both calls) tended to be older ( t 245 =−4.03, P <.001, d =−.66) and have higher baseline BMI ( t 245 =−2.13, P =.038, d =.35). They were 2.16 times more likely to have hypertension (χ 2 1 =4.38; P =.036; n=241) and 2.79 times more likely to have been referred to a weight loss scheme by a health professional (χ 2 1 =8.22; P =.004; n=238). Table 6 shows that overall, participants allocated to POWeR plus coaching who did not receive full coaching had usage and weight outcomes similar to (or slightly worse than) participants allocated to the Web-only arm. Compared to participants allocated to POWeR plus coaching who did not receive full coaching, those that did receive full coaching completed significantly more POWeR sessions ( t 55.186 =−5.78, P <.001, d =.94) and were 6.73 times more likely to have completed the core sessions (χ 2 1 =31.65 (n=247), P <.001). Their mean weight loss was 2.79 kg compared to 0.77 kg ( t 50.459 =3.82, P <.001, d =.623) and they were 5.12 times more likely to have lost 3 kg or more (χ 2 1 =19.75 (n=247), P <.001). Supportive Accountability scores were slightly, but not significantly higher between full coaching receivers/non-receivers ( t 50 =−1.38, P =.17, d =.38) and between all participants allocated to the coach arm and those in the Web arm ( t 90 =−1.14, P =.256, d =.24).

Discussion Engagement With the POWeR Intervention and Differences Between Groups In common with most studies of Web-based interventions [ Womble LG, Wadden TA, McGuckin BG, Sargent SL, Rothman RA, Krauthamer-Ewing ES. A randomized controlled trial of a commercial Internet weight loss program. Obes Res  2004 Jun;12(6):1011-1018. [ CrossRef ] [ Medline ] 9 , Hutchesson MJ, Collins CE, Morgan PJ, Callister R.

J Med Internet Res  2013;15(7):e129  [ FREE Full text ] [ CrossRef ] [ Medline ] 30 ], participants overall made suboptimal use of the intervention. However, usage was indeed improved, as predicted, by supplementing the website with brief phone calls focused on improving engagement. Despite the majority of the eHealth literature suggesting that human support is important for boosting engagement and outcomes [ Andersson G, Cuijpers P. Internet-based and other computerized psychological treatments for adult depression: a meta-analysis. Cogn Behav Ther  2009;38(4):196-205.

Telemed J E Health  2010 Nov;16(9):931-938  [ FREE Full text ] [ CrossRef ] [ Medline ] 21 ], several previous Web-based weight loss trials have found that providing more intense support did not make a significant difference to usage or outcomes [ Glasgow RE, Kurz D, King D, Dickman JM, Faber AJ, Halterman E,  et al.

Internet delivered behavioral obesity treatment. Prev Med  2010 Aug;51(2):123-128  [ FREE Full text ] [ CrossRef ] [ Medline ] 6 ]. One explanation for why our study did identify website usage differences between website plus coaching and website-only participants might be that our website-only condition was (in contrast to previous studies) a completely stand-alone intervention that was registered for and used without any contact with the research team or health professionals. Therefore, we were truly comparing a supported and an unsupported version. Another explanation is that, by explicitly basing our coaching around a theoretical framework that specifically seeks to delineate how to boost adherence and engagement with Web-based interventions, the human support we offered may have been more successful than that in previous studies. Self-Reported Weight Loss and Differences Between Groups Despite the overall pattern of light usage, in our secondary analyses of weight loss we showed that both of our intervention arms reported losing more weight than the control arm. Furthermore, a substantial minority of participants in the POWeR only and the POWeR plus coaching arm had high engagement with website sessions and reported losing clinically important amounts of weight (≥3 kg) at short-term follow-up. Hence, even though the effect sizes of the interventions were small overall, the impact at public health level could be considerable, given the low costs associated with entirely automated (POWeR only) or minimally-supported (POWeR plus coaching) Web-based interventions. Encouragingly, our exploratory analyses tentatively indicated that the higher engagement seen in the POWeR plus coaching arm may have been associated with improved effectiveness of the Web-based intervention. Differences in weight loss between the POWeR only and the POWeR plus coaching arm were not significant overall, but substantial effect sizes were observed when comparing participants in the coaching arm who actually received both coaching phone calls to those who did not. Uptake of Telephone Coaching The impact of coaching on both usage and weight loss outcomes is likely to have been reduced by low uptake, as less than one in five participants in the coaching arm actually received both phone calls. The reasons for low uptake of coaching are not entirely clear. Some participants might have welcomed the opportunity for coaching but were unreachable by telephone when the calls were attempted—even though coaches made several attempts to contact participants and tried to accommodate their preferred contact times. However, some participants may have found the prospect of coaching off-putting. Indeed, the higher rate of withdrawal from the study observed in the coach arm compared to the website-only arm (n=54 vs n=10) might be taken as an indication that some participants disliked the prospect of coaching. Although most participants did not provide a reason for their withdrawal (typically they simply emailed “please withdraw me from the POWeR study”), we noted that most withdrawals happened shortly after allocation to the coach arm, or around the time participants were expecting the first coaching call. This raises the possibility that offering coaching may have multiple impacts: for some, it may boost usage but for others it might actually increase the likelihood of attrition. Whether certain groups of Web intervention users would be more comfortable with and responsive to human support if it was provided through different channels is an interesting question, requiring further study. It may be that there are groups of users who would cease using the intervention, whatever support was provided, and some who actually prefer to have no human contact and see the privacy and independence associated with Web-based interventions as a benefit. A positive finding was that uptake of coaching calls was greatest among users who seemed particularly suitable candidates for weight management interventions (ie, more overweight, more likely to have hypertension, and to have been referred to a weight management program by a health professional). Future studies could build on this work to investigate further the users who are most likely to use and benefit from human support for Web interventions and how best to overcome barriers to uptake. While the current study focused on a telephone-based form of human support, different approaches to boosting engagement have either capitalized on more recent technology or have emphasized peer support as an alternative to a health professional or coach. For example, Web-based health interventions have made use of email contact [ Collins CE, Morgan PJ, Jones P, Fletcher K, Martin J, Aguiar EJ,  et al.

A social media-based physical activity intervention: a randomized controlled trial. Am J Prev Med  2012 Nov;43(5):527-532. [ CrossRef ] [ Medline ] 32 ]. Although some studies suggest these approaches may be promising in boosting usage, engagement, and outcomes, others suggest low uptake and lack of interest from users. Furthermore, these studies were not designed to isolate the influence of these supposed supportive features. We therefore do not yet have a substantial body of systematic research comparing interventions delivered with and without these supportive features and consequently have limited insight into likely uptake, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness. Supportive Accountability as a Mechanism for Boosting Engagement One of our study objectives was to explore whether coaching, based around the Supportive Accountability model [ Mohr DC, Cuijpers P, Lehman K. Supportive accountability: a model for providing human support to enhance adherence to eHealth interventions. J Med Internet Res  2011;13(1):e30  [ FREE Full text ] [ CrossRef ] [ Medline ] 14 ], increased participants’ perceived accountability for using the intervention. Although we did not detect a statistically significant between-group difference, this analysis may be underpowered due to high loss to follow-up. Indeed, effect sizes were consistent with a trend toward greater levels of perceived accountability in those who received coaching. Another explanation for not observing substantial between-group differences in accountability is that there may have been a ceiling effect, since perceptions of accountability were moderately high in both the coached and uncoached participants who responded to this questionnaire. The POWeR website itself and/or the context of participating in research may have instilled a certain level of accountability regardless of whether there was any coaching available. POWeR involves weekly self-monitoring and tailored feedback and has many interactive features and a human tone that may have been successful in promoting perceptions of accountability. Although recent eHealth research and reviews have highlighted contact with a human as important for boosting engagement and effectiveness [ Mohr DC, Cuijpers P, Lehman K. Supportive accountability: a model for providing human support to enhance adherence to eHealth interventions.

Telemed J E Health  2010 Nov;16(9):931-938  [ FREE Full text ] [ CrossRef ] [ Medline ] 21 ], some people may find it sufficient to use Web-based programs that effectively mimic some of the important aspects of human support, whether that be accountability, being treated as an individual, or feeling that somebody cares. Further research could seek to identify mechanisms through which human support offers additional benefits and explore whether well-designed and engaging website features can successfully simulate some of these features and processes. Strengths and Limitations A strength of this research is that our coaching protocols were well-documented, specific in their aims, and based on a theoretical model of engagement with digital interventions. Such explicit explanation of the aims and nature of human contact is rare in the reporting of Web-based interventions. Furthermore, the coach contact was brief (around 15 minutes for participants receiving the full dose) and delivered by providers with minimal training. This type of additional human support should be replicable in future studies and might prove feasible to implement and cost-effective for improving engagement and boosting intervention effectiveness even if effect sizes are modest. The current study benefited from having primary outcome data available from all participants (by automatically tracking website usage), allowing this analysis to include all randomized participants. However, our pragmatic research design, which included minimal contact between researchers and participants and which probably attracted participants who were curious but not committed to following an online weight management program, may have contributed to the very high loss to follow-up for the secondary outcome data collected via self-reported questionnaires. Low follow-up rates are common in Web-based intervention trials, especially when research methodologies are more in line with a pragmatic trial than an efficacy trial. However, the large amount of missing data at follow-up limited statistical power and reduced our ability to draw firm conclusions about change and group differences in the self-reported follow-up data. Therefore, our secondary and exploratory analyses based on these measures need to be interpreted with caution. Due to the large number and wide geographical dispersion of participants, only self-reported weight data could be obtained. Most Web-based weight loss trials have obtained objective weight data at face-to-face baseline and follow-up assessments [ Harvey-Berino J, West D, Krukowski R, Prewitt E, VanBiervliet A, Ashikaga T,  et al. Internet delivered behavioral obesity treatment. Prev Med  2010 Aug;51(2):123-128  [ FREE Full text ] [ CrossRef ] [ Medline ] 6 - Collins CE, Morgan PJ, Jones P, Fletcher K, Martin J, Aguiar EJ,  et al. A 12-week commercial Web-based weight-loss program for overweight and obese adults: randomized controlled trial comparing basic versus enhanced features. J Med Internet Res  2012;14(2):e57  [ FREE Full text ] [ CrossRef ] [ Medline ] 10 ]. Although in one respect self-reported weight data is a limitation of this study, on the other hand the absence of face-to-face assessment in this study allowed us to obtain website usage data in a context where there is no contact with a researcher. We believe that weight loss, website usage, and retention for follow-up in many existing Web weight loss trials may be influenced to some degree by the contact with researchers, the expectation of being weighed by the research team at a later date, and the perceptions of accountability and pressure this creates. In the current pragmatically-oriented study, we may have obtained a more representative view of users, usage patterns, and weight loss in contexts similar to what could be practical and affordable for a public health intervention. Furthermore, a recent study suggests that online self-reported weight tends to be reasonably accurate [ Harvey-Berino J, Krukowski RA, Buzzell P, Ogden D, Skelly J, West DS. The accuracy of weight reported in a Web-based obesity treatment program. Telemed J E Health  2011 Nov;17(9):696-699  [ FREE Full text ] [ CrossRef ] [ Medline ] 33 ]. Nonetheless, we cannot rule out the possibility that contact with the coach in the coaching arm may have influenced participants’ self-reporting of weight in some way, potentially leading to biased (possibly inflated) self-reports of weight loss at follow-up. However, given that testing the efficacy of POWeR for weight loss was not our main research question in this trial, we believe the self-report data remains a useful initial indicator of weight loss outcomes from using POWeR with and without coaching. This study chose to use the number of sessions completed as the indicator of participant engagement with the intervention. This has several advantages, including that it allowed us to obtain objective data unobtrusively for every participant and gave a reliable indication of the “dose” of the intervention that participants had been exposed to and which aspects they had seen. It is, however, not the only way to usefully investigate participant engagement and only gives a rudimentary picture of the extent to which participants were absorbing, understanding, and applying material presented on the Web pages. Future research may wish to use alternative ways of operationalizing engagement in order to investigate how deeply participants are engaging with intervention content. The challenge facing researchers, however, is how to measure engagement without relying on self-report follow-up data, which in many Web-based trials is unlikely to be provided by the majority of users. Conclusions In common with most Web-based intervention studies, usage of POWeR was suboptimal overall. Our findings suggest that supplementing Web-based weight management with brief human support might have a modest effect on persistence with the Web-based sessions, might improve weight loss outcomes, and could prove cost-effective. However, uptake of telephone support may be low overall, with particular types of users more likely to engage with it. Further research is needed to understand and optimize strategies to keep users engaged with Web-based weight interventions.

Physical activity (PA) and exercise training (ET) are associated with reduced CV risk, improved cardiometabolic risk factors, and facilitated weight loss through creating a negative energy balance. Clinicians need to counsel overweight and obese patients on how much PA/ET is needed to promote weight loss and weight loss maintenance. This will help establish realistic expectations and maximize improvements in CV risk factors. Although the minimum guidelines for aerobic PA (150\u202fmin of moderate or 75\u202fmin of vigorous physical activity per week) can improve CV health, these levels are generally inadequate for clinically significant weight loss or weight maintenance without caloric restriction . The purpose of this review is to evaluate the role of ET to promote clinically significant weight loss and promote weight maintenance. In particular, we will evaluate the likelihood of weight loss from ET programs composed of aerobic training only, resistance training only and programs that combine diet and ET. We will also explore the role of PA in promoting short-term and long-term weight maintenance. Section snippets Rationale for weight loss in overweight and obese individuals Given the high prevalence of obesity, weight loss is recommended by various health organizations to promote improvements in CV health. 25 The 2013 Guidelines for the Management of Overweight and Obesity 25 recommend weight reduction for overweight (BMI 25–30\u202fkg/m 2 ) individuals with one indicator of increased CV risk (e.g. dyslipidemia, pre-diabetes, hypertension, etc.) and obese individuals (BMI ≥30\u202fkg/m 2 ). While improvements in CV risk factors can be seen with modest weight loss of 2–3%,26., 27. Does aerobic ET alone result in clinically significant weight loss? The vast majority of the studies investigating the effects of aerobic ET on weight loss suggests that programs consistent with the minimum levels of PA recommendations (~150\u202fmin of moderate intensity ET) without dietary restriction may induce modest weight loss (~2–3\u202fkg), but in general are unlikely to result in clinically significant weight loss (≥5% weight loss). 26 , 37., 38., 39., 40. This finding has been demonstrated by the mean weight loss of large supervised ET randomized controlled trials Prevalence of clinically significant weight loss with aerobic ET While much of the data evaluating whether ET induces clinically significant weight loss from the mean change in weight, few studies have reported the prevalence of clinically significant weight loss following aerobic ET. In the MET 2 study, Donnelly et al. 42 observed a 45.9% and 62.2% prevalence of clinically significant weight loss in young adults exercising at 400 and 600\u202fkcal/session (5\u202fdays/week, 10-month intervention), respectively. In a secondary analysis from the DREW study, Swift et al. Cardiometabolic health benefits for weight loss and exercise training While the attainment of clinically significant weight loss is an important health metric, the cardiometabolic benefits accrued from weight loss are particularly important in the treatment of overweight and obese patients. An examination of participants in prospective studies that were able to achieve mean levels of weight loss of at least 5% suggests that improvements in several cardiometabolic risk factors (e.g. body fat, visceral fat, lipids, and insulin sensitivity) are observed for aerobic Combined exercise and dietary programs The optimal strategy for promoting weight loss is the combination of caloric restriction and adherence to adequate amounts of aerobic PA/ET. RCTs and meta-analyses that have examined the impact of weight loss programs composed of both exercise and dietary caloric restriction have shown greater weight loss compared to programs composed of exercise only.64., 65., 66., 67. Similarly, diet only programs produce larger weight loss than exercise only programs.64., 65., 66., 67. In the Nutrition and Resistance training and weight loss Resistance training alone is unlikely to produce a sufficient negative energy balance to result in clinically significant weight loss compared to aerobic training. Aerobic training sessions generally have a higher total energy expenditure compared to resistance training. In addition, potential gains in lean mass from resistance training can attenuate weight loss. 75 , 76 Therefore, patients attempting to lose weight using resistance training only should be encouraged to perform an aerobic training Physical activity level and weight maintenance Although obtaining significant weight loss is readily achievable, 80% of individuals are not able to maintain the weight loss. 82 The high rate of unsuccessful weight loss has public health importance given that even mild weight regain (2–6%) 83 has been associated with regression in major CV risk factors, such as total cholesterol, 84 , 85 LDL cholesterol, 85 , 86 TGs, 84 , 87 , 88 BP,87., 88., 89. glucose 84 , 85 , 90 and insulin levels. 86 , 89 Successful weight loss maintenance has been associated with reduced PA level and weight maintenance beyond 18\u202fmonths While much of the aforementioned studies focused on short-term weight maintenance (<2\u202fyears), a few prospective studies have looked at how PA level affects long-term maintenance. Data from the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) 100 evaluated 12\u202fmonths and 3\u202fyear weight loss in adults with high risk for DM. DPP participants had a goal of obtaining 7% weight loss and participating in at least 150\u202fmin/week of moderate intensity PA as part of a lifestyle modification program. At year 1 and year 3, Conclusions A strong rationale exists for the promotion of PA/ET and weight loss to reduce CV risk in overweight and obese patients. ET programs consistent with the minimum PA guidelines (150\u202fmin/week of moderate intensity PA or 75\u202fmin/week of vigorous intensity PA) are associated with CV health benefits. Patients seeking to lose weight without changing their dietary habits need to be counseled that high PA levels (225–420\u202fmin/week of exercise) are necessary to achieve clinically significant weight loss.

Therefore, dietary prescription plays a key role to create an energy deficit and facilitate fat mass loss (164). However, exercise may help to preserve lean mass (both muscle and bone) and functional performance during periods of energy restriction (165) and should be considered as an important supplement to nutritional approaches for those who endeavour to reduce adiposity. Show abstract The human ageing process is universal, ubiquitous and inevitable. Every physiological function is being continuously diminished. There is a range between two distinct phenotypes of ageing, shaped by patterns of living - experiences and behaviours, and in particular by the presence or absence of physical activity (PA) and structured exercise (i.e., a sedentary lifestyle). Ageing and a sedentary lifestyle are associated with declines in muscle function and cardiorespiratory fitness, resulting in an impaired capacity to perform daily activities and maintain independent functioning. However, in the presence of adequate exercise/PA these changes in muscular and aerobic capacity with age are substantially attenuated. Additionally, both structured exercise and overall PA play important roles as preventive strategies for many chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease, stroke, diabetes, osteoporosis, and obesity; improvement of mobility, mental health, and quality of life; and reduction in mortality, among other benefits. Notably, exercise intervention programmes improve the hallmarks of frailty (low body mass, strength, mobility, PA level, energy) and cognition, thus optimising functional capacity during ageing. In these pathological conditions exercise is used as a therapeutic agent and follows the precepts of identifying the cause of a disease and then using an agent in an evidence-based dose to eliminate or moderate the disease. Prescription of PA/structured exercise should therefore be based on the intended outcome (e.g., primary prevention, improvement in fitness or functional status or disease treatment), and individualised, adjusted and controlled like any other medical treatment. In addition, in line with other therapeutic agents, exercise shows a dose-response effect and can be individualised using different modalities, volumes and/or intensities as appropriate to the health state or medical condition. Importantly, exercise therapy is often directed at several physiological systems simultaneously, rather than targeted to a single outcome as is generally the case with pharmacological approaches to disease management. There are diseases for which exercise is an alternative to pharmacological treatment (such as depression), thus contributing to the goal of deprescribing of potentially inappropriate medications (PIMS). There are other conditions where no effective drug therapy is currently available (such as sarcopenia or dementia), where it may serve a primary role in prevention and treatment. Therefore, this consensus statement provides an evidence-based rationale for using exercise and PA for health promotion and disease prevention and treatment in older adults. Exercise prescription is discussed in terms of the specific modalities and doses that have been studied in randomised controlled trials for their effectiveness in attenuating physiological changes of ageing, disease prevention, and/or improvement of older adults with chronic disease and disability. Recommendations are proposed to bridge gaps in the current literature and to optimise the use of exercise/PA both as a preventative medicine and as a therapeutic agent. Exercise in the management of obesity 2019, Metabolism: Clinical and Experimental Show abstract Obesity is a multifactorial disease with increasing incidence and burden on societies worldwide. Obesity can be managed through everyday behavioral changes involving energy intake and energy expenditure. Concerning the latter, there is strong evidence that regular exercise contributes to body weight and fat loss, maintenance of body weight and fat reduction, and metabolic fitness in obesity. Appropriate exercise programs should ideally combine large negative energy balance, long-term adherence, and beneficial effects on health and well-being. Endurance training appears to be the most effective in this respect, although resistance training and high-intensity interval training play distinct roles in the effectiveness of exercise interventions. With weight regain being so common, weight loss maintenance is probably the greatest challenge in the successful treatment of obesity. There is an established association between higher levels of physical activity and greater weight loss maintenance, based on the abundance of evidence from prospective observational studies and retrospective analyses. However, proving a causative relationship between exercise and weight loss maintenance is difficult at present. Exercise has the potential to alleviate the health consequences of obesity, even in the absence of weight loss. All in all, exercise constitutes an indispensable, yet often underestimated, tool in the management of obesity.

Design Matched, prospective clinical intervention study to assess efficacy of varying ratios of carbohydrate and protein intake in conjunction with a regular exercise program. Participants One-hundred sixty one sedentary, obese, pre-menopausal women (38.5 ± 8.5 yrs, 164.2 ± 6.7 cm, 94.2 ± 18.8 kg, 34.9 ± 6.4 kg·m -2 , 43.8 ± 4.2%) participated in this study. Participants were weight stable and not participating in additional weight loss programs. Methods Participants were assigned to either a no exercise + no diet control (CON), a no diet + exercise group (ND), or one of four diet + exercise groups (presented as kcals; % carbohydrate: protein: fat): 1) a high energy, high carbohydrate, low protein diet (HED) [2,600; 55:15:30%], 2) a very low carbohydrate, high protein diet (VLCHP) [1,200 kcals; 63:7:30%], 3) a low carbohydrate, moderate protein diet (LCMP) [1,200 kcals; 50:20:30%] and 4) a high carbohydrate, low protein diet (HCLP) [1,200 kcals; 55:15:30%]. Participants in exercise groups (all but CON) performed a pneumatic resistance-based, circuit training program under supervision three times per week. Measurements Anthropometric, body composition, resting energy expenditure (REE), fasting blood samples and muscular fitness assessments were examined at baseline and weeks 2, 10 and 14. Results All groups except CON experienced significant reductions ( P < 0.05 – 0.001) in waist circumference over 14 weeks. VLCHP, LCHP and LPHC participants experienced similar but significant ( P < 0.05 – 0.001) reductions in body mass when compared to other groups. Delta responses indicated that fat loss after 14 weeks was significantly greatest in VLCHP (95% CI: -5.2, -3.2 kg), LCMP (-4.0, -1.9 kg) and HCLP (-3.8, -2.1 kg) when compared to other groups. Subsequent reductions in % body fat were significantly greater in VLCHP, LCMP and HCLP participants. Initial dieting decreased ( P < 0.05) relative REE similarly in all groups. All exercise groups significantly ( P < 0.05) improved in muscular fitness, but these improvements were not different among groups. Favorable but non-significant mean changes occurred in lipid panels, glucose and HOMA-IR. Leptin levels decreased ( P < 0.05) in all groups, except for CON, after two weeks of dieting and remained lower throughout the 14 week program. Exercise participation resulted in significant improvements in quality of life and body image. Conclusion Exercise alone (ND) appears to have minimal impact on measured outcomes with positive outcomes apparent when exercise is combined with a hypoenergetic diet. Greater improvements in waist circumference and body composition occurred when carbohydrate is replaced in the diet with protein. Weight loss in all diet groups (VLCHP, LCMP and HCLP) was primarily fat and stimulated improvements in markers of cardiovascular disease risk, body composition, energy expenditure and psychosocial parameters.

Initially, weight loss programs focused on restricting energy intake, but sharp reductions in energy intake have been shown to result in fat-free mass reductions and negatively impact metabolic rate [ 8 ]. Replacing dietary carbohydrate with protein without changing fat intake continues to be researched as a potential strategy to improve health and promote weight loss. While replacing dietary protein with fat in isocaloric amounts doesn't appear to improve the loss of body mass [ 9 – 11 ], studies in the last several years have shown that following diets which replace carbohydrate with protein may stimulate greater weight loss [ 12 , 13 ] and improve body composition changes [ 12 , 14 – 16 ]. Interestingly, findings have also reported that replacing dietary carbohydrate with protein may also improve serum-based markers of diabetes and cardiovascular disease (e.g. fasting insulin, glycemic responses, triglycerides and total cholesterol) [ 12 , 14 – 16 ]. While many of these studies examined a dietary intervention, several did not include any form of exercise component [ 14 – 16 ]. For those studies that did investigate a combination of dietary intake with and without exercise, some have lacked additional control measures to fully elucidate the impact of these dietary approaches when combined with a prolonged exercise intervention [ 12 , 13 ]. Furthermore, the mode of exercise is an important consideration, and the incorporation of some aspect of resistance-based exercise during a weight loss program may help to maintain fat free mass, sustain resting energy expenditure levels and promote higher levels of function [ 8 ]. Currently, the number of investigations that have combined a resistance-based exercise program with a dietary intervention that focuses on replacing carbohydrate with protein is limited [ 8 ], making it difficult to adequately determine which form of exercise and dietary intervention has the greatest potential to help people achieve their weight loss and other health-related goals. Curves International is currently the largest fitness franchise in the world with over 4 million members in 10,000 clubs in over 69 countries [ 17 ]. The typical Curves member is a 30 – 60 year old sedentary female who ranges from being slightly overweight to obese according to BMI standards [ 18 ]. The Curves program attracts a large segment of women to participate in their program who have many times previously avoided exercising at coed fitness facilities and unsuccessful with prior weight loss efforts [ 19 ]. Moreover, rather than incorporating traditional forms of aerobic exercise as the primary mode of physical activity, participants in the Curves program perform bi-directional, pneumatic resistance-training exercises (in a circuit format) interspersed with low-impact callisthenic exercises for 30-minutes, three times per week [ 19 ]. In conjunction with the exercise program, several dietary regimens are utilized throughout the program. A high calorie, high carbohydrate, low protein low fat diet (2,600 kcals: 55:15:30% (carbohydrate: protein: fat) is recommended for women who have low resting energy expenditure, defined as <10% below predicted RMR [ 20 ], and a low daily energy intakes. Otherwise, a low calorie, low carbohydrate, high protein, low fat diet (1,000 – 1,200 kcals: 20:50:30%) or a low calorie, high carbohydrate, low protein, low fat diet (1,000 – 1,200 kcals: 55:15:30%) is recommended depending on carbohydrate tolerance for an initial diet period of 2 – 4 weeks before increasing caloric intake to 1,600 kcals while maintaining a similar (but not identical) macronutrient distribution until weight loss goals are achieved. Once achieved, weight maintenance is promoted by adhering to a 2,200 – 2,600 kcals·d -1 diet based on American Dietetic Association guidelines (% carbohydrate:protein:fat = 55:15:30) with intermittent periods of reduced caloric intake (e.g. 1,200 kcals·d -1 ) for period of 2 to 3 days. This program was designed as a means to promote and sustain weight loss in women while preserving fat free mass and resting energy expenditure [ 19 ]. While previous research provides general conceptual support for this program, the safety and efficacy of the Curves program has yet to be investigated. Therefore, the objectives of this study were two-fold: 1) to examine the efficacy of replacing dietary carbohydrate with protein while completing a weekly resistance-based circuit exercise program and 2) to determine the safety and efficacy of following the Curves fitness and weight loss program [ 19 ] over a prolonged period. It was hypothesized that all groups participating in the exercise program, irrespective of dietary assignment, would experience significant improvements in anthropometric measures, body composition, and improve their fitness and risk for cardiovascular disease. Further hypotheses were made that those participants following diets that replaced dietary carbohydrate with protein would experience greater improvements in anthropometrics and body composition in addition to greater improvements in cardiovascular disease markers. Methods Experimental Approach Two primary objectives were studied in this investigation, first to examine the impact of replacing dietary carbohydrate with dietary protein to varying degrees and second to assess the effectiveness of following the exercise and diet recommendations of the Curves program that were published at the time this study was initiated [ 19 ]. Participants were placed into one of six groups: no diet + no exercise control (CON), no diet + exercise (ND), high carbohydrate, high energy diet (HED) + exercise (2,600; 55:15:30%); very low carbohydrate, high protein (VLCHP) + exercise (1,200; 63:7:30%), low carbohydrate, moderate protein (LCMP) + exercise (1,200: 50:20:30%), high carbohydrate, low protein (HCLP) + exercise group (1,200: 55:15:30%). All participants were tested over the course of a 14 week period for changes in anthropometrics, body composition, cardiovascular and muscular fitness, serum and whole clinical and hormonal changes and psychosocial parameters after 0, 2, 10, and 14 weeks of following their assigned diet and exercise program. Primary outcomes in this study were identified as waist circumference while all secondary outcomes were body mass and DXA body composition parameters. Finally, tertiary outcomes were associated with changes in resting energy expenditure, cardiovascular and muscular fitness and all serum and whole blood safety and hormonal markers. Testing after 2 weeks was completed to assess the acute changes in energy expenditure and hormonal status after the most energy-restrictive phase of the diets (1,200 kcals·d -1 ) while testing at 10 and 14 weeks provide for follow-up assessments after less-restrictive phases of the dieting program. Participation in the exercise program was hypothesized to promote greater improvements in all primary and secondary outcomes measures when compared to the non-exercise controls (CON). A standard consort diagram is available which outlines the number of participants who were screened (n = 290), assigned to a group (n = 242), including how many to each intervention group and those that completed the entire 14 week protocol (n = 161) (see Figure 1 ). Figure 1 Standard consort diagram illustrating people who provided interest in participating, those that were screened, how group assignments were made, who completed program and reasons for termination of participation . Full size image Participants One-hundred sixty one sedentary, obese, female participants (38.5 ± 8.5 yrs, 164.2 ± 6.7 cm, 94.2 ± 18.8 kg, 34.9 ± 6.4 kg·m -2 , 43.8 ± 4.2%) participated in this study (Table 1 ). Participants were not allowed to participate in this study if at baseline they reported: 1.) being currently diagnosed with any metabolic or cardiovascular disorder including known electrolyte abnormalities; heart disease, arrhythmias, diabetes, thyroid disease, hypogonadism; or a history of hypertension, hepatorenal, musculoskeletal, autoimmune, or neurologic disease; 2.) any current prescriptions for thyroid, hyperlipidemic, hypoglycemic, anti-hypertensive, or androgenic medications; 3.) taking any ergogenic levels of nutritional supplements that may affect muscle mass (e.g. creatine, β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate [HMB]), dehydroepiandrosterone [DHEA], or weight loss (e.g. ephedra, thermogenics, etc) within one year prior to the starting the study; 4.) any condition which classified them as high risk for cardiovascular disease according to American College of Sports Medicine criteria [ 21 ]; 5) participating in any other form of a diet or exercise program during the 12 months prior to starting the study. Participants meeting eligibility criteria were informed of the requirements of the study and signed informed consent statements in compliance with the Human Subjects Guidelines of Baylor University and the American College of Sports Medicine. Table 1 Baseline anthropometric, dietary analysis, body composition and biochemical parameters for the high energy, high carbohydrate diet + exercise (HED; 2,600: 55:15:30), no diet + exercise (ND), very low carbohydrate, high protein diet + exercise (VLCHP: 1,200; 63:7:30), low carbohydrate, moderate protein diet + exercise (LCMP: 1,200; 50:20:30), high carbohydrate, low protein diet + exercise (HCLP: 1,200; 55:15:30) and no diet + no exercise control (CON). Full size table Testing Sessions Recruitment occurred by flyers posted in local newspapers, campus flyers and television announcements. Interested participants first contacted the laboratory for pre-screening before completing a familiarization session where they were additionally screened and provided detailed information about the exercise program, diet and testing protocols. All participants completed informed consent documents during this familiarizations session. Prior to all testing sessions including baseline, participants completed a 4 d dietary record, observed an 8 h fast and refrained from vigorous physical activity for 24 h prior to each testing session. All testing sessions were scheduled at similar times in the morning to control for diurnal variations. All baseline, 10 week and 14 week testing sessions, respectively, were identical in nature and consisted of blood collection (blood lipids, metabolic panels), anthropometric assessments (body mass, body mass index, waist circumference), resting energy expenditure, muscular fitness and cardiorespiratory assessments, body composition analysis (DXA) and psychosocial assessments (e.g. short-form-36 (SF-36) quality of life, social physique anxiety scale (SPA), Rosenberg self-esteem scale (RSE), Cash Body Image questionnaire). An additional testing session occurred after 2 weeks of dieting and consisted of all baseline measures with the exception of cardiorespiratory and muscular fitness assessments. Upon completion of baseline testing, all participants, with the exception of the no exercise control group (CON), began a thrice weekly 30 min pneumatic circuit-style resistance-based circuit exercise program interspersed with callisthenic activities. During each workout, fitness supervisors provided exercise instruction and assisted with self-monitoring of heart rate to maintain an exercise heart rate between 60–80% target heart rate using age-predicted maximal heart rate (220 – age) and the Karvonen method. Diet Assignments Upon completion of baseline testing, participants were matched according to body mass and age into either a no diet + no exercise control (CON), a no diet + exercise group (ND), or one of four dietary regimens. The diets followed the Curves diet recommendations at the time this study was conducted [ 19 ] and consisted of replacing dietary carbohydrate with dietary protein while keeping dietary fat intake standardized at 30% of total daily caloric intake [ 14 ]. Participant's whose measured REE was less than 90% of predicted REE (no activity factor was incorporated) using the Harris-Benedict prediction equation [ 22 ] were categorized as hypo-metabolic [ 23 ]. They were assigned to follow a 2,600 kcals·d 1 at a macronutrient ratio of 55:15:30% (carbohydrate:protein:fat), high-energy, high carbohydrate diet (HED) for 14 weeks to assess anthropometric and weight loss changes. A brief questionnaire was administered to all participants at familiarization to provide a qualitative indication of carbohydrate/glycemic tolerance, which is used by the Curves program to assist with dietary assignment and thus was adopted as part of this investigation [ 19 ]. Recent studies by our group have illustrated that in a large group of overweight and obese women this questionnaire effectively associates responses with indicators of metabolic syndrome [ 24 , 25 ]. Those participants responding in a positive fashion (e.g. provided answers indicative of carbohydrate intolerance) were assigned to either the VLCHP or LCMP groups. Participants responding negatively were assigned to the HCLP diet [ 19 ]. In each of these diets, participants ingested 1,200 kcals·d -1 for 2-weeks (phase 1). Over the next 8-weeks, energy intake was increased to 1,600 kcals·d -1 (phase 2) providing for a weight loss period of 10 weeks consisting of caloric intakes ranging from 1,200 – 1,600 kcals·d -1 . The remaining 4 weeks (phase 3) utilized a weight maintenance approach in which participants followed a 2,600 kcals·d -1 using the recommend macronutrient breakdown (55:15:30%; carbohydrate: protein: fat) by the American Dietetic Association with intermittent 2 – 3 day periods of phase 1 dieting. Similar weight maintenance models have been previously investigated [ 14 ] for their effectiveness and this approach is utilized as a weight maintenance approach during this program. To facilitate adherence and comprehension of each dietary assignment, a team of reregistered dieticians performed an additional diet familiarization session with each participant and developed customized menu booklets, providing sample diets and food substitutions for each diet phase. The booklets were used as checklists upon which all study participants were required to return after completing the study. Food logs were maintained for 4 days prior to each testing session. Registered dietitians reviewed the dietary records with the participant to promote compliance to the diet programs. Procedures Dietary Inventories Prior to each testing session, participants recorded all food and fluid intake over a 4-d period (including one weekend day), which was reflective of their normal dietary intake. Dietary inventories were then reviewed by a registered dietician and analyzed for average caloric and macronutrient intake using ESHA Food Processor (Version 8.6) Nutritional Analysis software (Salem, OR). Anthropometrics Each testing session, height and body mass were determined according to standard procedures using a Healthometer (Bridgeview, IL) self-calibrating digital scale with an accuracy of ± 0.02 kg. Waist circumference was measured using a Golnick tensiometer using standard ACSM criteria [ 21 ]. Resting heart rate was measured via palpation of the radial artery and resting blood pressure was determined using a mercury sphygomometer (American Diagnostic Corporation, model # AD-720, Hauppuage, NY) according to previously accepted procedures [ 21 ]. Body Composition and Energy Expenditure Assessments Resting energy expenditure (REE) assessments were made using a Parvo Medics TrueMax 2400 Metabolic Measurement System (Sandy, UT). This test was a non-exertional test performed in a fasted state with the participants lying supine on an exam table. A clear, hard plastic hood and soft, clear plastic drape was placed over the participants' neck and head in order to determine resting oxygen uptake and energy expenditure. All participants remained motionless without falling asleep for approximately 20 minutes. Data were recorded after the first ten minutes of testing during a five minute period of time in which criterion variables (e.g. VO 2 [Lmin -1 ]) changed less than 5% [ 26 ]. Using a sub-sample of 14 participants from this investigation, test-retest correlations ( r ) of collected VO 2 in L·min 1 ranged from 0.315 – 0.901 ( : 0.638) and coefficient of variation ranged from 8.2% – 12.0% ( : 9.9%) with a mean intra-class coefficient of 0.942, p < 0.001. Participants then had their bone density and body composition assessed with a whole-body scan using a Hologic QDR-4500W DXA using software version 9.8 (Waltham, MA). Mean coefficients of variation in bone mineral content and bone mineral density measurements on the spine phantom ranged between 0.41 – 0.55%. Test-retest reliability studies performed on male athletes with this DXA machine have previously yielded mean coefficients of variation for total bone mineral content and total fat free/soft tissue mass of 0.31 – 0.45% with a mean intra-class correlation of 0.985 [ 27 ]. Cardiopulmonary Exercise Tests At baseline and after 10 and 14 weeks, participants completed a peak cardiopulmonary exercise test according to the Bruce protocol [ 28 ]. Using standard electrode placement and a Quinton 710 ECG unit (Bothell, Washington, USA), 12-lead electrocardiogram tests were also made to assess heart function according to previously established criteria [ 21 ]. An exercise heart rate of 85% of predicted maximal heart rate was criteria used to standardized exertion during each test. Standard ACSM test termination criteria were monitored and followed throughout each test [ 21 ]. Resting and exercise expired gases were collected using a Parvo Medics TrueMax 2400 Metabolic Measurement System (Sandy, Utah, USA). Calibration of gas and flow sensors was completed every morning prior to testing and was found to be within 3% of the previous calibration point. Maximal Strength and Endurance Assessments At baseline and after 10 and 14 weeks, participants had their one-repetition maximum (1 RM) determined using the bench press and leg press exercises for changes in maximal strength. Muscular endurance was assessed by having participants perform as many repetitions as possible with 80% of their pre-determined 1 RM. Standard lifting techniques and criteria according to National Strength and Conditioning Association (NSCA) were followed throughout all testing [ 29 ]. Test to test reliability of performing these strength tests in our lab on resistance-trained participants have yielded low mean coefficients of variation and high reliability for the bench press (1.9%, intra-class r = 0.94) and hip sled/leg press (0.7%, intra-class r = 0.91). Blood Collection Procedures Fasted whole blood and serum samples were collected using standard phlebotomy techniques. Whole blood samples were analyzed for complete blood counts with platelet differentials using an Abbott Cell Dyn 3500 (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, Illinois, USA) automated hematology analyzer. Serum samples were analyzed for a complete metabolic and thyroid panel including ketone assessment of beta-hydroxybutyrate using a calibrated Dade Behring Dimension RXL (Deerfield, Illinois, USA) automated clinical chemistry analyzer. Coefficient of variation for the tests using this analyzer was similar to previously published data for these tests (range: 1.0 to 9.6%) [ 30 ]. Remaining serum was assayed using standard commercially available (DS Laboratories, Webster, Texas, USA) enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assays (ELISAs) for leptin and insulin. Serum concentrations were assessed in duplicate using a Wallac-Victor IV (Perkin-Elmer Life Sciences, Boston, Massachusetts, USA) micro plate reader at an optical density of 450 nm against a known standard curve using standard ELISA procedures. Intra- and inter-assay CVs of 5.4 – 6.9 and 3.8 – 7.3% at ~5.0 – 21.1 ng·mL -1 existed for leptin and 1.3 – 2.6 and 5.2 – 6.2% at ~7.84 – 44.23 μIU·ml -1 for insulin, respectively. Psychosocial Assessments Prior to any testing, participants completed the SF-36 Health-Related Quality of life (QOL) inventory [ 31 ], social physique anxiety scale (SPA) [ 32 ], Rosenburg self-esteem scale (RSE) [ 33 ], and a Cash body image questionnaire [ 34 ]. Exercise Program With the exception of the CON group, all participants participated in a supervised Curves exercise program three days per week throughout the fourteen week protocol (a total of 42 workouts). Each circuit-style workout consisted of 14 exercises (e.g. elbow flexion/extension, knee flexion/extension, shoulder press/lat pull, hip abductor/adductor, chest press/seated row, horizontal leg press, squat, abdominal crunch/back extension, pec deck, oblique, shoulder shrug/dip, hip extension, side bends and stepping) constructed with pneumatic or hydraulic resistance that targeted opposing muscle groups in a concentric-only fashion. Participants were informed of proper use of all equipment and were instructed to complete as many repetitions in a 30 s time period. In a continuous, interval fashion, participants performed floor-based callisthenic (e.g. running/skipping in place, arm circles, etc.) exercises for a 30 s time period after each resistance exercise in an effort to maintain a consistent exercise heart rate that corresponded to 60% to 80% of their maximum heart rate [ 21 ]. All workouts were supervised by trained fitness instructors who assisted with proper exercise technique and maintenance of adequate exercise intensity. Participants were required to complete two complete circuits which corresponded to exercising for approximately 28 minutes followed by a standardized whole-body stretching routine. Compliance to the exercise program was set a priori at a minimum of 70% compliance (30/42 exercise sessions). Participants were allowed to add an additional workout on a non-consecutive day to assist with maintaining appropriate exercise compliance and in rare instances (n<5), an additional week was added to the intervention. Statistical Analysis All data are presented as means and 95% CI for all variables for the CON, ND, HED, VLCHP, LCMP and HCLP groups, respectively. All nutritional intake data was normalized to kilograms of body mass and analyzed using 5 × 4 (without ND group) repeated measures ANOVA. Eleven participants completed all training and testing, but did not turn in accurate food records. Consequently, all statistical analysis of nutritional intake was made on the remaining 143 participants from the original dataset as individuals in the CON group (n = 7) completed dietary analysis at weeks 0 and 14 and were not included in the statistical analysis. Resting energy expenditure was analyzed using a 6 × 4 (group × test [0, 2, 10 and 14 weeks]) ANCOVA for baseline body mass. All remaining data were analyzed using 6 × 3 (group × test [0, 10 and 14 weeks]) repeated measures ANOVA. 14-week change from baseline (delta) values were calculated and a mean with 95% confidence interval was instructed to assess changes over time. When significant group × time interaction effects were found, factor analysis of the main effects was determined using pairwise comparisons and one-way ANOVA when appropriate. Select Pearson correlations were calculated between the psychosocial and body composition variables to identify any relationships between these groups of data. Percent change from baseline was calculated and reported to evaluate any changes in this data. Post-hoc power analysis all primary and secondary outcomes (e.g., waist circumference, body mass, body composition via DXA) revealed observed powers values ranging from 0.821 – 0.998 with partial eta-squared values ranging from 0.062 – 0.115. All statistical decisions were made using an alpha level of 0.05. Individual responses are plotted for waist circumference, body mass, DEXA fat mass and triglyceride changes while groups mean are graphed for changes in absolute REE with the mean and 95% confidence interval offset next to each figure. Results Nutritional Intake With the exception of the control group (CON) and the exercise only group (ND), all participants were provided a diet that provided the desired percentage of carbohydrate, protein, fat and energy intake. Participants completed 4 day dietary recalls after 0, 2, 10 and 14 weeks of following their assigned diet and the exercise program. Results show that participants in the diet groups reduced their energy intake throughout the program (Time effect: P < 0.001; G × T; P = 0.10) and altered carbohydrate (G × T; P = 0.001), protein (G × T; P = 0.01) and fat intake (G × T; P = 0.04) as intended. Mean values of energy intake, however, revealed that while participants did alter their diets and followed the designed patterns, the anticipated caloric intake for some groups (i.e., particularly the HED group) did not achieve the intended levels, but this did not influence the study's ability to investigate the impact of altering macronutrient ratios in a diet while exercising. Anthropometrics and Body Mass Waist circumference decreased in the HED, VLCHP and LCMP after 14 weeks (P < 0.001 for all groups, respectively). After 14 weeks, significant time effects for waist circumference were found in all groups except CON (Table 2 ). As expected, when comparing all groups who exercised against those who did not exercise (CON), a significant group × time interaction was found for changes in waist circumference (Figure 2 ; P < 0.05). After 10 weeks, those participants who restricted caloric intake and exercised experienced a significantly greater loss of body mass than HED, ND and CON ( P < 0.01; Figure 3 ). Participants following the VLCHP diet experienced significantly greater body mass loss in comparison to the ND ( P < 0.005) and CON ( P < 0.005) diets. Similar findings were found for those individuals following the LCMP diet when compared to the ND ( P < 0.005) and CON ( P < 0.05) groups. Loss of body mass for the HCLP approached significance when compared to the ND ( P = 0.077) and CON ( P = 0.095) groups, but were subsequently not significant. Furthermore, all participants maintained their body mass over the last four weeks of the investigation (Table 2 ; P = 0.63). Table 2 Anthropometric, body mass, body composition and energy expenditure changes for the high energy, high carbohydrate diet + exercise (HED; 2,600: 55:15:30), no diet + exercise (ND), very low carbohydrate, high protein diet + exercise (VLCHP: 1,200; 63:7:30), low carbohydrate, moderate protein diet + exercise (LCMP: 1,200; 50:20:30), high carbohydrate, low protein diet + exercise (HCLP: 1,200; 55:15:30).

Full size image Body Composition Body composition was assessed at 0, 10 and 14 weeks to determine changes in fat-free and fat mass (Table 2 ). All groups that restricted caloric intake and exercised (VLCHP, LCMP, HCLP) experienced significant but similar within group reductions over time in DXA fat-free mass. Similar changes in DXA fat mass (Figure 4 ) were found in VLCHP, LCMP and HCLP after both 10 weeks and 14 weeks which resulted in an overall reduction of DXA % body fat in the VLCHP, LCMP and HCLP groups at both 10 weeks and 14 weeks (Table 2 ). DXA fat reductions in the VLCHP group were significantly greater after 14 weeks when compared to HED, ND and CON ( P < 0.05). Figure 4 Delta change in DXA fat mass (kg) at 14 weeks .

Full size image Energy Expenditure Fasting resting energy expenditure (REE) measurements were obtained at 0, 2, 10 and 14 weeks (not all data is shown) to determine changes in resting energy expenditure (Figure 5 and Table 2 ). To control for the influence of baseline body mass on REE, analysis of the absolute resting energy expenditure data was performed using an ANCOVA and revealed no overall significant group × time interaction effect ( P = 0.45) although significant within-group increases occurred over time for the HED, ND and HCLP groups. As expected due to the relationship between energy intake and expenditure, oneway ANOVA revealed significantly greater increases from baseline after 2, 10 and 14 weeks ( P < 0.001 at all three time points) in absolute REE for the HED group when compared to all other groups (Figure 5 and Table 2 ). Figure 5 Delta change in absolute resting energy expenditure (kcal·d -1 ) at 14 weeks .

Full size image Cardiovascular and Muscular Fitness Changes At baseline and after 14 weeks of following the diet and exercise programs, all participants completed maximal strength and muscular endurance assessments (Table 3 ). As expected, exercise training significantly increased relative peak oxygen uptake in VLCHP ( P < 0.001), LCMP ( P < 0.01) and HCLP ( P < 0.001) while mean reductions in resting heart rate (-3.3 ± 16.5%; P = 0.01), systolic blood pressure (-2.8 ± 12.5%; P = 0.02), mean arterial pressure (-3.4 ± 10%) and rate pressure product (-5.8 ± 20%) occurred in these groups (data not shown). No significant group × time interaction effect was found for bench press ( P = 0.44) or leg press 1 RM ( P = 0.38), although those groups that participated in the exercise program did achieve significant increases ( P < 0.05–0.001) in relative bench press and leg press 1 RM while CON did not experience changes in either bench press ( P = 0.59) or leg press 1 RM ( P = 0.54), respectively. No significant differences were observed among those groups that exercised for 14 weeks suggesting that all dietary regimens equally impacted adaptations to exercise training. Table 3 Cardiorespiratory and muscular fitness changes for the high energy, high carbohydrate diet + exercise (HED; 2,600: 55:15:30), no diet + exercise (ND), very low carbohydrate, high protein diet + exercise (VLCHP: 1,200; 63:7:30), low carbohydrate, moderate protein diet + exercise (LCMP: 1,200; 50:20:30), high carbohydrate, low protein diet + exercise (HCLP: 1,200; 55:15:30). Full size table Lipid Panels Lipid panels (e.g. triglycerides, total cholesterol, LDL and HDL cholesterol) were completed at weeks 0 and 14 (Table 4 ). No significant interactive effects for total cholesterol ( P = 0.90), triglycerides ( P = 0.31), HDL cholesterol ( P = 0.78), and LDL cholesterol ( P = 0.54) values were found in any group. Significant reductions in total cholesterol were found after 14 weeks for found for the VLCHP and HCLP groups. Furthermore, significant but similar within group increases in HDL cholesterol were seen for VLCHP, LCMP and HCLP, but not the HED, ND or CON groups. Table 4 Lipid panel, glucose, insulin, HOMA and leptin changes for the high energy, high carbohydrate diet + exercise (HED; 2,600: 55:15:30), no diet + exercise (ND), very low carbohydrate, high protein diet + exercise (VLCHP: 1,200; 63:7:30), low carbohydrate, moderate protein diet + exercise (LCMP: 1,200; 50:20:30), high carbohydrate, low protein diet + exercise (HCLP: 1,200; 55:15:30). Full size table Markers of Fuel Utilization and Energy Regulation Using serum samples collected at 0 and 14 weeks, serum concentrations of glucose, insulin, leptin, ketones and a homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) were determined (Table 4 ) [ 35 ]. No significant interactive effects were found for glucose ( P = 0.68) and ketones ( P = 0.40), while serum glucose levels were decreased ( P < 0.001) in the HCLP group. Serum insulin ( P = 0.08) and HOMA-IR ( P = 0.06) values approached significance for the HCLP group, but were not significant. Significant within-group reductions in HOMA-IR were found for the VLCHP, but no other groups (Table 4 ). A significant group × time interaction was found for serum leptin ( P < 0.05), with significant reductions occurring after the initial phase of dietary restriction. In this respect, leptin levels for all groups except CON ( P = 0.07) experienced significant reductions ( P < 0.001 to <0.05) after the first two weeks of dieting, which restricted caloric intake to the greatest extent. Clinical Safety Markers Serum and whole blood safety panels were analyzed from fasting blood after 0 and 14 weeks. While some hematological variables did report main effects over time with no significant interaction effects, none of these changes occurred outside of the clinically accepted normative values for these variables [ 36 ] and thus are not being reported. No significant main or interaction effects ( P > 0.05) were found for found kidney/liver enzymes (e.g. AST, ALT, GGT, Alk Phos) and markers of protein breakdown (e.g. Uric Acid, BUN, creatinine, BUN:creatinine ratio, creatine kinase). Psychosocial Results Individual QOL subscales were completed at baseline and after 10 and 14 weeks and are presented as delta values for 0 and 14 weeks, respectively. Physical functioning (W0: 6.7 ± 22; W14: 9.3 ± 19), bodily pain (W0: 6.1 ± 30; W14: 4.9 ± 25), general health (W0: 8.3 ± 14; W14: 8.4 ± 15), vitality (W0: 11.2 ± 15; W14: 11.9 ± 14), and mental health (W0: 6.3 ± 13; W14: 7.3 ± 14) scores significantly increased (all P < 0.05) in exercising individuals (all groups except CON and ND) independent of dietary assignment. Similarly, role emotional scores (W0: -13.2 ± 43; W14: -16.5 ± 44) were significantly ( P < 0.05) decreased while social functioning scores were unchanged ( P > 0.05). No significant ( P > 0.05) correlations were found between the changes in the QOL subscales and anthropometric (e.g. waist circumference) and body composition (e.g. body mass and DXA parameters) variables. Body image assessment revealed significant ( P < 0.05) percent increases from baseline in exercising individuals irrespective of dietary assignment after 10 and 14 weeks, respectively, for appearance evaluation (W10: 50.5 ± 20; W14: 50.0 ± 20%), appearance orientation (W10: 6.6 ± 32; W14: 6.1 ± 32%), body area satisfaction scale (W10: 23.7 ± 19; W14: 14.7 ± 29%), and overweight preoccupation (W10: 20.1 ± 31; W14: 17.8 ± 34%) while self-classified weight (SCW) did not change. No changes ( P > 0.05) occurred for any diet or exercise group for the Rosenberg self-esteem scale and the social physique anxiety scale. Changes in DXA fat mass were ( P < 0.05) correlated with body area satisfaction and self-classified weight scores while changes in percent body fat correlated ( P < 0.05) with appearance evaluation, appearance orientation, body area satisfaction, self-classified weight and social physique anxiety values. Discussion The purpose of this study was two-fold: 1) to determine the impact of replacing dietary carbohydrate with dietary protein and 2) to determine the impact of the Curves fitness and weight loss program on weight loss, body composition, energy expenditure, psychosocial outcomes, and markers of health in sedentary, obese females. This study represents the first of a series of studies by our research group to examine the effectiveness of the Curves fitness and weight loss program which is currently being followed by millions of women worldwide. Although our study contains many strengths such as our overall sample size, supervised exercise, dietary control measures and inclusion of exercise-only and no exercise/no diet controls, the marked difference in sample size among groups presents some challenges with interpreting our findings. While the authors acknowledge increasing the sample size in these groups would have been helpful, the primary objective was to assess the impact of altering the macronutrient ratio of the dietary regimens while also examining the overall impact of the exercise and diet programs used by the Curves system. Furthermore, statistical power analysis of our primary (e.g. waist circumference) and secondary outcomes (e.g. body mass and DXA body composition variables) ranged from 0.821 – 0.998 with partial eta squared values of 0.062 – 0.115 suggesting that our statistical analysis were adequately powered for our a priori determined end points. Our initial hypothesis was that participation in the exercise program would promote weight loss, improve body composition and fitness along with reducing markers of cardiovascular disease and that following a diet which restricted caloric intake while replacing dietary carbohydrate with protein at controlled fat intake levels would result in greater weight loss and improvements in health. Results from this study show that the greatest changes did occur in those groups that restricted their caloric intake in combination with the exercise program while participation in just the exercise program appears to have little to no effect over weight loss and body composition changes, a finding previously reported [ 8 ]. Results from the dietary analysis revealed significant differences in energy intake and carbohydrate and protein intake between dietary phases (e.g. Phase I, Phase II, etc.) and dietary groups (e.g. VLCHP and LCMP vs. HCLP). Overall dietary compliance during the 14 week program was deemed successful in all diet groups with the exception of the HED group, where it appears this group struggled to consume their prescribed level of calories (actual mean intake of 1846.6 ± 366.6 kcals·d 1 vs. prescribed intake of 2,600 kcals·d -1 ). Caloric intake in this group, however, was higher by an average of 193 kcals·d -1 , when compared to VLCHP, LCMP and HCLP. This allowed for comparison to lower and caloric intakes while exercising, which was the main premise for this higher dietary prescription, albeit not to the degree we originally hoped. This is likely due to either under-reporting or the inherent error associated with using dietary food records as recent studies from our laboratory have suggested that the magnitude of error associated with self-reporting of food intake is greater when higher caloric intakes are being prescribed [ 37 , 38 ]. An additional important note is that although women in the moderate and high protein diet groups consumed a high percentage of calories in the form of protein, the relative intakes of this macronutrient ranged from 0.9 to 1.1 grams PRO·kg -1· d -1 , respectively, suggesting that overall protein intake was increased above RDA guidelines. Waist circumference is a key predictor of diabetes and cardiovascular disease [ 39 ]. Findings from the present study suggest that participation in a resistance-based circuit exercise program can significantly reduce waist circumference irrespective of what dietary regimen is being followed. Further when dietary carbohydrate is replaced with protein, greater decreases in waist circumference may result (VLCHP: = -6.3: [-8.7, -3.8]; LCMP: = -6.7: [-8.7, -4.8]; HCLP: = -5.7: [-7.5, -3.9]), but these between-group differences were not significant (Figure 2 and Table 2 ). Regarding weight loss, significant reductions in body mass were found in all groups that followed a diet and participated in the exercise program in amounts similar to recently published investigations [ 40 , 41 ]. As expected, the greatest reductions in body mass occurred in those groups that restricted their calories to the greatest extent and for the longest period of time (VLCHP, LCMP and HCLP), but there were no differences between the amount of lost in the HCLP when compared to VLCHP and LCMP. These findings are consistent with other investigations that investigated the impact of macronutrient content on weight loss in diabetic and non-diabetic populations with no exercise intervention [ 14 , 41 – 43 ]. Further, findings from Layman [ 12 ] suggested that a higher intake of protein with or without exercise was responsible for greater total weight loss [ 12 ]. In the present study, participants following the VLCHP and LCMP programs experienced greater but non-significant levels of body mass and fat mass loss when compared to the HCLP group. Similar reductions (all P < 0.001) occurred in fat-free mass for VLCHP, LCMP and HCLP, while significant reductions in percent body fat were still found in all three groups. These findings contrast with other studies that have suggested higher protein diets may preferentially help to preserve lean tissue [ 12 , 15 ] in those individuals who have replaced dietary carbohydrate intake with protein. Many reasons exist as to why differences in these findings exist, most notably subtle differences in the diet and exercise interventions. Nevertheless, present findings demonstrate the ability to lose a large percentage of weight as fat while maintaining a large amount of fat free mass while dieting and exercising [ 7 , 16 ] and to a greater extent than other control conditions. Reductions in energy expenditure have been reported in conjunction with restriction of caloric intake [ 42 , 44 ]. This down-regulation has subsequently been linked to difficulties with weight maintenance as well as regaining the lost body mass over time [ 8 ]. Consistent with many prior reports, significant reductions in REE occurred after consuming 1,200 kcal·d -1 for the first two weeks of the present study, even in conjunction with exercise. Caloric intake was increased by 400 kcals·d 1 for the next 8 weeks which increased REE back to baseline levels in all groups except HED as this group experienced further increases in REE (Figure 5 ). A slight increase in energy intake during the following 8 weeks to 1,600 kcals·d 1 (which was close to mean daily REE) stimulated increases in REE despite participants losing a significant amount of weight and fat mass. In these groups, REE was further increased when participant's began ingesting a 2,600 kcal: 55:15:30 diet with intermittent dieting (6 days out of 31) at their previously followed energy and macronutrient levels similar to previous energy balance approaches used in the literature [ 14 ]. Collectively, these findings suggest that relative levels of energy expenditure can be maintained while completing a weekly resistance-based circuit training program in conjunction with modest caloric restriction (phase II) or potentially even intermittent dieting (Phase III). As hypothesized, all groups except CON experienced improvements in peak oxygen uptake and maximal strength levels (Table 3 ) in accordance with other studies which have employed a regular exercise program to overweight/obese and/or sedentary populations [ 7 , 40 ]. Minimal studies have incorporated a circuit-style resistance mode of exercise to this population, thus providing evidence that this type of training promotes general improvements in fitness in this population. Additionally, the serum reductions in glucose (2.6%), total cholesterol (2.5%) and LDL cholesterol (2.8%) were significant and similar to other studies which have employed dietary regimens that replace dietary carbohydrate in favor of greater dietary protein (Table 4 ) [ 45 ]. While no significant group × time effect was found for insulin ( P = 0.08), individuals in the VLCHP and LCMP groups experienced significant reductions, providing continued support that higher intakes of protein may help to promote such changes [ 14 ]. A weakness of our study design is the inherent nature of pneumatic resistance. Such exercise modes make it impossible to determine how much resistance is actually being applied and subsequently creates challenges for documenting changes in total work throughout the exercise program in all groups. In this regard, it is possible that the total work completed from workout to workout and week to week didn't change or even decreased, although the physiological adaptations which did occur make this unlikely. For this reason, heart rate and ratings of perceived exertion were monitored throughout every exercise session in an attempt to promote consistency from workout to workout, while the number of completed repetitions were recorded to promote adequate progression. It was suggested that as fitness parameters increased each individual's ability to complete work would also be subsequently increased. Although each workout was intermittent in nature, heart rate monitoring did successfully keep individual workouts in the same relative range of exercise intensity The relationship of leptin to weight loss, energy expenditure and insulin sensitivity has been characterized [ 3 , 46 , 47 ]. In this regard, circulating levels of leptin have been shown to decrease in response to decreases in energy availability [ 46 ], however, the influence of exercise and alterations in the macronutrient ratio is still undetermined. Volek and colleagues [ 3 ] suggested that significant decreases in leptin occur as part of an 8-week weight loss program, which similarly occurred in the present study. Further, Sartorio et al. [ 46 ] used a combination of energy-restricted diets with a 5 d·wk -1 aerobic and anaerobic exercise program and reported an acute, significant reduction in leptin levels which closely mimicked changes in body mass. As observed in the Sartorio study, serum leptin changes in the present study mimicked body mass changes and significantly decreased in all groups (except CON) after 2 weeks (Table 4 ). No significant changes occurred in any diet or exercise groups for markers of kidney and liver function (e.g. AST, ALT, GGT, creatinine, etc.) and fat or protein breakdown (e.g. ketones, total protein, BUN, etc.). Present findings support contentions that higher proteins do not invoke negative alterations in any of these serum variables after 14 weeks in obese, but otherwise health populations [ 1 , 3 , 43 , 45 ]. An additional area of importance relative to public health and exercise adherence were the psychosocial assessments. In this regard, individual subscales of the SF-36 (e.g. physical functioning, bodily pain, general health, vitality, and mental health) significantly improved throughout exercise. While it could be stated that the significant increase in the bodily pain subscale was a negative response, it is an expected response considering the participants were sedentary for an extended period of time prior to the start of the study and placed in a resistance-training program, likely invoking some stiffness and delayed-onset muscle soreness. Additionally, significant increases in several subscales (e.g. appearance evaluation, appearance orientation, body area satisfaction and overweight preoccupation) of body image evaluation also improved in those individuals who were following the exercise program. In addition to improvement in several of the psychosocial variables, changes in these variables were significantly ( P < 0.05) correlated to changes in body composition (e.g. fat mass and body fat %). Considering statistical probability that one of every twenty correlations run will result in a significant finding, it is possible that significance was found merely due to chance. While not intended to be causal, these findings suggest that changes in body composition may operate in conjunction with changes in body image as a result of exercise participation. As such our investigation has many strengths and weaknesses to consider when evaluating this data against other data in this research area. Our study design could have been more complete by including a diet only control group with restricted caloric intake as this would have allowed us to more closely evaluate the impact of the exercise program in each dietary group. In this respect, a recent study has illustrated a similar weight-loss effect when a dieting only approach or a combination of exercise and diet is used if the net shift in energy expenditure is the same, however, a greater fitness benefit was reported which could have implications for cardiovascular health [ 40 ]. Additionally, while the sample size across groups varied widely, our primary interest was in evaluating the changes in different dietary regimens with the exercise program. Strengths in our study involve the use of a rather large sample over several weeks of the intervention in comparison to other related studies. Also, a strength in the present study is our examination of a commercial program that is available to women all over the world and is currently the program of choice for millions of women at over 10,000 locations across the globe. Conclusion In summary, results of this study indicate that combining a diet that restricts caloric intake in combination with a resistance-based circuit exercise program stimulates the greatest amount of weight loss and improvements in measures of body composition (e.g. waist circumference, DXA, etc.). When carbohydrate is replaced with protein while keeping fat intake at recommended levels (VLCHP and LCMP), larger decreases in waist circumference, body mass, fat mass and fat-free mass when compared to a diet that has a higher proportion of carbohydrate (HCLP) in addition to greater decreases in fasting insulin levels. As expected, regular participation in a resistance-based circuit exercise program resulted in marked losses of body mass, improvements in body composition and overall improvements in cardiovascular and musculoskeletal fitness. Participation in the exercise program allowed for weight loss without concomitant reductions in resting energy expenditure. Additionally, those participants who were identified to have a low resting energy expenditure at baseline also experienced weight loss while exercising, but being prescribed a diet higher in calories. Significant reductions in leptin levels as well as improvements in fitness, markers of health, health-related quality of life, and body image were found for all individuals who followed the exercise program. These findings suggest that replacing carbohydrate with protein can be an effective strategy to improve body composition and reduce cardiovascular disease markers while participating in a resistance-based circuit exercise program in sedentary overweight women.

Hypertrophy schemes have resulted in greater lactate responses (%) than neuronal and dynamic power schemes, suggesting possible metabolic-mediated changes in muscle growth. Factors such as age, sex, training experience and nutrition may also influence the lactate responses to resistance exercise and thereafter, muscular adaptation. Although the importance of the mechanical and hormonal stimulus to strength and power adaptation is well recognised, the contribution of the metabolic stimulus is largely unknown. Relatively few studies for example, have examined metabolic change across neuronal and dynamic power schemes, and not withstanding the fact that those mechanisms underpinning muscular adaptation, in relation to the metabolic stimulus, remain highly speculative. Inconsistent findings and methodological limitations within research (e.g. programme design, sampling period, number of samples) make interpretation further difficult. We contend that strength and power research needs to investigate those metabolic mechanisms likely to contribute to weight-training adaptation. Further research is also needed to examine the metabolic responses to different loading schemes, as well as interactions across age, sex and training status, so our understanding of how to optimise strength and power development is improved.

Journal compilation © 2008 The Physiological Society PMC Copyright notice PMCID: PMC2375570\xa0\xa0PMID: 18167367 The key components of any training programme are the volume (how much), intensity (how hard) and frequency (how often) of exercise sessions. These ‘training impulses’ determine the magnitude of adaptive responses that either enhance (fitness) or decrease (fatigue) exercise capacity ( Hawley, 2002 ). A long held view is that the training response/adaptation is directly related to the volume of exercise undertaken ( Fitts et al. 1975 ). However, there is obviously a threshold volume/duration beyond which additional stimuli do not induce further increases in functional capacity. This ‘biological ceiling’ is important because it implies that the regulatory control mechanisms signalling adaptive responses are ultimately titrated by exercise duration (Booth & Watson, 1985). Competitive athletes are all too aware of this phenomenon: many elite performers walk a tightrope between chronic intensive training and inadequate recovery that can culminate in decrements in performance and the ‘overtraining syndrome.’ Biological scientists are also mindful that training volume and adaptation can be dissociated. Over 35 years ago Dudley et al. (1982) demonstrated that rats undertaking intense workbouts for shorter time induced similar increases in the maximal activities of several oxidative enzymes (i.e. cytochrome c ) to those observed after more prolonged submaximal exercise training. One of the key tenants of exercise physiology is the principle of training specificity, which holds that training responses/adaptations are tightly coupled to the mode, frequency and duration of exercise performed ( Hawley, 2002 ). This means that the vast majority of training-induced adaptations occur only in those muscle fibres that have been recruited during the exercise regimen, with little or no adaptive changes occurring in untrained musculature. Furthermore, the principle of specificity predicts that the closer the training routine is to the requirements of the desired outcome (i.e. a specific exercise task or performance criteria), the better will be the outcome. In this issue of The Journal of Physiology , the results of study by Burgomaster et al. (2007) force us to rethink some of our long held beliefs regarding the concept of training specificity and response/adaptation, as well as providing a reminder that for certain individuals, very intense training can be a time-effective and potent stimulus for inducing many of the benefits normally associated with more prolonged, submaximal endurance-type workouts. In their recent investigation Burgomaster et al. (2007) report that 6 weeks of low-volume, high-intensity sprint training induced similar changes in selected whole-body and skeletal muscle adaptations as traditional high-volume, low-intensity endurance workouts undertaken for the same intervention period. Specifically, they show that four to six 30 s sprints separated by 4–5 min of passive recovery undertaken 3 days per week results in comparable increases in markers of skeletal muscle carbohydrate metabolism (i.e. total protein content of pyruvate dehydrogenase), lipid oxidation (i.e. maximal activity of β-3-hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase) and mitochondrial biogenesis (i.e. maximal activity of citrate synthase and total protein content of the peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α) as when subjects undertook 40–60 min of continuous submaximal cycling a day for 5 days per week. These findings are particularly impressive given that weekly training volume was ∼90% lower in the sprint-trained group (∼225 versus 2250 kJ week −1 ) resulting in a total cumulative training time of ∼1.5 versus 4.5 h per week. While the present study design did not incorporate a functional outcome measure of exercise capacity or performance, this same group ( Gibala et al. 2006 ) using identical training protocols but a shorter intervention period (14 days), have previously reported no differences in the time to complete two discrete exercise performance tasks: one a short-term, high-intensity test lasting ∼2 min and the other a longer trial of ∼55–60 min duration. Taken collectively, the results from these studies are exciting, particularly as ‘lack of time’ is a common barrier to exercise participation and adherence regardless of sex, age or health status. As with all studies, one should use caution when extrapolating the results beyond the specific conditions of the investigation. With regard to the time course of training-induced responses, it may be that high-intensity sprint training stimulates a more rapid up-regulation of selected physiological/metabolic markers than traditional low-intensity endurance training, but that over a longer period, the two training regimens elicit similar adaptations. Time course studies would resolve this question. Whether or not patients with risk factors for metabolic disease respond as positively to sprint training as young, healthy individuals also needs to be established. This is particularly relevant as continuous aerobic exercise has traditionally been recommended for fat loss because the proportion of lipid-based fuels oxidized during low-intensity exercise is greater than during high-intensity exercise. As obesity is strongly associated with a cluster of chronic metabolic disorders ( Hawley, 2004 ), any reduction in lipid oxidation or total daily energy expenditure would not be a favourable outcome for these individuals. Notwithstanding these concerns, the novel findings of Burgomaster et al. (2007) provide a platform for exercise physiologists, exercise biochemists and molecular biologists to undertake a systematic and comprehensive evaluation of the specific adaptations induced by different training strategies in both healthy and diseased populations. As previously noted ( Hawley, 2004 ) a determination of the underlying biological mechanisms that result from a wide variety of divergent exercise training protocols in association with appropriate functional outcome measures of exercise capacity is crucial in order to define the precise variations in physical activity that produce the most desired effects on targeted risk factors for disease and to aid in the development and subsequent implementation of such interventions.

It is unclear whether performing sprints spread throughout the day with much longer (≥\u20091\xa0h) recovery periods can similarly improve CRF, potentially allowing individuals to perform “sprint snacks” throughout the day to gain health benefits. Methods Healthy, young, inactive adults (~\u200922 years, peak oxygen uptake [VO 2 peak]\u2009~\u200935\xa0ml\xa0kg −\u20091 min −\u20091 ) were randomly assigned to one of two groups and performed 18 training sessions over 6 wks. Sprint snacks (SS) involved 3\u2009×\u200920-s ‘all out’ cycling bouts separated by 1–4-h rest ( n =\u200912, 7 females). Traditional SIT involved 3\u2009×\u200920-s bouts interspersed with 3-min rest within a 10-min training session ( n =\u200916, 7 females). The primary outcome was CRF determined by a V O 2 peak test conducted before and after training. Secondary outcomes included a 150\xa0kJ cycling time trial and exercise enjoyment. Results Absolute V O 2 peak increased by ~\u20096% after SIT and ~\u20094% for SS (main effect of time P =\u20090.002) with no difference between groups (group × time interaction, P =\u20090.52). 150\xa0kJ time trial performance improved by ~\u200913% in SIT and ~\u20099% in SS (main effect of time, P <\u20090.001) with no difference between groups (group × time interaction, P =\u20090.36). Conclusion CRF was similarly increased by a protocol involving sprint snacks spread throughout the day and a traditional SIT protocol in which bouts were separated by short recovery periods within a single training session.

Free Abstract Most exercise programs for conditioning and rehabilitation are oriented to strength development, aerobic (cardiovascular) fitness, or a combination of the 2. Because the 2 types of exercise are located at the opposite extremes of a muscular power continuum, the design of a program must be highly specific with regard to the exercise to be undertaken, as well as the intensity, duration, and frequency, in order to attain optimal results. Strength exercise programs involve weight training or the use of high-resistance machines with exercise that is limited to a few repetitions (generally less than 20) before exhaustion. Aerobic exercise involves exercise performed for extended periods (e.g., 10–40 minutes) with large muscle activity involving hundreds of consecutive repetitions that challenge the delivery of oxygen to the active muscles. The chronic physiological adaptations and the variables in program design are highly specific to the type of exercise performed. © 2007 National Strength and Conditioning Association'}"

Jones 1 & Helen Carter 2 38k Accesses 227 Altmetric 47 Mentions Explore all metrics Abstract Endurance exercise training results in profound adaptations of the cardiorespiratory and neuromuscular systems that enhance the delivery of oxygen from the atmosphere to the mitochondria and enable a tighter regulation of muscle metabolism. These adaptations effect an improvement in endurance performance that is manifest as a rightward shift in the ‘velocity-time curve’. This shift enables athletes to exercise for longer at a given absolute exercise intensity, or to exercise at a higher exercise intensity for a given duration. There are 4 key parameters of aerobic fitness that affect the nature of the velocity-time curve that can be measured in the human athlete. These are the maximal oxygen uptake (V̇O 2max ), exercise economy, the lactate/ventilatory threshold and oxygen uptake kinetics. Other parameters that may help determine endurance performance, and that are related to the other 4 parameters, are the velocity at V̇O 2max (V-V̇O 2max ) and the maximal lactate steady state or critical power. This review considers the effect of endurance training on the key parameters of aerobic (endurance) fitness and attempts to relate these changes to the adaptations seen in the body’s physiological systems with training. The importance of improvements in the aerobic fitness parameters to the enhancement of endurance performance is highlighted, as are the training methods that may be considered optimal for facilitating such improvements.

Whole-body aerobic resistance training circuit improves aerobic fitness and muscle strength in sedentary young females. J Strength Cond Res 29(6): 1592–1600, 2015—This study aimed to determine whether a time-effective whole-body aerobic resistance training circuit using only body weight exercises is as effective in improving aerobic and anaerobic fitness, as well as muscular strength and endurance as a traditional concurrent style training combining resistance and endurance training. Thirty-four sedentary females (20.9 ± 3.2 years; 167.6 ± 6.4 cm; 65.0 ± 15.2 kg) were assigned to either: (a) a combined resistance and aerobic exercise group (COMBINED; n = 17) or (b) a circuit-based whole-body aerobic resistance training circuit group (CIRCUIT; n = 17). Training was 3 days per week for 5 weeks. Pre- and post-training measures included a V[Combining Dot Above]O 2 peak test, anaerobic Wingate cycling test, and muscular strength and endurance tests. After training, V[Combining Dot Above]O 2 peak improved with CIRCUIT by 11% ( p = 0.015), with no change for COMBINED ( p = 0.375). Both relative peak power output and relative average power output improved with CIRCUIT by 5% ( p = 0.027) and 3.2% ( p = 0.006), respectively, and with COMBINED by 5.3% ( p = 0.025) and 5.1% ( p = 0.003). Chest and hamstrings 1 repetition maximum (1RM) improved with CIRCUIT by 20.6% ( p = 0.011) and 8.3% ( p = 0.022) and with COMBINED by 35.6% ( p < 0.001) and 10.2% ( p = 0.004), respectively. Only the COMBINED group improved back (11.7%; p = 0.017) and quadriceps (9.6%; p = 0.006) 1RM. The COMBINED group performed more repetitions at 60% of their pretraining 1RM for back (10.0%; p = 0.006) and hamstring (23.3%; p = 0.056) vs. CIRCUIT. Our results suggest that a circuit-based whole-body aerobic resistance training program can elicit a greater cardiorespiratory response and similar muscular strength gains with less time commitment compared with a traditional resistance training program combined with aerobic exercise. Introduction Regular exercise is well known to improve health and reduce a number of risk factors for chronic disease ( 7 ). Typically, participation in exercise follows a traditional approach of separate resistance and aerobic exercises. This combination of exercise training modalities improves body composition and cardiovascular fitness in both sedentary and overweight populations ( 20,21,34,36 ). Despite the health benefits, approximately 47% of Canadian adults fail to participate in physical activity more than 1 day a week and 85% do not meet Canada's new physical activity recommendations ( 12 ). Potential reasons for this lack of participation in physical activity include barriers such as accessibility to gym equipment or a fitness facility or lack of time ( 18,23 ). Furthermore, many people view physical activity itself as time consuming, in addition to other time-consuming factors such as travel time to a fitness facility. These barriers deter people from performing physical activity, preventing positive benefits ( 10,22 ). Although not time effective, alternative forms of exercise training have been used to improve fitness such as circuit training. Typical circuit training involves the use of resistance training exercise carried out with external loads performed in succession with little rest periods between exercises ( 31 ). This style of training however does not address the time-component, as exercise sessions are similar to combined resistance and aerobic training sessions. Although high-intensity interval training has gained in popularity recently due to its time-efficient and effective training sessions for improving aerobic/anaerobic fitness and health ( 15,24,25 ), these time-efficient but intense workouts include supramaximal efforts using running and cycling as modes of exercise. Whether using repeated body weight resistance training exercises with little to no rest periods over a similarly time-efficient workout would improve both cardiovascular fitness and muscular strength/endurance is not well understood. Recently, it was demonstrated that single-set whole-body aerobic resistance training (8 sets of 20-second intervals with 10-second rest between sets over 4 weeks; Tabata protocol) using body weight exercises with light external loads improved cardiovascular fitness in recreationally active females similar to traditional endurance training, but only the interval group improved muscular endurance ( 27 ). This high-intensity exercise format can be tailored to many exercise protocols and can be performed without fitness equipment by performing specific body weight exercises (i.e., squats, lunges, and burpees) in succession with only small breaks between exercises or between sets of exercises. Nonetheless, the previous study did not compare the interval workout to a combination of resistance and aerobic training. Therefore, whether whole-body aerobic resistance training can improve aerobic/anaerobic fitness and muscle strength/endurance similar to traditional resistance training combined with aerobic training is currently unknown. The purpose of this study was to determine whether a time-effective whole-body aerobic resistance training circuit is as effective as traditional resistance training combined with aerobic exercise in improving aerobic and anaerobic fitness, as well as muscular strength and endurance in young sedentary females. Methods Experimental Approach to the Problem Participants completed 5 weeks of training (3 times per week). Pre- and post-training measures included a V[Combining Dot Above]O 2 peak test, 30-seccond anaerobic Wingate cycle test, and muscular strength/endurance tests for the chest, back, quadriceps, and hamstrings muscles. Pretraining testing was completed in 2 sessions over 1 week separated by at least 48 hours. After pretesting, participants were assigned to one of the 2 groups: (a) whole-body aerobic resistance training circuit group (CIRCUIT) or (b) traditional resistance training combined with aerobic exercise (COMBINED) based on their pretraining V[Combining Dot Above]O 2 peak and muscular strength. Posttraining testing began 72 hours after the final training session to eliminate any acute exercise effects and was completed in 2 sessions separated by at least 48 hours identical to pretesting. Subjects Thirty-four healthy sedentary females ( n = 34; 20.9 ± 3.2 years; age range was 18–29 years; 167.9 ± 6.5 cm; 68.0 ± 15.2 kg; mean ± SD ) volunteered to participate in this study. All participants were healthy as assessed by the PAR-Q health questionnaire ( 38 ) and all were deemed sedentary based on their self-reported habitual physical activity, which consisted of ≤2 sessions per week of structured exercise for ≤30 minutes per session according to both the American College of Sports Medicine ( 13 ) and the Canadian Society for Exercise Physiology ( 39 ). Participants were instructed to maintain their regular dietary habits for the duration of the study. Before any participation, the experimental procedures were explained fully to each participant and all provided written informed consent. The University of Lethbridge Human Subjects Research Committee approved this study. Familiarization Each participant completed a laboratory familiarization session to introduce all testing procedures and ensure that any learning effect was minimal for baseline measures. Participants also performed the exercises that they would be performing during training to ensure they learned proper form. Participants performed repetitions of each exercise with a light amount of weight (5–7.5 kg) for the resistance exercises or with their own body mass for the circuit exercises. At the end of this session all participants were comfortable performing each exercise with proper form and cadence. Pretraining Testing All participants were instructed to refrain from consuming alcohol or caffeine within 24 hours of pretesting and to refrain from any physical activity in that time frame. Height and body mass were measured using a physician beam scale (Healthometer; Sunbeam Products, Florida, USA). Participants completed: (a) a cycling V[Combining Dot Above]O 2 peak test to measure cardiorespiratory fitness, (b) a 30-second Wingate cycle tests, (c) predicted 1 repetition maximum (1RM) testing, and (d) muscular endurance testing. V[Combining Dot Above]O 2 peak and the Wingate were completed in the same session with V[Combining Dot Above]O 2 peak performed first followed by the Wingate test after 15-minute recovery period. Muscular strength and endurance were completed in a separate session, with strength completed first and endurance completed after a 15-minute recovery period. We determined through pilot testing on 6 sedentary individuals who performing the 30-second Wingate tests after the V[Combining Dot Above]O 2 peak test first and 15 minutes of rest resulted in no differences in relative peak power output, relative average power output, relative minimum power output, or fatigue index (data not shown). Participants were required to wait at least 48 hours between pretesting sessions. V[Combining Dot Above]O 2 peak cycle ergometer test—an incremental test to exhaustion on a mechanically cycle ergometer (model 874-E; Monark Exercise, Stockholm, Sweden) was used to determine V[Combining Dot Above]O 2 peak using an online breath-by-breath gas collection system (Quark CPET; Cosmed, Chicago, IL, USA). Before testing, gas analyzers were calibrated using a 3-L syringe and compressed gas of a known concentration. After a 5-minute warm-up at resistance of 1 kg and 70 rpm (∼70 W), an additional 0.5-kg resistance was added (∼35 W) every 2 minutes until 70 rpm could no longer be maintained or volitional fatigue. Verbal encouragement was provided throughout the test. Attainment of V[Combining Dot Above]O 2 peak was verified by a respiratory exchange ratio value greater than 1.1 or by achieving age-predicted HR max (220-age). We did not consistently observe a plateau in V[Combining Dot Above]O 2 during the incremental protocol. Wingate anaerobic cycle test—a 30-second Wingate anaerobic cycle test ( 5 ) using a mechanically braked cycle ergometer (model 874-E; Monark Exercise) against a resistance equivalent to 7.5% of their body mass was used to determine anaerobic power output. Instructions to begin pedaling as fast as possible against the inertial resistance of the ergometer were given and the appropriate load was applied instantaneously (within 3 seconds). Verbal encouragement was provided for the remainder of the 30-second test. Peak power (highest output over any 5 seconds), average power (over the entire effort), and minimum power (lowest output) were determined using an online data-acquisition system (SMI power version 5.2.8; SMI optosensor, St. Cloud, MN, USA). Fatigue index (%) was also calculated using the following formula: Predicted 1RM testing—for the purposes of this study, 1RM was defined as the maximum weight a participant could lift in a given exercise with good form through the full range of motion with no help. Participants performed a predicted 1RM ( 30 ) to measure muscular strength for chest (vertical bench), back (wide-grip lat pulldown), quadriceps (leg extension), and hamstrings (leg curl) muscles due to lack of familiarity with exercise techniques. All exercises were performed using resistance exercise machines (Life Fitness Strength, Rosemont, IL, USA). Briefly, participants warmed up with 5 minutes of light aerobic exercise followed by the exercises at a low resistance (weight they could lift comfortably for 12–15 repetitions). Predicted 1RM testing then initiated with participants lifting 2 different sets of submaximal loads ( 8 ). Participants lifted 2 sets, 1 with 3–5 repetitions to fatigue, and the other with 5–10 repetitions to fatigue. The weights lifted in the 3–5 repetition set (SM 1 ) and the 5–10 repetition set (SM 2 ) as well as the number of repetitions performed in each set (REP 1 and REP 2 ) were used in the following formula was used to predict 1RM strength ( 8 ): Muscular endurance—muscle endurance was defined as the maximal number of repetitions that could be lifted at 60% of their 1RM weight with full range of motion and no help for each muscle tested for strength. Posttesting Posttesting was identical to baseline testing with at least 48 hours between testing sessions, and started 72 hours after the final training session and was completed within 10 days of the final training session. Testing occurred at the same time of day as the pretraining measures. Training Interventions The first training session took place at least 48 hours after the last pretraining testing session. Training occurred 3 times per week (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday) for a duration of 5 weeks (15 sessions in total). All training sessions were supervised. At the beginning of each week, participants were provided with their weekly training program and met with study investigators to go through the training protocol and ensure proper technique for their specific exercises. Before each exercise session, participants performed a 10-minute warm-up of light aerobic exercise. Whole-Body Aerobic Resistance Training Circuit Group There were 5 different exercise routines ( Table 1 ) completed in the circuit training group. Each exercise routine was completed for 1 week (3 sessions). Participants completed as many cycles of the routine as possible in 30 minutes. Specified repetitions of the specific exercise were completed before moving onto the next exercise. Exercises were chosen for simplicity with no need for equipment and to mimic similar muscle groups targeted in the COMBINED group. Participants were encouraged to take as little rest as possible in these break periods to ensure a high-intensity workout. The exercise programs were modified from week to week to try and maintain interest on behalf of the participants. Table 1: Exercise protocol for the whole-body aerobic resistance training circuit group (CIRCUIT).* Traditional Resistance Training Combined With Aerobic Exercise Group There were also 5 different exercise routines ( Table 2 ) completed in the traditional training group. Each routine was performed for 1 week (3 sessions). These training sessions had participants perform resistance training for 2–3 sets at ∼50–70% 1RM for each exercise with 12–15 repetitions. All exercises were performed on machines (Life Fitness Strength) with 1-minute rest periods between each set. After completing the resistance training portion, participants completed 15 minutes of aerobic exercise at 80% of age-predicted maximal heart rate. This aerobic exercise was performed on an elliptical, cycle ergometer, or treadmill. Overall, training session duration was 45 minutes with 30 minutes of resistance exercise followed by 15 minutes of aerobic exercise. Workout logs were used to record sets and repetitions allowing supervisors to make sure repetition ranges were adhered to. Weights were increased when participants lifted above 15 repetitions and lowered if they completed less than 12. Similarly to the CIRCUIT group, adjustments were made in the exercise programs each week to try maintaining interest on behalf of the participants. Table 2: Exercise protocol for the traditional resistance training group (COMBINED).* Statistical Analyses Statistical analyses were performed using Sigma Stat for Windows (version 3.5). After testing for normality and variance homogeneity, 2-way (treatment × time) repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to test significance among groups pre- and post-training, with Tukey's post hoc testing, where necessary. For muscular endurance, a 1-way ANOVA was also performed to compare number of repetitions between groups at each time point. The significance level was set at p ≤ 0.05. All data are presented as mean ± SD . Results There were no significant differences between groups in any variable pretesting. Both groups were similar in age, height, and body mass pretraining (CIRCUIT: 21.7 ± 2.9 years; 168.4 ± 6.3 cm; 68.5 ± 12.2 kg; COMBINED: 20.0 ± 3.4 years; 166.8 ± 6.7 cm; 67.4 ± 18.0 kg). There were no differences in body mass between groups ( p = 0.926) or from pre- to post-training ( p = 0.126) or in height between groups ( p = 0.786) or from pre- to post-training ( p = 0.996). Of the 34 participants recruited, 32 completed the training. Two participants withdrew from the study, 1 in each group (1 due to injury and the other due to sickness). Overall, attendance across both training groups was 93% with missed sessions due to other commitments (school, work) or illness. Aerobic Fitness (VO 2 peak) There was a significant interaction with time (training group vs. time; p = 0.018). V[Combining Dot Above]O 2 peak increased 11% (3.6 ml·kg −1 ·min −1 ; p = 0.015) in the CIRCUIT group (Figure 1). There was no change in the COMBINED group ( p = 0.375). Figure 1: V[Combining Dot Above]O 2 peak (ml·kg −1 ·min −1 ) before and after 5 weeks of training. * p ≤ 0.05. Anaerobic Fitness (Wingate Cycle Test) There was no significant interaction with time for relative peak power output (training group vs. time; p = 0.986), but there was a main effect of time ( p = 0.004) where both CIRCUIT (5.0%; p = 0.027) and COMBINED (5.3%; p = 0.025) improved (Figure 2A). There was no interaction with time for relative average power output ( p = 0.826), but there was a main effect of time ( p < 0.001) where both CIRCUIT (3.2%; p = 0.006) and COMBINED (5.1%; p = 0.003) improved (Figure 2B). There was no interaction with time for relative minimum power output ( p = 0.611), but there was a main effect of time on relative minimum power output ( p = 0.012) where only CIRCUIT (7.5%; p = 0.031) improved with training (COMBINED; p = 0.135; Figure 2C). There was no interaction with time ( p = 0.761), no main effects for training ( p = 0.930), or for time ( p = 0.726) with fatigue index (Figure 2D).

Muscular Strength There was no significant interaction with time for chest strength (training group vs. time; p = 0.214), but there was a main effect of time ( p < 0.001) where both CIRCUIT (20.6%; p = 0.011) and COMBINED (35.6%; p < 0.001) improved (Figure 3A). There was no interaction with time for back strength ( p = 0.678), but there was a main effect of time ( p = 0.004) where COMBINED improved (11.7%; p = 0.017) but CIRCUIT did not ( p = 0.137; Figure 3B). There was no interaction with time for quadriceps strength ( p = 0.308), but there was a main effect of time ( p = 0.003) where only COMBINED (9.6%; p = 0.006) improved with training (CIRCUIT; p = 0.137; Figure 3C). There was no interaction with time for hamstrings strength ( p = 0.581), but there was a main effect for time ( p < 0.001) where both CIRCUIT (8.3%; p = 0.022) and COMBINED (10.2%; 0.004) improved (Figure 3D). Figure 3: Maximum predicted 1RM strength for the chest (A), back (B), quadriceps (C), and hamstrings (D) before and after 5 weeks of training. * p ≤ 0.05. 1RM = 1 repetition maximum. Muscular Endurance There was no significant interaction with time for chest endurance (training group vs. time; p = 0.367), and there were no main effects for group ( p = 0.766) or time ( p = 0.668; Table 3 ). There was no significant interaction with time for back endurance (training group vs. time; p = 0.670), but there was a main effect for time ( p = 0.022) where both groups performed fewer repetitions at their current 60% 1RM weight ( p < 0.047; Table 3 ). There was no significant interaction for quadriceps endurance ( p = 0.911) and no main effect for group ( p = 0.271) or time ( p = 0.233; Table 3 ). There was no significant interaction with time for hamstrings endurance (training group vs. time; p = 0.330), but there was a main effect for time ( p = 0.030) where the CIRCUIT group performed less repetitions posttraining ( p = 0.046), whereas there was no difference compared with pretraining in the COMBINED group ( p = 0.676; Table 3 ). However, comparing the number of repetitions lifted pretesting compared with posttesting revealed that the COMBINED group lifted more repetitions of their current 60% 1RM weight posttesting for the back ( p = 0.006) and hamstrings ( p = 0.005) vs. the CIRCUIT group ( Table 3 ). Table 3: Muscular endurance.*† Discussion The purpose of this investigation was to compare the effect of a whole-body aerobic resistance training circuit (CIRCUIT) using only body weight exercises to a traditional resistance training combined with aerobic exercise program (COMBINED) on aerobic and anaerobic fitness, as well as muscular strength and endurance in young sedentary females. The CIRCUIT program was time efficient compared with the COMBINED program as it was only 2/3 the time. The main findings are (a) the body weight CIRCUIT program increased aerobic fitness, whereas the COMBINED training did not; (b) both training programs improved anaerobic fitness (relative peak power output and relative average power output), although only the CIRCUIT group increased relative minimum power output; and (c) both groups improved muscular strength for the chest and hamstring muscles, whereas only the COMBINED improved back and quadriceps strength. Neither group improved muscular endurance and actually performed less repetitions posttraining for back and hamstrings, although the COMBINED group performed more repetitions compared with the CIRCUIT group. An 11% increase in cardiorespiratory fitness after 5 weeks of body weight CIRCUIT training in sedentary females provides evidence for the time-effectiveness of a whole-body aerobic resistance training program using only body weight exercises in sedentary females. Our participants performed primarily resistance training exercises (i.e., squats, lunges, push-ups, etc.) with little to no rest between exercises and sets and still improved cardiorespiratory fitness, similar to previous research on circuit-based training ( 6,14,27,28,37 ). It should be noted that while our participants did not complete a large amount of low-intensity cardiovascular exercise (i.e., traditional endurance exercise), they did complete small amounts at supramaximal intensity and this type of training has consistently demonstrated increases in cardiovascular measures ( 16,25 ). In contrast, the COMBINED training group did not undergo an increase in V[Combining Dot Above]O 2 peak, which is perhaps not surprising. Fifteen minutes of aerobic exercise training at 80% maximum heart rate, 3 times per week for 5 weeks, may be insufficient to evoke positive adaptations in cardiorespiratory fitness, even in previously sedentary females. Although a previous study has demonstrated that combined aerobic and resistance training can impair cardiorespiratory adaptations ( 17 ), others using both lower repetition sets with higher loads ( 29 ) as well as a similar repetition and weight range to this study ( 34 ) found no impairment on cardiorespiratory adaptations. Thus, the lack of an aerobic adaptation in our current study is likely due to an insufficient training stimulus in the COMBINED group. In terms of anaerobic fitness, both training programs resulted in increases in relative peak power output and relative average power output during a 30-second Wingate cycle test, although only the CIRCUIT group improved relative minimum power output. Similar increases in anaerobic power with circuit-based training and traditional resistance training have been previously demonstrated ( 11 ). The increases in leg strength in the COMBINED group (see below) likely played a role in the increase in anaerobic performance ( 1,32 ). While this was also a possibility in the CIRCUIT group, other metabolic adaptations (increases in glycolytic enzymes, improved muscle buffering capacity, and ionic regulation) resulting from training under constant fatigue likely factored in Ref. 31 . Both CIRCUIT ( 26,40 ) and COMBINED ( 2 ) groups increased muscle strength in the chest and hamstrings, although only the COMBINED group increased back and quadriceps strength. No change in strength for the back could perhaps be expected in the CIRCUIT group as they only used body mass–resisted exercise with no equipment, and therefore, no exercises targeted the back directly. This limitation of no specific back exercises in the CIRCUIT group and the increase in back strength in the COMBINED group highlights the necessity to target-specific muscle groups (i.e., with extra equipment) to train the back musculature. Further research should examine how to increase back strength in a whole-body aerobic style resistance training exercise routine with minimal equipment. The lack of change in quadriceps strength is surprising due to the heavy focus on squats and lunges. Perhaps the quadriceps need to be loaded with additional weight (greater than body mass alone) to generate increases in strength as they are a major load bearing and supporting muscle group during normal gait ( 3,35 ). However, the possibility of a type II error cannot be overlooked as CIRCUIT training did result in nonsignificant 8.3% increase in quadriceps strength. The similar increases in chest and hamstring strength between the CIRCUIT and COMBINED groups is impressive considering the COMBINED group trained using the pre- and post-testing exercises, therefore should have had greater test-specific learning, coordination, and neuromuscular recruitment ( 33 ). Moreover, the CIRCUIT group increases in muscular strength occurred along with the aforementioned increases in aerobic fitness, which is in contrast to the COMBINED group and previous research on concurrent training ( 4,19 ). In this study, we used the participants current 60% 1RM weight to test muscular endurance, which resulted in both groups performing less repetitions posttraining. Although the COMBINED group lifted a significantly higher number of repetitions posttraining compared with the CIRCUIT group, they still had a reduced muscle endurance overall. Perhaps, test-specific learning, coordination, and neuromuscular recruitment may explain this improved muscle endurance posttraining compared with the CIRCUIT group but not pretraining data. This is in contrast to previous research using a whole-body aerobic resistance interval training program (Tabata protocol) in recreationally active females ( 27 ). The main difference could be due to the current use of 60% of their current 1RM, whereas McRae et al. used a specific percentage of body mass. Moreover, high-repetition low-weight training has also demonstrated significant increases in muscular endurance ( 9 ). Our results are limited to the sedentary female population, and investigations into the effectiveness of aerobic whole-body resistance circuit training on measures of cardiorespiratory and muscle power are warranted in the male population. In an effort to limit our training to the specified time periods, the variety and modality of exercise was constrained along with the number of repetitions that could be performed. This limitation may have influenced the outcome, such as the regional increases in strength, but demonstrated that a time-constrained training program is effective. Considerations toward endurance measures relative to body weight or absolute muscular endurance could be addressed in the future. Practical Applications A 5-week aerobic whole-body resistance circuit training of 30 minutes per session is sufficient for improvements in cardiorespiratory power, anaerobic power output, and muscle strength in sedentary females. Similar adaptations in anaerobic power output and muscle strength were observed in traditional concurrent resistance and endurance training of 45 minutes per session without the added benefits of increased cardiorespiratory power. Aerobic whole-body resistance circuit training is an effective time-efficient method of improving health determinants in sedentary females. Acknowledgments T. R. Myers and M. G.

Similar to muscles, the executive functions become fatigued following intensive use (e.g. stressful situations, when tired or busy, and when regulating behaviour such as quitting smoking). Therefore, an individual may be more susceptible to engaging in unhealthy behaviours when their executive functions are depleted. In the present study we investigate associations between the executive functions, snack food consumption, and sedentary behaviour in real time. We hypothesise that individuals may be more susceptible to unhealthy snacking and sedentary behaviours during periods when their executive functions are depleted. We test this hypothesis using real-time objective within-person measurements. Methods/Design A sample of approximately 50 Scottish adults from varied socio-economic, working, and cultural backgrounds will participate in the three phases of the SNAcking, Physical activity, Self-regulation, and Heart rate Over Time (SNAPSHOT) study. Phase one will require participants to complete home-based questionnaires concerned with diet, eating behaviour, and physical activity (≈1.5 hours to complete). Phase two will constitute a 2-3 hour psychological laboratory testing session during which trait-level executive function, general intelligence, and diet and physical activity intentions, past behaviour, and automaticity will be measured. The final phase will involve a 7-day ambulatory protocol during which objective repeated assessments of executive function, snacking behaviour, physical activity, mood, heart rate, perceived energy level, current context and location will be measured during participants’ daily routines. Multi-level regression analysis, accounting for observations nested within participants, will be used to investigate associations between fluctuations in the executive functions and health behaviours. Discussion Data from the SNAPSHOT study will provide ecologically valid information to help better understand the temporal associations between self-regulatory resources (executive functions) and deleterious health behaviours such as snacking and sedentary behaviour. If we can identify particular periods of the day or locations where self-regulatory resources become depleted and produce suboptimal health behaviour, then interventions can be designed and targeted accordingly.

This means that individuals who intend to improve or maintain their health must continually choose between engaging in behaviours that are effort free and immediately rewarding (e.g. going for a drive-through meal on the way home from work), and those that are ultimately healthy but require effortful behavioural regulation (e.g. walking or cycling home from work before preparing a freshly-cooked meal). The cognitive processes responsible for effortful behavioural regulation are known as the executive functions [ 2 ]. These are multiple related but distinct cognitive processes involved in the planning, initiation, sequencing, and monitoring of complex goal-directed behaviour [ 3 ]. Deficits in these executive functions are associated with elevated body mass index and obesity in children and adults [ 4 – 7 ], increased consumption of fatty foods [ 8 , 9 ], a reduced ability to adhere to stated dietary intentions [ 10 , 11 ], and a reduced ability to resist indulging in energy-dense foods [ 12 ]. Most research linking executive function to dietary behaviour has focused on stable, trait-level differences in executive function between people. However, executive processing is resource intensive, and as a consequence, is vulnerable to transient within-person fluctuations in efficiency. In one sense, the executive functions operate like a muscle: expending regulatory energy depletes available cognitive resources and leaves individuals less able to exert further regulatory control until resources have been replenished [ 13 , 14 ]. This has been demonstrated experimentally in a laboratory setting, where it has been shown that participants have reduced capacity to regulate consumption of unhealthy foods following tasks designed to deplete self-control resource [ 15 , 16 ]. Situations under which executive resources may become depleted include times of stress, tiredness, when extremely busy (trying to do multiple things at once), and when trying to regulate behaviours (e.g. when quitting smoking, trying not to get angry/upset etc.). Multiple factors that replenish resources and improve subsequent attempts at behavioural regulation have been identified, most notably rest/sleep [ 17 ] and increased blood glucose through consumption of high glucose foods [ 18 ]. This resource-dependent variability in the capacity to regulate behavior has three interesting implications for dietary research: 1) Individuals may be more likely to succumb to dietary temptation at moments when their regulatory resources are temporarily depleted. This has been experimentally demonstrated in the laboratory setting [ 16 ]. 2) These regulatory failures may be more likely to occur in individuals with low trait levels of executive function (as these individuals would be expected to have lower initial levels of cognitive resource). This has also been demonstrated in the laboratory setting [ 10 ]. 3) When resources are depleted, individuals may be more likely to consume high energy foods and reduce energy expenditure in an attempt to conserve/replenish their dwindling cognitive reserves. This hypothesis, to our knowledge, remains untested. In each case, the net result is the same; temporary reductions in executive functioning may lead to increased energy intake and decreased energy expenditure. Intriguingly, this may produce a paradoxical situation for individuals trying to eat less/exercise more, as their actions may serve to reduce the very resources they need to continue to regulate their behaviour, making healthy eating and physical activity more difficult, but even more important. Aims The SNAPSHOT study aims to examine the relationship between dietary intake (specifically snack food consumption), energy expenditure, and executive function in real time and outwith the laboratory using Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA). If, as hypothesised, temporary depletion of executive resources renders people less able to effortfully regulate their behaviour, and encourages increases in energy intake, we would expect to find that episodes of energy dense snack consumption and sedentary behaviour are immediately preceded by drops in executive efficiency. In order to understand the determinants of any such drops in executive efficiency, variation in environmental, social and contextual factors will be recorded. As such, we will be able to identify factors which, if altered, may help to provide an environment that is supportive rather than disruptive to an individual’s attempts to effortfully regulate their behaviour. SNAPSHOT will assess snack food consumption in particular because, although snacks are theoretically supplementary to the main diet, they represent a major source of caloric intake [ 19 ]. Snack foods are typically highly palatable and because they are usually energy-dense (i.e. they contain comparatively more calories per portion size than other foods) they are easy to over consume, leading to a higher caloric intake and ultimately weight gain [ 20 , 21 ]. Regarding the physical activity component of the present study, it has been shown that sedentary behaviour is particularly detrimental to health [ 22 ], because not only is it associated with the absence of physical activity, it is also frequently associated with snacking; particularly so in the case of television viewing [ 23 – 25 ]. Findings from the SNAPSHOT study will help to address the following specific research questions: 1) Do individuals with low trait levels of executive function engage in more high-calorie snacking and sedentary behavior than others? 2) Are episodes of high calorie snacking and sedentary behaviour immediately preceded by state reductions in executive function efficiency? a) Is any such effect moderated by higher levels of trait executive function (i.e. do higher initial cognitive reserves protect against depletion)? 3) Are reductions in executive function efficiency associated with particular contextual/environmental factors? 4) Are episodes of high calorie snacking and sedentary behavior associated with particular contextual/environmental factors independently of executive functioning? 5) Is energy dense snacking related to reductions in physical activity in real time (i.e. do individuals appear to simultaneously increase intake and decrease expenditure)? Methods/Design Ethical approval Ethical approval for all procedures was granted by the College of Life Science and Medicine Ethical Review Board at the University of Aberdeen (CERB/2012/8/761), and all procedures adhere to the Declaration of Helsinki. All participants will provide written informed consent prior to study participation. Target population We aim to recruit adults from a wide variety of backgrounds in terms of occupation, social status, age, and weight. Potential participants will be excluded if they 1) are taking medication that may alter natural heart rhythms (as heart rate measures will be taken), 2) are not fluent in English, 3) are younger than 18 years, 4) have auditory problems that may prevent them hearing a reminder alarm used with one of the measurement instruments, and 5) have motor problems that may prevent them making speeded button presses during some of the psychological tests. Recruitment strategy Recruitment started in February 2013 and will continue simultaneously with data collection through 2014 until a sample of around 50 participants has been achieved. Participants will be recruited using various methods including 1) study posters and flyers around University of Aberdeen buildings and local businesses, 2) distribution of a press-release to local and national media giving details of the study, and 3) creation of a study website ( http://www.abdn.ac.uk/snapshot/ ) in order to attract potential participants and to provide existing participants with relevant study information. Recruitment materials will contain study team contact details so that interested individuals can request a study information sheet providing additional details on the study protocol and inclusion and exclusion criteria. Protocol The SNAPSHOT study will consist of three phases. The first of these is a home-based phase where participants will be sent three questionnaires about diet and physical activity by post. These questionnaires will take approximately 1.5 hours to complete, and will be returned to the research team using a pre-paid envelope. The second phase will involve a 2-3 hour laboratory visit during which participants complete several written and computerised psychological tests, primarily related to the executive functions. Participants will be invited to take part in phase-2 as soon as is practicably possible following receipt of their completed phase-1 questionnaires, preferably within one or two weeks. Phase three will involve a 7-day real-time measurement period, during which participants will wear an accelerometer, GPS tracker, heart rate monitor, and electronic diary during waking hours in order to establish levels of snack consumption, fruit and vegetable consumption (as a comparator to unhealthy snacking), executive function, mood, physical activity, sedentary behaviour, environmental location, and heart rate. Phase three will commence immediately on completion of the phase two laboratory testing session (i.e. participants will leave the laboratory wearing the various measurement devices), regardless of the day of the week and will run for 7 days. A member of the research team will arrange to collect the measurement equipment from the participant at the end of the 7 days of monitoring, and participants will be offered the opportunity to receive a summary of data from each of the measurement devices and an overview of the aims of the project. A nominal award of £20 vouchers for a well known food and clothes retailer will be provided to participants on completion of the study. This is in recognition of the time and effort required from participants. Measures Multiple known determinants of diet and physical activity (e.g. intentions, eating style, past behaviour, etc) will be assessed in addition to the core executive function measures so that (a) the target behaviours of the sample can be adequately described, (b) known predictors can be controlled for in data analyses, and (c) it is possible to test whether executive function moderates the effect of known predictors (e.g. as has been shown in the relationship between dietary intentions and behaviour; Allan et al. 2011 [ 10 ]). Home-based phase Eating style Eating style will be assessed using the 33 item Dutch Eating Behaviour Questionnaire [ 26 ]. The DEBQ comprises three subscales measuring; 1) emotional eating, defined as the tendency to eat in response to emotional states such as anxiety or anger, 2) external eating, defined as the tendency to eat in response to external food cues such as the sight or smell of food, and 3) restrained eating, defined as the tendency to overeat following a period of dietary restraint. Responses are made using a 5-point Likert scale. The reliability and validity of the DEBQ has been established [ 27 ], and recent research has linked high scores on the external eating subscale to the propensity to eat energy dense snacks during periods of sedentary behaviour [ 28 ]. The DEBQ takes 3-4 minutes to complete. Typical dietary intake Typical dietary intake will be measured using the Scottish Collaborative Group Food Frequency Questionnaire version 6.6. The SCG-FFQ consists of 170 foods and drinks grouped into 19 categories, plus an additional three sections on consumption of foods and drinks not listed in the main questionnaire, dietary supplements, and additional information. Common portion sizes for each food/drink are given (e.g. Bread: 1 medium slice) and participants indicate how many portions of each food they eat a day and how often this consumption occurs over the course of a week. All questions are asked with reference to typical diet over the preceding 2-3 months. Photographs illustrating standard portion sizes are given on the front page of the questionnaire. The resultant data will be used to obtain estimates of each participant’s total caloric intake and consumption of important food groups. The SCG-FFQ has been validated in both young and old adults against 4-day weighed intakes [ 29 , 30 ] and takes 20-30 minutes to complete. Self-reported physical activity Self-reported physical activity levels will be assessed using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). The IPAQ is a 27-item questionnaire used to generate data on physical activity over the last 7 days. Activity data are collected for the following domains: work, house and garden work, travel from place to place, and spare time (recreation, exercise, or sport). For each domain, participants are questioned about the number of days (frequency) and hours and minutes per day (volume) that they spend at different activity intensities (i.e. vigorous and moderate). Additionally, the final two items ask about hours and minutes spent per day sitting on weekdays and weekend days (i.e. sedentary behaviour). The IPAQ has acceptable validity when assessing levels and patterns of activity in healthy adults and correlates well with objective accelerometer-based measures of total activity [ 31 ]. The IPAQ takes approximately 5 minutes to complete. Laboratory phase Participants will be invited to attend the laboratory phase of the study in a university campus building for a weekday morning or afternoon slot. If the proposed time does not suit the participant, due to work commitments for example, an evening or weekend slot will be offered. Demographics Participants will be required to attend the laboratory session in a non-fasted state, wearing regular comfortable clothing. At the beginning of the laboratory session participants’ age, gender, years spent in formal education, highest educational qualification, household income, occupation, occupation physical activity level (sedentary, moderately active, or active), and postcode (zip-code) will be recorded. Height will be measured using a stadiometer (Seca 213, Hamburg, Germany) and weight will be measured using scales (Seca 813, Hamburg, Germany). Body mass index (BMI) will be calculated using these height and weight values. Inclusion and exclusion criteria will also be assessed at this point. Executive function measures Executive function will be measured using the Cambridge Automated Neuropsychological Test Battery (CANTAB), the verbal fluency task from the Delis Kaplan Executive Function System [ 32 ], and the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function – Adult Version® (BRIEF-A) [ 33 ]. CANTAB® is an automated, computerised, cognitive test battery that is considered to be the gold standard in cognitive testing. The tests are language independent, have parallel forms to allow repeat testing, are well validated, and have a large normative database. Participants will complete six executive function-related tests over a period of approximately 60 minutes. These are: 1) attention-switching (ability to switch attention between the direction of an arrow and its location on the screen and to ignore task-irrelevant information in the face of interfering or distracting events; taking approximately 7 minutes to complete), 2) intra-extra dimensional set shifting (a test of rule acquisition and reversal, similar to the Wisonsin Card-Sorting test; taking approximately 8 minutes to complete), 3) spatial working memory (a test of the participant’s ability to retain spatial information and to manipulate remembered items in working memory; taking approximately 8 minutes to complete), 4) stockings of Cambridge (a spatial planning test; taking approximately 10 minutes to complete), 5) choice reaction time (a 2-choice reaction time test involving two possible stimuli and two possible responses; taking approximately 7 minutes to complete), and 6) the stop-signal test (a measure of an individual’s ability to inhibit a prepotent response; taking approximately 20 minutes to complete). All participants will complete a motor screening task first to familiarise themselves with the touch screen system. The verbal fluency task (D-KEFS) [ 32 ] requires participants to name as many words as they can that begin with each of 3 letters (F, A, and S). They have 60 seconds per letter. Completion of the full task takes approximately 5 minutes. Participants are instructed to avoid names, place names, numbers, repetitions, and the same word with different endings (e.g. fish, fishing, fished). Higher scores indicate high levels of cognitive flexibility. Raw scores are converted to scaled scores normed by age and gender. The verbal fluency task is sensitive to differences between individuals with impaired executive functions and non-impaired controls [ 34 , 35 ]. Finally, the BRIEF-A [ 33 ] is a 75-item standardized paper and pencil measure that captures an adult’s perceived executive function efficiency and self-regulatory ability in their everyday environment. The BRIEF-A takes 8-10 minutes to complete. The self-report version used here taps two global factors of executive function: behavioural regulation (comprised of inhibition, shifting, self-monitoring, and emotional control) and metacognition (comprised of initiation, working memory, planning, organisation of materials, and task-monitoring). The measure includes three additional validity scales measuring Negativity, Inconsistency, and Infrequency. The BRIEF-A is standardized and validated for use with men and women aged 18 to 90 years. The normative sample includes adults from a range of racial/ethnic backgrounds, educational backgrounds, and is matched to U.S. Census data [ 36 ]. The BRIEF-A has demonstrated high internal consistency (alphas range from .93-.96), good test-retest correlations (.82-.93 over 4 weeks), and adequate convergent and divergent validity [ 37 ]. Dietary and physical activity intentions, past behaviour, and automaticity Dietary intentions will be measured using six items. The stem ‘over the next week…’ will be followed by ‘I intend to avoid eating’\u2009, ‘I want to avoid eating’\u2009, and ‘I expect to avoid eating’\u2009, in relation to ‘non-core snacks like cakes, biscuits, crisps and sweets’\u2009, and ‘I intend to eat’\u2009, ‘I want to eat’\u2009, and ‘I expect to eat’\u2009, in relation to ‘5 portions of fruit and veg a day’. Past dietary behaviour will be assessed with 2 items: ‘Over the last week…’ ‘I avoided eating non-core snacks like cakes, biscuits, crisps and sweets’, and ‘I ate 5 portions of fruit and veg a day’. Responses to each of these items will be made using a 5-point Likert scale from Strongly Agree – Strongly Disagree. Dietary automaticity will be assessed using the 4 item Self Report Behavioural Automaticity Index [ 38 ] for ‘Eating non-core snacks like cakes, biscuits, crisps and sweets is something…’ and for ‘Eating 5 portions of fruit and veg a day is something…’\u2009, followed by ‘I do automatically’\u2009, ‘I do without having to consciously remember’\u2009, ‘I do without thinking’\u2009, and ‘I start doing before I realise I’m doing it’. Responses ranged from 1 (strongly agree) to 7 (strongly disagree). The previously described items were altered to measure physical activity intentions, past behaviour, and automaticity, in relation to the target behaviours of ‘doing at least 30 minutes of moderate activity on most days of the week’ and ‘spending less than 2 hours of my leisure time each day sitting down (e.g. watching TV, at the computer, etc)’. Completion of the diet and physical activity intention/past behaviour/automaticity items takes 3-4 minutes. General intelligence Raven’s Standard Progressive Matrices (SPM) [ 39 ] will be used to assess general intelligence. SPM consists of 60 non-verbal multiple choice puzzles where participants must correctly choose from a selection of elements the one that best completes a pictured pattern. The test is well validated and normed for use with individuals 17 years and older [ 40 ]. Completion takes 20-30 minutes. Factors influencing reporting style The 20-item Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) [ 41 ] will be used to measure general affect, so that the effect of negative mood on reporting can be controlled for. Participants rate the extent to which they have experienced each of ten positive emotions (interested, excited, strong, enthusiastic, proud, alert, inspired, determined, attentive, active) and 10 negative emotions (afraid, distressed, upset, guilty, scared, hostile, irritable, ashamed, nervous, jittery) over the last few weeks, using a five-point scale from ‘very slightly or not at all’ to ‘very much’. There is good reliability and validity evidence for the PANAS [ 42 ] and the measure takes approximately 3 minutes to complete. The 16-item Social Desirability Scale [ 43 ] is a measure of the tendency to present oneself in a socially desirable way. Participants will be asked whether a range of socially desirable but infrequent and socially undesirable but frequent behaviours are things that they do (‘true’ or ‘false’). Completion takes around 5 minutes. Higher scores indicate greater social desirability bias. This measure is used to control for the effects of social desirability bias in questionnaire reporting and has adequate reliability and validity [ 43 ]. Subjective social status A visual scale represented by a ten-rung ladder will be used to measure individual’s subjective social status. Participants are instructed to place an ‘x’ on the rung that they feel best represents where they stand at their current point in life, relative to other people in the UK, in terms of wealth, education, and job status. Completion takes less than a minute. Subjective social status has been shown to be a good predictor of health status and health status change [ 44 ]. Test order will be randomly determined for each participant using a random number generator. At the end of the laboratory session participants will be given a booklet containing information relevant to the week of real-time assessment. This will contain a study overview, researcher contact details, descriptions of each of the measurement devices to be used, and some frequently asked questions. Additionally, the booklet will contain descriptions of the non-core snack foods of interest in the study, descriptions of sedentary, moderate, and vigorous activity, and definitions of fruit and vegetable portion sizes. The research team member will talk through the information book with the participant and answer any questions regarding the real-time measurement phase of the study. Real-time measurement phase Real-time measurements of snacking, fruit and vegetable consumption, physical activity, mood, context, and executive function will be recorded using the PRO-Diary (CamNtech Ltd., Cambridge, UK). The PRO-Diary is a compact wrist-worn electronic diary that will be used to gather self-reported data. The device measures 5.1 × 3.4 × 0.8 cm and weighs 16 g. The rechargeable battery lasts for up to 30 days (depending on usage). The PRO-Diary is wrist-worn so participants are unlikely to leave it somewhere, as they might with a similar non-wrist-worn device e.g. a PDA. Additionally, the device records the time of an event and therefore data can be time-matched to data from other measures (i.e. GPS and activity monitor). There is little available validity evidence for this device, but responses seem to correspond well with those made using traditional pen and paper scales [ 45 ]. The PRO-Diary will be used in the present study to measure the behaviours and psychological constructs of interest; namely non-core snack food consumption, portions of fruit and vegetables consumed, time spent in moderate and sedentary behaviours, mood, context, and executive function. Schedule The diaries will use a fixed-interval measurement schedule, giving an audible alarm (beep) every 60 minutes between the hours of 7.50am and 9.50pm. This assessment schedule was chosen to (a) minimise recall errors associated with longer assessment windows, (b) ensure that all episodes of snacking over the day are captured, (c) to minimise interruption to scheduled tasks likely to begin on the hour (e.g. appointments, classes, meetings), and (d) to allow data to be subdivided into 1 hour periods to facilitate integration with data from multiple other devices. The diaries include a snooze function to delay inconvenient responses. If the participant chooses to snooze or ignore the diary, it will beep again in 20 minutes (i.e. 10 minutes past the hour). Food intake The target dietary behaviours to be measured are eating ‘non-core’ snack foods and eating fruits and vegetables. Participants will be presented with the statement ‘Over the last hour’, and will respond ‘yes’ or ‘no’\u2009, in relation to having eaten any of the following snack foods: Chocolate/sweets, Biscuits/cakes/pastries, Crisps/savoury snacks, Savoury pies/pastries, Takeaway /fast food, Soft drinks, and Alcohol. These snacks are defined as non-core foods; that is foods that are surfeit to daily requirements, and are not classified within any of the main food groups recommended for daily consumption [ 46 ]. If participants respond ‘yes’ to having eaten any of these snacks, they will then be asked to indicate the portion size from the following options: small, typical, or large/multiple. In order to assess fruit and vegetable consumption participants will report how many portions they have consumed in the past hour, on a scale of 0 to 5. Self-reported activity/sedentary behaviour The target activity behaviours are time spent in moderate/vigorous physical activity and time spent in sedentary behaviours. Participants will be presented with the statements ‘Minutes moderately/vigorously active?’ and ‘Minutes sitting?’\u2009, and will respond on a scale of 0 to 60 minutes (in 5 minute increments) for each. As participants’ interpretations of terms such as active and sedentary may vary markedly, they will be provided with definitions and examples of each construct in the participant information booklet. Again, these questions will be asked in relation to ‘over the last hour’. Mood Information on mood will also be collected. We are specifically interested in three aspects of affect. These are hedonic tone, tense arousal, and energetic arousal [ 47 ]. These three dimensions are important for the current study research questions because positive affect (hedonic tone) is known to replenish self regulatory resources [ 48 ], and stress (tense arousal), perceived tiredness, and lack of energy (energetic arousal) are all associated with self-regulatory depletion [ 49 , 50 ]. Each of the sub-components of affect will be represented by two items. These are happy and sad (hedonic tone), calm and stressed (tense arousal), and alert and tired (energetic arousal). These items will be rated on uni-polar scales from 0-100, anchored with ‘Not at all’ and ‘Extremely’. Responses for each item will be in relation to ‘Just before the beep, I was…’. Contextual factors Information on context will be recorded because we are interested in the association between individual’s decisions in relation to their social and physical environment. Using the prompt ‘Just before the beep, I was…’, participants will provide information on 1) their level of hunger (response on a sliding scale anchored with ‘Not at All’ and ‘Extremely’), 2) who they are with (response options include alone, friends, family, colleagues, other), 3) where they are (response options include home, work, outdoors, car, shops/pub/restaurant, other), and 4) what they are doing (response options include work, domestic chores, childcare, socialising, travelling, TV/computer, sports/exercise, eating/drinking, nothing, other). Executive function Finally, immediately following response to these questions participants will complete a specially designed objective assessment of their executive function levels, known as a GoNoGo task. This task requires the rapid initiation and inhibition of responses, providing a measure of a participant’s ability to regulate behaviour in line with demands. Participants are presented with a randomly ordered sequence of letters (Ms and Ws) each displayed for 500 ms. Inter stimulus interval (ISI) varies from trial to trial between 5 different (but equi-probable) intervals: 1300 ms, 1500 ms, 1700 ms, 1900 ms, and 2100 ms. Participants are asked to respond as quickly as possible to Ms (‘Go’) by pressing a button on the diary, and to make no response to Ws (‘NoGo’). Participants will complete a block of 50 experimental trials every hour, comprising 40 Ms and 10Ws (80%:20% ratio of Go:NoGo). Reaction time to Go stimuli and incorrect responses to NoGo stimuli are recorded. Greater numbers of commission errors (i.e. Go to NoGo stimuli) indicates poorer inhibition. As stimulus order is not predictable, practice effects on repeat assessment of this task are likely to be minimal. Participants will spend approximately 3 minutes every hour completing the questions and GoNoGo task. This will be shorter if the participant indicates that they have consumed no food during the preceding hour, as the question schedule is designed to skip the food-related questions in such cases. Objectively measured physical activity In addition to the self-reported diary entries, physical activity will be continuously objectively recorded using the Actigraph GT3X\u2009+\u2009accelerometer. The ActiGraph GT3X\u2009+\u2009is a small (4.6 cm × 3.3 cm × 1.5 cm) and lightweight (19 g) tri-axial activity monitor that provides data on physical activity including activity counts, energy expenditure, steps, and activity intensity (METs). The device will be hip-worn on an elastic belt and activity will be measured across three planes (vertical, front-to-back, and side-to-side). The GT3X\u2009+\u2009has an inclinometer to determine subject position (e.g. sitting, lying, and standing) and to identify periods when the device is removed. Data are recorded in a raw format, using a sampling rate of 30 Hertz. Data filtering and epoch selection will be performed after data collection; an epoch of 1 minute will be selected to allow for data integration with data from other devices. The device is capable of collecting data for up to 40 days, using its 512 MB of available memory, comfortably accommodating our 7-day protocol. The GT3X\u2009+\u2009has been shown to be a valid measure of physical activity when worn on the waist [ 51 ]. Heart rate and heart rate variability The Actiheart (CamNtech Ltd. Cambridge, UK) is a chest-worn device (attached via ECG pads) that very accurately measures heart rate and physical activity (activity is measured using an accelerometer- piezoelectric element). Available epochs (sampling periods) are 15 s, 30 s, or 1 min, and data can be collected for a maximum of 4 days when set to record heart rate variability data (an indication of the variation in time intervals between heart beats). There is strong validity and reliability evidence for the Actiheart [ 52 ]. Using this device average beats per minute (BPM), and the average of the absolute values of successive differences in R-R intervals in msec (mean of successive differences) will be recorded. The latter is highly correlated with vagal sources of heart rate variability (HRV) [ 53 ]. Tonic heart rate variability (HRV) may be a physiological indicator of the current level of cognitive, emotional, and behaviour regulation [ 54 , 55 ]. HRV reflects the effects of sympathetic and parasympathetic neural activity on the beat to beat variation in heart rate. Importantly, the neural structures involved in modulating HRV are also linked to the brain structures involved in the control of higher order goal directed action [ 56 ], and higher HRV is linked to several facets of executive functioning, including cognitive flexibility, less negative affect during stress emotion regulation, less experience of negative affect during stress, effective impulse control, and critically for the present study – resisting dietary temptation [ 57 – 61 ]. Participants will be instructed to wear the Actiheart during waking hours only, for the first four days of the 7-day measurement period as the device can only record data for this period of time. Location Participants’ location will be tracked using the iTrail (BrickHouse Security) GPS device. The iTrail is a small (4.6 cm × 4.1 cm × 1.3 cm) and lightweight (37g) GPS tracking device. Data (map co-ordinates) are collected at 1-minute intervals, and stored across the first 5 of the 7 measurement days (the device only has sufficient battery life to record for 5 days). The iTrail will be positioned on the elastic belt alongside the Actigraph GT3X+. The device has only one button on the front which will be disabled during initialization, meaning that participants will not be able to tamper with the device or press the button unintentionally. Data from this device will be integrated with information from a Geographic Information System (GIS) to provide information about distance from food outlets, distance from home/work, distance from green-space, and distance from recreational facilities. Additionally, because all the data collected using the devices mentioned above are time-stamped; they can be time-matched to investigate how the different behaviours of interest co-occur. All devices involved in the study will be worn during waking hours only. At the end of the real time measurement period, a member of the research team will collect all measurement equipment from each participant. Data processing The multiple measurements obtained at several time points each day across seven days generates large quantities of data. For each participant a purpose-written computer macro will be used to match data from each device based on date and time stamps. This will be done using the R programming language (R version 3.0.2, R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). This will produce a long-form data file where each row corresponds to minute-level data. Any data generated at a higher resolution than 1-sample per minute will be aggregated to the minute-level (i.e. Actiheart energy expenditure data which was recorded using a 15-second epoch). PRO-Diary question data will be replicated across the preceding hour to which the responses corresponded, because these questions relate to ‘over the last hour’. PRO-Diary GoNoGo task data will be replicated over the following hour, as these data will be used to predict subsequent eating and activity behaviour. Data analyses and sample size calculations Statistical analyses will be conducted using SPSS (IBM SPSS statistics version 21, Armonk, NY) and MLwiN (MLwiN version 2.28, Bristol Centre for Multilevel Modelling, UK). Descriptive statistics will be calculated for relevant variables. We will investigate our primary research question using 3-level multilevel models nesting hourly epochs within days within individuals, where significant outcome variability at each level permits [ 62 , 63 ]. We will build models to test within-person real-time associations of executive functioning (GoNoGo reaction time for correct responses) with snacking behaviour (high calorie intake) and sedentary behaviour (physical activity counts), and cross-level interaction effects of trait (BRIEF-A/CANTAB outcomes) and state (Go NoGo) executive functioning on real-time snacking and sedentary behaviour. Multilevel models will control for time of day, and all epoch-level or day-level predictors will be person-centred. It is very likely in a demanding protocol of this nature that there will be higher than average levels of missing data. However, multilevel modelling is robust to the biasing effects of missing data when maximum likelihood estimation methods are used [ 64 ] so imputation of missing data will not be necessary.MLPowSim (Bristol Centre for Multilevel Modelling, UK) and R (R version 3.0.2, R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) packages were used for sample size calculations. For the primary research question concerned with the association between executive function at a given time point and subsequent snacking the power calculations estimate a required sample of around 50 participants each with between 65 and 85 observations (i.e. repeated within-person assessments) for a power of 80%. The power curves for a combination of level2 (participants) and level 1 (observations) values are displayed in Figure 1 . Figure 1 Multilevel power calculations by sample size and number of observations. Full size image Discussion The executive functions likely play an important role in controlling goal-directed health behaviours, including snack food consumption. Previous studies have demonstrated the association between executive function and the consumption of unhealthy foods. Specifically, these studies have shown that individuals with weak executive control eat fewer fruits and vegetables and more snacks than intended [ 10 ], consume more chocolate given the opportunity to eat freely [ 12 ], and that stronger executive control resources are associated with lower frequency of fatty food consumption [ 8 ]. Additionally, manipulation of self-control resource via resource-depleting tasks results in reduced capacity to regulate intake of unhealthy foods [ 15 , 16 ]. However, these studies have only determined cross-sectional between-person associations or obtained findings from contrived laboratory experiments designed to manipulate self-control resource, and little is known about how the executive functions co-vary with behaviours such as snacking within people over time. The SNAPSHOT study aims to determine how within-person fluctuations in the executive functions relate to the deleterious health behaviours of snacking and sedentary behaviour. This study is unique in that it uses momentary assessment techniques to provide ecologically valid data on real-time fluctuations in the efficiency of self-regulatory control. Gaining a better understanding of how the executive functions co-vary with behaviours such as snacking and sedentary behaviour will provide valuable information about how best to intervene to change such behaviours and will allow theories about the cognitive control of behaviour to be tested within people over time.

By Oh, Hwajung,Taylor, Adrian H. Health Psychology, Vol 33(4), Apr 2014, 349-359 Abstract Objective: Emotional snacking contributes to weight gain after smoking cessation. Exercise acutely reduces cravings for cigarettes and snack food. This study examined if different exercise intensities acutely reduces snack and cigarette cravings and attentional bias (AB) to video clips of snacks and cigarettes among abstinent smokers. Methods: Abstinent smokers (and snackers; N = 23) randomly did 15 mins of moderate and vigorous cycling and a passive control in a cross-over design. Visual initial AB (IAB) and maintained AB (MAB) were assessed pre- and after treatment while watching paired snacking/neutral or smoking/neutral video clips. Desire to snack and smoke were assessed throughout. Results: ANOVAs revealed significant condition × time interactions for initial and maintained AB for smoking [IAB: F (1.58, 34.75) = 3.58, MAB: F (2, 44) = 4.52, p < .05] and snacking [IAB: F (2, 44) = 8.13, MAB: F (2, 44) = 5.08, p < .01]. IAB for both smoking and snacking were lower after moderate and vigorous exercise than the control. MAB was lower only after vigorous exercise. Fully repeated ANOVAs revealed a condition × time interaction for desire to smoke, F (3.31, 72.75) = 12.62, and snack F (4.34, 95.52) = 9.51, p < .001. Cravings were lower after moderate and vigorous exercise, compared with control. Conclusions: Exercise acutely reduces both AB and cravings for cigarettes and snacks and may help self-regulation of smoking and snacking. Vigorous exercise was only more advantageous for reducing MAB.

We’ve all been there. But what if I told you that the key to conquering that afternoon slump and boosting your overall productivity at work might be hiding in your gym bag? Here at Holly Roser Fitness in New York City, we’ve seen firsthand how physical fitness can transform not just bodies, but careers. As a personal trainer who’s worked with countless professionals in Manhattan, I’ve witnessed the remarkable impact that regular exercise can have on workplace performance. But don’t just take my word for it. Let’s dive into the science behind why staying fit could be your secret weapon for crushing it at the office. The Mind-Body Connection: How Exercise Boosts Brain Power Sharper Focus and Enhanced Cognitive Function Ever notice how after a good workout, your mind feels clearer? There’s a reason for that. Exercise isn’t just about building muscle; it’s a full-blown brain booster. A groundbreaking study published in the “Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research” found that just 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise can significantly improve cognitive function, including better decision-making skills and increased attention span (Mandolesi et al., 2018). “Physical activity is associated with improved cognitive performance and enhanced brain function across the lifespan.” This means that hitting the gym before work or squeezing in a lunchtime jog could actually help you tackle that challenging project with newfound clarity. Stress Reduction: Your Natural Productivity Enhancer Let’s face it, workplace stress is a productivity killer. But here’s the good news: regular exercise is like a natural stress-buster. When you work out, your body releases endorphins, those feel-good chemicals that act as natural painkillers and mood elevators. A study in the “Journal of Occupational Health Psychology” revealed that employees who engaged in regular physical activity reported lower levels of job stress and higher levels of job satisfaction (Eschleman et al., 2019). Lower stress levels mean you’re less likely to get bogged down by workplace pressures, allowing you to maintain focus and efficiency throughout the day. Energy Levels and Stamina: Fueling Your Workday Combating Fatigue: The Exercise Paradox It might seem counterintuitive, but expending energy through exercise actually gives you more energy overall. As a fitness coach, I’ve heard countless clients say, “I’m too tired to work out.” But here’s the kicker: regular physical activity can actually combat fatigue and increase energy levels. A study published in the “Psychological Bulletin” found that sedentary individuals who started a regular exercise program reported reduced fatigue levels of up to 65% compared to groups that did not exercise (Puetz et al., 2006). Imagine tackling your workload with 65% more energy – that’s a game-changer! Improved Sleep Quality: The Foundation of Productivity Quality sleep is crucial for workplace productivity, and guess what? Regular exercise can help you sleep better. A study in the “Journal of Sleep Research” showed that people who engaged in moderate-intensity exercise experienced improved sleep quality and duration (Kredlow et al., 2015). Better sleep means you’re more likely to wake up refreshed and ready to tackle your workday with vigor. It’s a virtuous cycle: exercise improves sleep, better sleep improves productivity, and increased productivity gives you more time and energy for exercise. Physical Health: Reducing Sick Days and Presenteeism Boosting Immune Function Nothing derails productivity quite like getting sick. The good news? Regular exercise can give your immune system a significant boost. A study in the “Journal of Sport and Health Science” found that moderate-intensity exercise can enhance the body’s immune response, potentially reducing the risk of upper respiratory tract infections (Nieman & Wentz, 2019). Fewer sick days mean more time at your desk, crushing your goals. But it’s not just about showing up – it’s about showing up at your best. Combating Presenteeism: Being There vs. Being Productive Presenteeism – being physically present at work but not fully functioning due to illness or other health conditions – can be just as detrimental to productivity as absenteeism. Regular exercise can help combat the underlying health issues that lead to presenteeism. A study in the “Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine” found that employees who participated in a workplace wellness program that included physical activity showed significant improvements in presenteeism over time (Cancelliere et al., 2011). Mental Health: The Often Overlooked Productivity Factor Exercise as a Natural Antidepressant Mental health is a crucial component of workplace productivity, and exercise plays a vital role in maintaining it. Regular physical activity has been shown to be an effective tool in managing symptoms of depression and anxiety, which can significantly impact work performance. A meta-analysis published in the “Journal of Psychiatric Research” found that exercise can be as effective as antidepressant medication in treating mild to moderate depression (Kvam et al., 2016). When you’re in a better mental state, you’re more likely to engage fully with your work and collaborate effectively with colleagues. Building Resilience: Bouncing Back from Workplace Challenges The workplace can be unpredictable, with challenges and setbacks a normal part of any career. Physical fitness can help build the mental resilience needed to navigate these hurdles effectively. Research published in the “Frontiers in Psychology” journal suggests that regular exercise can enhance psychological resilience, helping individuals better cope with stress and adversity (Childs & de Wit, 2014). This increased resilience translates directly to the workplace, allowing you to bounce back from setbacks more quickly and maintain productivity in the face of challenges. Social Benefits: Teamwork and Communication Building Workplace Relationships Through Fitness Physical fitness activities can serve as excellent team-building opportunities. Whether it’s joining a company sports team or participating in group fitness classes, these activities foster camaraderie and improve communication among colleagues. A study in the “Journal of Workplace Behavioral Health” found that employees who participated in workplace exercise programs reported improved coworker relationships and a more positive work environment (Coulson et al., 2008). These stronger social bonds can lead to better collaboration and, ultimately, increased productivity. Confidence Boost: Presenting Your Best Self Regular exercise not only improves your physical appearance but also boosts self-confidence. This increased confidence can have a profound impact on your workplace performance, from more assertive communication to taking on leadership roles. Research published in the “Journal of Health Psychology” indicates that physical exercise is positively associated with self-esteem (Spence et al., 2005). When you feel good about yourself, you’re more likely to contribute ideas, take on challenges, and perform at your best. Implementing Fitness in Your Work Routine Start Small: The Power of Micro-Workouts Incorporating fitness into your workday doesn’t mean you need to spend hours at the gym. Even short bursts of activity can make a difference. Try these micro-workout ideas: Take a 5-minute walk every hour Do a set of desk push-ups or squats during breaks Use a standing desk for part of your day Try chair yoga or stretching between tasks Remember, consistency is key. These small efforts add up over time and can significantly impact your overall fitness and productivity. Lunch Break Fitness: Maximize Your Midday Your lunch break is a golden opportunity to squeeze in a workout. Consider these options: Join a nearby gym for a quick 30-minute session Take a brisk walk or jog around the block Follow a short yoga or bodyweight exercise video in a quiet space Organize a group fitness activity with colleagues Not only will you get your blood pumping, but you’ll also return to work feeling refreshed and energized for the afternoon ahead. After-Work Routines: Setting Yourself Up for Success Establishing a consistent after-work fitness routine can help you decompress from the day and prepare for a productive tomorrow. Try these strategies: Schedule your workouts like you would any important meeting Pack your gym bag the night before to remove morning obstacles Find an accountability partner or join group classes for motivation Mix up your routines to keep things interesting and challenge different muscle groups Remember, the best workout is the one you’ll actually do consistently. Find activities you enjoy, and you’ll be more likely to stick with them. Overcoming Common Obstacles Time Management: Finding Minutes for Movement “I don’t have time to exercise” is a common refrain I hear as a personal trainer . But often, it’s not about finding more time; it’s about using the time you have more effectively. Try these time-saving tips: Wake up 30 minutes earlier for a morning workout Combine social time with exercise by meeting friends for a workout instead of happy hour Use your commute as an opportunity for exercise (bike to work or get off public transport a few stops early) Maximize efficiency with high-intensity interval training (HIIT) workouts Motivation: Staying Committed to Your Fitness Goals Motivation can be fleeting, especially when work demands pile up. Here’s how to stay on track: Set specific, measurable fitness goals that align with your work objectives Track your progress and celebrate small wins Find a workout buddy or join a fitness community for support Reward yourself for sticking to your routine (but not with food!) Remember, discipline often trumps motivation. Create a routine and stick to it, even on days when you don’t feel like it. The Role of Nutrition in Workplace Fitness While we’ve focused primarily on exercise, it’s important to note that nutrition plays a crucial role in both fitness and productivity. Fueling your body with the right foods can enhance the benefits of your fitness routine and keep you energized throughout the workday. Power-Packed Snacks for Sustained Energy Keep these healthy snacks at your desk to maintain steady energy levels: Mixed nuts and seeds for healthy fats and protein Fresh fruit for quick, natural energy boosts Greek yogurt with berries for protein and antioxidants Hummus with vegetable sticks for fiber and nutrients Hydration: The Unsung Hero of Productivity Don’t underestimate the power of staying hydrated. Even mild dehydration can impact cognitive function and energy levels. Keep a water bottle at your desk and aim to refill it several times throughout the day. Conclusion: Investing in Fitness for Career Success The link between physical fitness and workplace productivity is clear and compelling. From enhanced cognitive function and increased energy levels to improved mental health and team dynamics, the benefits of regular exercise extend far beyond the gym walls and directly into your professional life. As we’ve seen, incorporating fitness into your work routine doesn’t have to be a daunting task. Small, consistent efforts can lead to significant improvements in both your health and your career performance. Whether it’s taking the stairs instead of the elevator, scheduling a lunchtime workout, or joining a weekend sports league with colleagues, every step towards better fitness is a step towards greater productivity.

Exercise training intensity was moderate (65 to 75% of peak treadmill heart rate). During the 8-week study period VO 2 max increased significantly in both groups from 33.3 ± 3.2 to 37.9 ± 3.5 ml/kg/min in men performing long exercise bouts and from 32.1 ± 4.6 to 34.5 ± 4.5 ml/kg/ min in men performing short exercise bouts (p < 0.05 within and between groups). Adherence to unsupervised exercise training performed at home and at work by men in long and short bouts was high; total duration of training completed was 96 and 93% of the prescribed amount and total number of sessions completed was 92 and 93% of that prescribed, respectively. In both groups exercise heart rate measured by a portable microprocessor was within or above the prescribed range for >85% of the prescribed duration. Thus, multiple short bouts of moderate-intensity exercise training significantly increase peak oxygen uptake. For many individuals short bouts of exercise training may fit better into a busy schedule than a single long bout. Recommended articles References (13) M Juneau et al.

Current Sports Medicine Reports 14(2):p 104-109, March/April 2015. | DOI: 10.1249/JSR.0000000000000134 Free Metrics Abstract Physical activity and exercise training are underutilized by much of Westernized society, and physical inactivity may be the greatest threat to health in the 21st century. Many studies have shown a linear relationship between one’s activity level and heart health, leading to the conclusion that “if some exercise is good, more must be better.” However, there is evolving evidence that high levels of exercise may produce similar or less overall cardiovascular (CV) benefits compared with those produced by lower doses of exercise. Very high doses of exercise may be associated with increased risk of atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, and malignant ventricular arrhythmias. These acute bouts of excessive exercise may lead to cardiac dilatation, cardiac dysfunction, and release of troponin and brain natriuretic peptide. The effects of too little and too much exercise on the heart are reviewed in this article, along with recommendations to optimize the dose of exercise to achieve heart health. Introduction Considerable evidence indicates the profound benefits of physical activity (PA), exercise training (ET), and higher levels of cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) on lowering morbidity and mortality from heart disease ( 11,38,40 ). Recent studies have focused on the fact that PA levels do not meet national guidelines in a substantial percentage of the population in the United States, probably in 50% to 80% of the population, and most of the world ( 11,38,40 ), and physical inactivity may represent one of the greatest threats to health in the 21st century ( 5 ). Although excessive endurance exercise (EEE), defined as ET > 60 to 90 min per session, is not nearly as prevalent as low levels of PA, occurring in 2% to 5% of the population, there is a fallible logic that “if some exercise is good, then more must be better” ( 18 ). Certainly there are a substantial number of individuals exercising for many hours and on many days while regularly competing in long road races, such as marathons, or long bicycle and swimming races, such as triathlons, and even multiday events ( 18,27–30 ). Although most are of the belief that participation in high levels of PA is good for heart health, there is evolving evidence that a high level of EEE may be associated with risk of cardiotoxicity. In this review, we discuss the evidence proving the tremendous CV benefit of regular exercise along with the more recent and evolving evidence that high levels of ET may provide similar or even less overall benefit compared with that provided by low doses of ET. Additionally, we review the evidence that high levels of ET may be associated with increased risk of atrial fibrillation (AF), coronary artery disease (CAD), and malignant ventricular arrhythmias (VA). Furthermore this evidence suggests that acute bouts of EEE may lead to cardiac dilatation and dysfunction, especially on the right side of the heart and ventricular septum, in turn leading to the release of cardiac biomarkers, such as cardiac troponin and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), resulting in VA and increased risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD). Exercise and Heart Health Beginning in the 1950s with the seminal work of Morris et al. ( 23,24 ) and continuing in the 1970s with early studies by Paffenbarger et al. ( 31 ), the positive effects of exercise on heart health have been established clearly ( 11,38,40 ). Regular moderate exercise has been shown to be helpful for both the primary and secondary prevention of CVD in both men and women. For this and other reasons, the U.S. PA Guidelines recommend that all Americans engage in 30 min of moderate exercise (like a brisk walk) for 5 d·wk −1 or more, which equates to 150 min·wk −1 ( 11,38,40 ). The guidelines also point out that similar benefits can be obtained by engaging in more strenuous exercise (like jogging) for shorter periods of time, such that 15 min of jogging done 5 d·wk −1 (or 75 min·wk −1 ) appears to provide equivalent benefit to doing 150 min·wk −1 of walking. Risk of SCD with EEE The risk associated with EEE has been noted for centuries and evident recently with high-profile cases ( 18,27–30,32 ). During the Greco-Persian war in 490 BBC, Pheidippides, a 40-year-old Greek herald, ran almost 150 miles during a 2-d period to deliver urgent military messages. On the third day, he ran the 26 miles (actually 24.8, which may be significant because most cardiac events during marathons occur in the last mile) ( 29,32 ) from the battlefield near Marathon to Athens to deliver news of a momentous Greek victory. As per the legend, upon arriving, Pheidippides explained to the Athenians, “Victory is ours!”, and then he immediately collapsed and died. Now 2,500 years later, there are numerous examples of SCD associated with EEE, and in the best-selling book, Born to Run (Christopher McDougall, Knopf Publishers, 2009), Micah True is the mythical long distance runner, Caballo Blanco, who runs as far as 100 miles on some days. In 2012, while out on a relatively routine 12-mile training run, he died suddenly, presumably from a lethal arrhythmia. It is likely that the heart of this 58-year-old veteran endurance athlete showed manifestations of the “Pheidippides cardiomyopathy” ( 32 ). The number of Americans participating in marathons has increased by more than 25-fold over the past 40 years ( 27,29 ). Certainly high levels of CRF are generally associated with considerable cardioprotection and reduction in CVD. However, this is not translated into better reduction in CV or all-cause mortality among runners. Paradoxically, long-term marathon runners in some studies have been associated with increased, rather than decreased, CAD ( 18,27,29 ). However, perhaps the most serious consequence of EEE is SCD; although these relatively rare events often generate considerable publicity in major EEE events, SCD remains relatively uncommon ( 18,27–30,32 ). In fact, a recent study reviewed all marathons and half-marathons in the United States during a 10-year period (10.9 million runners and 59 cardiac arrests) and reported that SCD occurred in only 1 of 200,000 participants (0.54/100,000 participants) ( 13 ). However other studies suggest that the true occurrence may be two- to four-fold higher than this because the data from the study of Kim et al. ( 13 ) may be contaminated by a large number of half-marathoners and only accounted for SCD during the race itself and not soon afterwards ( 18,34,35 ). Nevertheless, the fatalities in marathons are still relatively uncommon, although the fatality rate in triathlons may be two-fold higher than running-only races, largely because of the increased CV events and SCD during the swim portion of the race ( 18,29,32 ); however, the data in marathons, as opposed to triathlons, are certainly more robust. The high-catecholamine state of such EEE competitions superimposed on preexisting ET-induced structural myocardial abnormalities is the most logical explanation for cases of SCD after common causes (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, CAD, anomalous coronaries, channelopathies, and other causes) are excluded. Effects on CV Structure and Function There are many potential adverse effects with EEE on cardiac structure and function ( Fig. 1 ) ( 29 ). In a recent animal study, rats were trained to run strenuously for 60 consecutive minutes daily for 16 wk ( 3 ). The ET rats, compared with controls, developed left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy, right ventricular (RV) hypertrophy, diastolic ventricular dysfunction, dilation of both the left and right atria (LA and RA, respectively), as well as considerable collagen deposition within the cardiac chambers. Serious VA were inducible in 42% of the running rats compared with only 6% of controls ( P = 0.05). After detraining, however, these adverse structural changes, as well as VA, largely reversed ( 3 ). Many previous animal studies also have found acute adverse CV effects of prolonged (up to 6 h) EEE, sometimes employing a rat model of cold water swimming, in which the animals were forced to swim to avoid drowning, thus reducing the clinical relevance due to excessive emotional strain in addition to the EEE ( 29,33 ). Figure 1: Proposed pathogenesis of cardiomyopathy in endurance athletes. BNP, B-type natriuretic peptide; CK-MB, creatine kinase MB. Reproduced with permission from O’Keefe et al. ( 29 ). However, similar adverse structural remodeling following EEE have been noted in humans ( 18,27–30,32 ). Accumulating evidence suggests that the adverse effects of both short-term intense PA and cumulative EEE are most evident in the right-side cardiac chambers (RV and RA). At rest, average cardiac output in an average size human is approximately 5 L·min −1 , and this typically increases by five-fold to about 25 L·min −1 during vigorous ET. During chronic long-term exposure to prolonged, high-intensity ET, this increased cardiac output may place more strain on the thinner wall, smaller, right-side cardiac chambers compared with the left side of the heart. Following a marathon, for example, approximately 30% of runners develop acute dilation of cardiac structures, especially the RV and RA, and dysfunction of the RV and ventricular septum. During the postrace period, the cardiac geometric dimensions are restored, but with this recurrent stretch of the chambers and reestablishment of chamber geometry, some individuals may be prone to the development of chronic structural changes, including chronic dilation of the LA, RA, and RV, as well as patchy myocardial scarring in response to the recurrent volume load and excessive cardiac strain. Although these abnormalities are typically asymptomatic and resolve over 24 to 72 h, if they accrue over many years, they may predispose to potentially serious arrhythmias, such as AF and/or VA ( 18,27–30,32 ). In one prospective study of 25 runners (12 men and 13 women), Trivax et al. ( 39 ) found that running a marathon caused acute dilation of the RA and RV, with a sudden fall in RV ejection fraction (EF). Similarly La Gerche et al. ( 14 ) studied 40 highly trained aerobic athletes after competing in EEE events (marathons, mean time 3 h; half Ironman triathlons, mean time 5.5 h; full Ironman, mean time 11 h; and Alpine Cycling race, mean time 8 h). On postrace echocardiograms, they noted increases in RV volume and reduced RVEF (but not LVEF) ( Fig. 2 ) and found elevations in biomarkers (troponin and BNP), which correlated with the fall in RVEF. These abnormalities in cardiac structure returned entirely to baseline within the first few weeks and are noted more typically in races of long duration. Of this cohort, 5 of the 40 (12.5%) had myocardial scarring detected on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), as demonstrated by late gadolinium enhancement (LGE). Therefore these studies suggest that intense EEE induces RV dysfunction, which largely spares the LV (except for possibly the ventricular septum shared by both ventricles). Even when short-term RV recovery appears to be complete, potentially long-term ET and competition in EEE races may lead to myocardial fibrosis eventually, which potentially could predispose malignant VA. Figure 2: Differential effect of prolonged intense exercise on RV and LV volumes. Baseline volumes are shown on the left, and the changes in volume after the race are shown on the right. RV volumes increased in the postrace setting, whereas LV volumes decreased, resulting in a decrease in RVEF but not in LVEF. Reproduced with permission from La Gerche et al. ( 14 ). Another study by Ector et al. ( 8 ) reported that the reduction in RVEF seemed less significant in asymptomatic athletes compared with that in EEE competitors who have symptoms of arrhythmias, in which RV dilation and reductions in RVEF were more pronounced. In another study, those endurance athletes had a 12% prevalence of RV abnormalities by MRI ( 6 ). Other studies also have confirmed the long-term adverse effects on myocardial structure ( 18,27–30,32 ), including one study suggesting that the CAD event rate during 2-year follow-up was significantly higher in the athletes than that in controls ( P < 0.0001) ( 6 ). Impact of EEE on CAD Recent studies have suggested that long distance runners may have increased levels of atherosclerosis and CAD ( 18,37 ). In a study 6 years ago, male marathon runners had paradoxically increased coronary artery calcification (CAC) as measured by computed tomography (CT) CAC scoring ( 21 ). A very recent study of men who completed at least one marathon yearly for 25 consecutive years ( n = 50) compared with 23 sedentary controls demonstrated increased total plaque volume ( P < 0.01), calcified plaque volume ( P < 0.0001), and noncalcified plaque volume ( P = 0.04) compared with those with EEE ( Fig. 3 ) ( 37 ). Despite the fact that runners have better overall CAD risk profiles, these results underscore the potential for very heavy EEE to increase the severity of CAD through mechanisms largely independent of the traditional CAD risk factors. Figure 3: Marathoners had significantly more total coronary plaque volume, noncalcified plaque volume, and calcified plaque volume compared with those of control subjects. Reproduced with permission from Schwartz et al. ( 37 ). A very recent study by Möhlenkamp et al. ( 22 ) assessed 108 marathon runners and 864 age-matched controls as well as 216 age- and risk factor-matched controls. Recreational marathon runners with myocardial fibrosis by MRI-LGE had higher troponin release than those without LGE. Higher CAC scores and LGE, as opposed to troponin release (which was present in 37% of the marathoners), predicted subsequent CAD events, which were overall similar between marathoners and risk factor-matched nonmarathon controls. Impact of ET on Risk of AF We recently evaluated various risk factors, including metabolic factors, for the risk of AF ( 19,20 ). Certainly many epidemiologic and observational studies, although not all ( 26 ), have reported a strong statistically significant association between chronic high-intensity ET and elevated risk of AF ( 1,19,20 ). The impact of habitual PA and ET on the risk of AF appears to be nonlinear, with lower rates of AF among moderately active individuals compared with those among sedentary controls, whereas an increased risk of AF was noted among individuals performing EEE or long bouts of high-intensity ET ( 18,27–30,32 ). The mechanism of AF with high ET is uncertain, but this may involve acute fluxes in cathecholamines and autonomic tone, atrial stretch, and RV cardiomyopathy. In a study of 44,410 Swedish men, intense ET of >5 h·wk −1 at age 30 years increased the risk of AF later in life, whereas moderate-intensity PA reduced the risk of AF ( 7 ). In a study of 5,446 older athletes (mean age, 73 years), again low- and moderate-intensity PA progressively reduced the risk of AF, whereas the rate slightly increased in those with high-intensity PA (slightly more risk than light intensity but still lower than nonexercisers) ( 25 ). In nearly 53,000 long distance cross country skiers from Sweden, there was more AF with the greater amount of cross-country races and the fastest finishing times ( 2 ). However, with detraining and moderation of ET dose, there is atrial remodeling and normalization of autonomic tone and reduction of AF risk. Recent Running Studies and U-Shaped Curve Three very recent running studies have demonstrated the U-shaped relationship between running doses and CV diseases and all-cause mortality ( 15,36,41 ). The Copenhagen City Heart Study followed 1,878 runners and 10,158 nonrunners for up to 35 years ( 28,36 ). The runners had an impressive 44% lower risk of mortality during follow-up, with an average 6-year extension in life expectancy. However, a U-shaped curve was apparent for mortality with respect to running dose, with the peak benefit noted with slow-to-moderate running speeds, frequency of about 3 times per week, and 1 to 2 h·wk −1 of running. Very high doses of running, however, were associated with trends of worse survival compared with either nonrunners or groups of low- and moderate-dose runners. Data from 55,000 people from the Aerobic Center Longitudinal Study, including 13,000 runners and 42,000 nonrunners, followed for an average of 15 years, have been reported recently ( 15 ). During follow-up, runners had impressive reductions in all-cause and CV mortality of 30% and 45%, respectively, with an average increase in life expectancy of 3 years. Persistent runners had the greatest event reduction, whereas those who began running and stopped or vice versa received about half of the full beneficial effect. However, when dividing runners into quintiles of doses (miles·wk −1 , running days per week, min·wk −1 , and running speed), with the exception of speed (faster running always had a trend for better survival), quintile 1 (<6 miles·wk −1 , 1 to 2 times per week, <51 min·wk −1 ) had similar mortality reductions as those in quintiles 2 to 4 and a trend to slightly greater benefit than those in quintile 5 ( Fig. 4 ). The individuals performing higher running doses generally have higher levels of CRF; and in almost all studies in the literature, higher levels of CRF are associated with lower CV and all-cause mortality rates. However, among runners (who already have high levels of CRF even when running at lower volumes), low doses of running provide maximal protection against all-cause and CV mortality ( 15 ). Figure 4: Central illustration: hazard ratios (HR) of all-cause and CV mortality by running characteristic (weekly running time, distance, frequency, total amount, and speed). Participants were classified into six groups: nonrunners (reference group) and five quintiles of each running characteristic. All HR were adjusted for baseline age (yr), sex, examination year, smoking status (never, former, or current), alcohol consumption (heavy drinker or not), other physical activities except running (0, 1 to 499, or 500MET·min·wk −1 ), and parental history of CV disease (yes or no). All P values for HR across running characteristics were <0.05 for all-cause and CV mortality except for running frequency of six times a week ( P = 0.11) and speed of <6.0 miles/hyperlipidemia ( P = 0.10) for CV mortality. Reproduced with permission from Lee et al. ( 15 ). Additionally, in a study of 24,000 patients with CAD with a history of myocardial infarction, those doing more ET had progressive reductions in CV mortality, up to a point ( Figs. 5 and 6 ) ( 41 ). At running doses of >30 miles·wk −1 (or walking >46 miles·wk −1 ), there appears to be partial loss of the ET benefit on CV mortality ( 41 ). Figure 5: Categorical model. Cox proportional survival analyses of the risk of CVD-related mortality vs MET-hours per day run or walked. Relative risk is calculated for 1.07 to 1.8, 1.8 to 3.6, 3.6 to 5.4, 5.4 to 7.2, and 7.2 MET·h·d −1 or more relative to the inadequate exercisers (<1.07 MET·h·d −1 ). “All CVD-related” mortality includes both “CVD as an underlying cause” and “CVD as a contributing cause for some other underlying cause.” Significance levels are coded as follows: a P ≤ 0.05; b P ≤ 0.01; and c P ≤ .001. The significance levels for 7.2 MET·h·d −1 or more vs less than 1.07 MET·h·d −1 were all nonsignificant, that is, P = 0.99 for all-cause mortality, P = 0.68 for all CVD-related mortality, and P = 0.46 for CVD as the underlying cause of death. MET·h·d −1 , metabolic equivalent of task-hours per day. Reproduced with permission from Williams et al. ( 41 ). Figure 6: Continuous model. Cox proportional survival analyses of the risk of CVD-related mortality vs MET-hours per day run or walked. In the model “α MET·h·d −1 trimmed (MET·h·d −1 if MET·h·d −1 ≤ 7.2, 7.2 otherwise) + β indicator function (1 = MET·h·d −1 ≥ 7.2, 0 otherwise) + covariates,” the hypothesis β = 0 tests whether the HR is increased significantly above 7.2 MET·h·d −1 relative to the HR at 7.2. Shown is the 15.4% average decrease in the risk for CVD-related mortality per MET-hours per day between 0 and 7.2 (95% confidence interval (CI), 8.9%–21.5%; P < 0.001) and a 2.62-fold risk increase above 7.2 MET·h·d −1 relative to the risk at 7.2 MET·h·d −1 (95%CI, 1.29- to 5.06-fold; P = 0.009). Reproduced with permission from Williams et al. ( 41 ). These studies all point to the fact that more does not appear to be better and low-to-moderate doses of running seem to be ideal for conferring long-term CV health and enhanced longevity ( 15,18,27–30,32,36,41 ). Nevertheless, over a decade ago, a study on more than 73,000 participants, mostly nonelite skiers, who had competed in a major ski race in Sweden demonstrated that participants had lower mortality from all causes, CV diseases, and cancers compared with age-adjusted mortality rates ( 10 ). Another recent study indicates that participants in the Olympics and professional sports also were associated with long-term protection against mortality from all causes, CV diseases, and cancers, suggesting that previous sports stardom is associated with overall excellent long-term prognosis ( 12 ). Optimal ET Dosing As Hippocrates said centuries ago, “Everything in excess is opposed to nature” ( 9 ). From a population perspective, lack of PA is much more prevalent than excessive ET. The PA Federal Guidelines call for 150 min·wk −1 of moderate PA or 75 min·wk −1 of vigorous PA. The Institute of Medicine suggests 60 min·d −1 of some PA. Recent evidence has suggested that very few are meeting these minimal requirements ( 11,38,40 ), and we have made a call to action that all clinicians should be promoting PA throughout the health care system ( 40 ). Evidence is mounting, however, that indicates a substantial number of individuals (perhaps 2% or 5% of the population) may be overdoing ET, at least from a health standpoint. If the current mantra “exercise is medicine” is embraced, PA/ET may be analogous to a drug, with indications and contraindications as well as issues related to underdosing and overdosing ( 27 ). The recent running articles certainly raise the idea that running doses of less than the PA guidelines may produce maximal protection from all-cause and CV mortality ( 15,36 ). On the other hand, very high doses of ET could have adverse effects by increasing the risk of arrhythmias (especially VA and AF) but also with acute bouts of high-volume, high-intensity ET increasing release of troponin and BNP and causing acute cardiac dilation and dysfunction of cardiac chambers. Returning to high bouts of ET before cardiac recovery could prove to be particularly toxic to the heart. Chronic EEE can produce myocardial scarring and potentially produce cardiomyopathies and substrate for sustained and life-threatening VA. The Other Side of the Story — Providing Fair Balance Others feel that the evidence that years of high-intensity ET accelerates atherosclerosis or causes cardiac fibrosis is relatively weak, and given the known benefits of competitive ET, discussed previously, on both cardiac and vascular structure and function, this may not be clinically important ( 4,16,17 ). Although there is no argument that EEE can be potentially harmful, it may be inappropriate to overly frighten individuals who want to participate in competitive ET, even EEE, such as marathons, triathlons, or even ultraendurance races ( 16 ). In fact, very high levels of ET may prevent the decreased compliance and dispensability observed with healthy, sedentary aging ( 4,17 ). Summary and Conclusions On the basis of multiple studies, it would seem most advisable, at least from a population-wide public health standpoint, to limit vigorous ET to no more than 60 min·d −1 , and indeed it is likely that near-maximal health benefits occur at even much lower doses ( 15,27,36 ). On the other hand, people participate in vigorous ET for non-health reasons, including competition/challenge, fun/exhilaration, ego, psychological benefits, friendships, etc. These individuals should recognize that there may be some increased risk, although relatively small, of such vigorous EEE. Ideally, however, a weekly cumulative dose of vigorous ET of not more than 5 h may be ideal, including taking 1 to 2 d·wk −1 off from vigorous and high-intensity ET ( 27 ). Finally as Hippocrates noted centuries ago, “If we could give every individual the right amount of nourishment and exercise, not too little and not too much, we would have found the safest way to health” ( 9 ). These words from 2,500 years ago still seem prudent and wise today. The authors declare no conflicts of interest and do not have any financial disclosures. References 1.  Abdulla J, Nielsen JR.

Ergonomic advice on lifting technique and sitting posture has been ineffective in preventing MSDs. Through a series of studies conducted over 15 years, the National Research Centre for the Working Environment in Denmark has developed and documented the effectiveness of micro-exercise for MSDs across a range of job groups. Micro-exercise refers to brief and manageable bouts of efficient physical exercise that can easily be integrated into the workday, such as strength training with an elastic band. The national communication campaign, ‘Job & Body,’ promoted these exercises across Denmark. National surveillance of the working environment shows a notable increase in workers offered micro-exercise at their workplace, from 15.2\u202f% in 2012 to 25.2\u202f% in 2023. This societal impact reflects the success of continuously refining research to meet workplace needs and overcoming practical, ideological, and cultural barriers. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords Occupational health Health promotion Chronic diseases Musculoskeletal diseases Physical activity Social impact Musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs), encompassing a wide range of conditions such as low back pain, neck pain and osteoarthritis, have a major negative social impact causing pain and suffering worldwide. The Global Burden of Disease Study shows that low back pain has remained the global leading cause of disability since 1990, while neck and other MSDs have ranged between the 8th and 12th leading causes [1] . In a workplace context, these disorders negatively affect work ability, increasing the risk of sickness absence and early retirement. Various factors, including occupational activities, lifestyle, and genetic predispositions, contribute to the development, worsening and persistence of MSDs. Work-related MSDs are particularly prevalent among workers having repetitive tasks, performing heavy lifting, or maintaining awkward postures for extended periods. In the latter decades of the 20th century, sedentary work became more widespread. From an ergonomic perspective, the work tasks were often repetitive and monotonous, such as extensive keyboard typing, leading to long hours spent seated in front of computers. Consequently, computer workers began to complain about pain and stiffness in the neck and shoulders. Simultaneously, many workers were still engaged in physically demanding jobs, making MSDs a widespread issue across both sedentary and physically intense labor. To manage these work-related challenges, many ergonomic interventions focused on providing guidance on proper lifting techniques for workers with manual material handling or patient handling and advices on correct sitting postures for workers in sedentary occupations. Despite these efforts, ergonomic advices on how to lift and sit proved largely ineffective and MSDs remained a major challenge for workplaces and societies [2] . Advice on performing stretching exercises for preventing and managing MSDs, e.g. for the neck and shoulders following extended periods of sedentary work, was also common in the beginning of 2000. By contrast, health professionals often cautioned against high-intensity exercises, such as strength training, due to the concern that they might exacerbate neck and shoulder tension and pain. This belief was challenged in the early 2000s by two landmark studies from Finland and Sweden demonstrating beneficial effects of active exercises, including endurance and strength training, on neck and shoulder pain [3] , [4] . Despite their effectiveness, these comprehensive exercise programs were performed in gyms [3] and rehabilitation centers [4] , requiring considerable individual effort and time away from work. Many workers would therefore refrain from participating in such exercise rehabilitation programs. Thus, the development of workplace-friendly exercise programs was an opportunity for the research to have a reasonable possibility for creating a societal impact. This article describes how the National Research Centre for the Working Environment (NFA) in Denmark developed and implemented micro-exercises for MSDs through research studies and a national campaign, leading to gradual adoption by workplaces across the country. Micro-exercise refers to brief and manageable bouts of efficient physical exercise that can easily be integrated into the workday, such as strength training with an elastic band. Methodology We used a combination of different methods and study designs: 1. Laboratory studies with technical measurements. For example, electromyography measurements during different micro-exercises with heavy dumbbells versus elastic bands [5] . 2. Randomized controlled trials at workplaces. For example, testing strength training versus general fitness training for pain in the neck and shoulders [6] , and comparing the dose-response effect of elastic band training for pain in the neck and shoulders [7] . 3. Designing and performing a national campaign. For example, the 'Job & Body' campaign to promote micro-exercise and the collective responsibility in managing MSDs at the workplace [8] . 4. Surveys and register follow-up in representative samples of workers in Denmark. For example, repeated random samples of employees in the public sector to monitor the impact of the 'Job & Body' campaign over time [8] , and repeated random samples of workers from the general working population to track adoption of micro-exercise at workplaces over the years and to evaluate its potential impact on sickness absence [9] . Thus, our approach progressed through several phases. Laboratory studies using electromyography compared exercise types and equipment to develop feasible workplace exercises. Workplace trials then tested effectiveness through randomized controlled studies, identifying implementation barriers and gathering worker feedback. Stakeholder engagement involved consulting employers, unions, and worker representatives. The national campaign included networking, workplace tours, and mass media communication, with trained local champions supporting implementation. Throughout, we monitored adoption rates and sickness absence through surveys and register follow-up, enabling continuous refinement of exercises and implementation strategies based on real-world outcomes. Thus, the series of studies were interconnected, evolving based on the insights and results from previous research, along with feedback and ongoing dialogue with participating workplaces and stakeholders at various levels. Results and implications In 2005, NFA aimed to develop feasible and effective exercise programs that could easily be integrated into the workplace. The main criteria were that the exercises should be of 1) high intensity, 2) feasible to perform at the workplaces, and 3) not require too much time away from the work tasks. By high intensity, we mean exercises performed with a relatively high resistance (using tools like elastic bands or dumbbells) that challenge and strengthen the muscles, as opposed to light movements like stretching or simple arm raises. The third criteria proved to be the most difficult, but finally the participating workplaces agreed that workers could spend up to one weekly hour on the exercises during the experimental period. In a pivotal study from 2008, we demonstrated that high-intensity strength training for 3\u202f×\u202f20\u202fmin per week was much more effective for work-related chronic neck and shoulder pain than general fitness training for 3\u202f×\u202f20\u202fmin per week or receiving advices on workplace ergonomics, diet, health, relaxation, and stress management for one hour per week [6] . Despite the clear documentation for the benefits of strength training at the workplace for MSDs, we subsequently met several practical, ideological and cultural barriers for the uptake at workplaces: 1. From a practical standpoint, the program required one hour per week away from work duties, a lot of heavy weights (i.e. dumbbells), and a dedicated space for the exercises, such as an empty office or a hallway. 2. Both employers and labor unions exhibited ideological founded resistance against strength training at the workplace. Employers questioned the appropriateness of being responsible for and paying for an hour of weekly exercise, and argued that workers should rather be encouraged to do exercise during leisure. Labor unions argued that focus should be on improving conditions in the work environment to prevent MSDs, rather than shifting the emphasis to individual workers undertaking strength training, which could inadvertently transfer the burden of responsibility from the workplace to the individual. 3. Certain cultural barriers and a lack of social acceptability also existed among workers. Many understood strength training with heavy weight as a leisure activity for muscular people sweating in a gym and not something to be done with colleagues at the workplace. To overcome these barriers, we first set out to simplify the strength training program, while maintaining its effectiveness. Returning to the laboratory from the workplace, we demonstrated in 2010 with technical measurements of muscle activity (electromyography) that high-intensity strength exercises could efficiently be performed with elastic resistance bands instead of dumbbells [5] . This removed the obstacle of requiring heavy weights and ample space for their accommodation. We then performed a randomized controlled workplace study with elastic bands to determine ‘how little strength training is enough?’ In the study published in 2011, we demonstrated that pain in the neck and shoulders could be effectively reduced through just two minutes of daily elastic band strength training when performed until muscular fatigue [7] . This eliminated the time barrier for exercising during working hours and provided the opportunity for exercises to be performed anywhere at the workplace, as the elastic bands were easy to carry around. We also realized that words matter as they create mental images. In relation to the word ‘strength training’, such images are often stereotypically associated with heavy weights, people sweating, bulky muscles and crowded gyms. This came to our realization in the initial research studies, as the close contact with the participating workplaces resulted in many daily small-talks between the researchers and workers, e.g. when supervising the strength training sessions at the workplaces. Around 2011, we therefore gradually changed the rhetoric from ‘strength training’ to using words like ‘elastic band exercises’, ‘small daily exercises’ and ‘micro-exercise’, emphasizing brief, manageable physical exercise bouts that could effortlessly blend into the workday. This rhetorical approach aimed to normalize strength training at the workplace, making it more culturally acceptable and feasible. Together, these efforts resulted in the simple message that two minutes of micro-exercise per day performed together with colleagues at the workplace can help alleviate MSDs. In 2011, the Danish Working Environment Information Centre launched the national 'Job & Body' campaign [8] . This multifaceted campaign running from 2011 to 2014 included networking activities, the deployment of a dedicated communication team, a nationwide campaign-tour targeting public workplaces, and a comprehensive mass media campaign. Central to the campaign messaging was the encouragement for workers to maintain physically activity despite experiencing pain in the body and that managing MSDs is a collective responsibility at the workplace. Importantly, the campaign adopted the micro-exercises developed in the research studies. The campaign emphasized complementary roles in MSD prevention - employers provide proper working conditions and facilitate micro-exercise opportunities, while employees actively participate in available programs. This balanced approach creates shared ownership rather than shifting responsibility to either party alone, leading to better implementation and sustainability of workplace initiatives.

One of the posters from the national campaign ‘Job & Body’. This poster shows four micro-exercises with elastic bands to strengthen the muscles of the neck, shoulder and forearm. The overall experiences from the campaign and research studies were that successful long-term implementation requires dedicated exercise time during work hours, brief exercise programs, social support through collective exercise, local ambassadors, regular refresher training, and consistent management support. Using random samples of public employees replying to questionnaires through 2011–2014, we evaluated the national impact of the campaign. Results showed that the campaign led to more positive beliefs in Denmark about MSDs, physical activity and work, e.g. the importance of staying active despite of pain and that managing MSDs is a shared responsibility at the workplace [8] . The research and the campaign activities have initiated a number of knowledge mobilization processes external to NFA. Several examples have emerged showing that various actors have adopted the knowledge, adapted it to their own needs, and disseminated it within their own ranks. Some notable examples are: 1. In 2016, the Municipality of Copenhagen introduced physical exercise during working hours for all employees in nursing homes and in home care after learning about NFA's research and the Job & Body campaign. The initiative has meant that 6000 employees at Copenhagen's 42 care homes and 5 care units do physical exercise for about 35\u2009min a week. In 2020, they received the Working Environment Award for their efforts. 2. The meat industry's working environment committee has developed and adapted materials and exercises for their target groups. 3. Two industrial knowledge broker organizations (BFA’s), The Danish Sector Working Environment Council Welfare & Public Administration and The Sector Working Environment Committee for Retailing, have embraced the results and developed their own material based on the material from NFA. 4. The Danish Working Environment Authority promotes the Job & Body material on their website, including posters with the micro-exercises. Through national surveillance of the work environment, we have since 2012 evaluated the time-wise adoption of micro-exercise in the general working population of Denmark. During the years 2012–2018 (Work Environment and Health in Denmark Study), the percentage of workers offered micro-exercise at the workplace increased from 15.2\u2009% in 2012 to 21.7\u2009% in 2018. In 2021, this increased further to 25.7\u2009%, and were maintained at about the same level (25.2\u2009%) in 2023 (National Surveillance of the Work Environment of Employees in Denmark). Additionally, the uptake of micro-exercise (percentage of workers using the offer among those being offered) increased from 54.3\u2009% to 61.0\u2009% between 2012 and 2018 (not shown in the figure) [9] .

Timeline of important activities and impact in terms of percentage of workers in the general working population offered micro-exercise at the workplace through the years. A number of studies from different research groups have subsequently validated the positive results of micro-exercise for MSDs across a range of different job groups and in different countries, also among workers in physically demanding jobs [2] , [10] . Furthermore, in a cohort study with 70,130 workers of the general working population and a two-year register follow-up, we found that implementation of micro-exercise at all workplaces in Denmark could potentially prevent 12.8\u2009% of all long-term sickness absence cases [9] . Considering that only one in four workers of the general working population today have the possibility for micro-exercise at the workplace, the potential for further societal impact is enormous. In conclusion, the societal impact of micro-exercise for MSDs in Denmark comes from a multifaceted, broad dissemination of activities and the continuous adaption of the research questions to needs and recommendations to fit the workplace demands and overcome practical, ideological, and cultural barriers.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the impact of an Active Breaks workplace program based on Bandura’s Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) aligned with Behavior Change Techniques (BCT) on PA levels, cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), WA, and social relationships among university workers. METHODS: #UCLMuévete is a quasi-experimental, 12-week intervention designed according to the TREND and TIDieR-PHP checklists. Sixty-nine university workers were recruited and placed into 17 teams of 3 to 5 people. Participants were instructed to take a 20-min active break every working day (walking, cycling, and functional training). The following variables were measured before and after the 12-week intervention: (1) Amount of PA with accelerometers, (2) CRF through the 6 Min-Walking Test (m), (3) Body composition (fat mass (gr), muscle mass (gr), and bone mineral content (g/cm3) through densitometry), (4) Stress with the BodyGuard2 device, (5) WA through Work Ability Index (WAI), and (6) Social relationships through an ad-hoc questionnaire. Part-time workers, pregnant women, and workers with physical disability were excluded. RESULTS: Significant improvements were observed in the amount of daily moderate-to-vigorous PA (Difference (Dif)., women +8.05 and men +12.31 minutes; p <\u200a0.05; ES\u200a=\u200a0.224; 0.379), CRF (Dif., women +52.98 and men +25.53 meters; p <\u200a0.05; ES\u200a=\u200a0.578; 0.209), and (Dif., women +2.16 and men +2.39; p <\u200a0.05; ES = 0.150; 0.177). No significant changes were observed in body composition and stress. CONCLUSION: 20\u200amin/day of aerobic and strength active breaks, based on SCT aligned to BCTs, improves university workers’ amount of PA, CRF, WAI, and social relationships. 1 Introduction Evidence suggests that workplace wellness programs based on physical activity (WWPPA) are effective in reducing non-communicable diseases and WA of workers that occur as a result of an increase of physical inactivity among workers [ 1 – 3 ]. Furthermore, WWPPA are also associated with improvements in mental health if the delivered physical activity (PA) includes socially connecting with others [ 4 , 5 ]. For these reasons, international organizations such as the WHO [ 6 ] encourage the implementation of WWPPA in occupational environments. Despite this strong evidence in favor of WWPPA, widespread application in workplaces is yet to be achieved [ 4 ]. This is the case on university campuses, where few studies have been reported [ 7 ], even though many university workers accumulate long periods of sitting time, are physically inactive, and/or report high body mass index [ 8 ]. Meanwhile, factors such as strict deadlines, overwork or communication problems with colleagues and superiors may lead to considerable mental stress that enhance psychological risks [ 9 ]. Therefore, further attempts to introduce WWPPA among university workers are needed [ 10 ]. One reason for the lack of WWPPA programs on university campuses is that designing these programs is complex (e.g., timing, target population, intervention settings, etc.), especially if it requires restructuring the physical environment or if university workers are spread across several physical locations [ 11 ]. The current wave of literature suggests structural changes in the work environment (e.g., standing desks, active workstations) [ 12 ] and the use of active breaks (e.g., 10-20\u200amin break within the workday to do some resistance, strength, stretching, etc., structured or semi-structured PA) or full structured-PA sessions of 45–60\u200amin (e.g., biking or yoga) are beneficial to promote healthier habits in workers [ 3 ]. Some attempts using the full structured-PA session approach has been applied to university workers with promising results on increasing their PA level and health through aerobic (cardiorespiratory endurance) or anaerobic (muscle strengthening resistance) exercises [ 13 ]. However, the PA duration (≥45\u200amin), the required materials, resources, and the used facilities are barriers to replicate the approach in other universities and to achieve high adherence-level to the implemented programs [ 11 ]. Active breaks might overcome these barriers as the PA timing session is much shorter (≈10–20\u200amin), can be designed to use minimal or null fitness equipment (e.g., back exercises), and worker can have the flexibility of doing the brake anytime along the workday [ 14 ]. As a health promotion intervention, WWPPAs can be designed using behavior change theories such as the Bandura’s Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) [ 15 ] aligned to Behavior Change Techniques (BCTs) which are the active components that aim to bring about change [ 16 ]. Several studies have examined the effectiveness of SCT in increasing adherence [ 17 ] and the quality of social environments [ 18 ]. Whereas the use of technological advances (i.e., mHealth) combined with the SCT constructs can drive greater impact in workers’ habits [ 19 ]. However, to date no intervention targeting university workers has used mHealth tools or the SCT aligned with BCTs (e.g., goal setting, action planning, feedback on outcomes of behavior, self-monitoring and social comparison) to increase WWPPAs effectiveness by delivering BCTs [ 20 ]. Smart offices are another option to promote PA among workers by visualizing activity status, reminders, summaries, and exercise suggestions [ 21 ], but this technology is still to be implemented in Spanish public universities. Thereby, the aim of this study was to analyse the impact of a WWPPA, a program which includes 20 minutes of active breaks, on the amount of PA, cardiorespiratory fitness level (CRF), work-ability index (WAI) and social relationships on university workers. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Design This is a quasi-experimental study conducted among a single group of university workers with pre-post measures, between September and December 2021. The protocol received approval from the Clinical Research Ethics Committee of the University Health Service, Spain based on the latest version of the Declaration of Helsinki (Ref.: 742/01072021). Written informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to data collection. 2.2 Participants 69 workers, either faculty or university staff on the same campus, were recruited for the study. From this total, 61 workers finished the program, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, two participants were unable to complete post-test measures. The final sample was composed of 59 workers of UCLM ( n =\u200a39 female; n =\u200a20 male; 24–55 years). The primary inclusion criteria required the individuals to participate in teams as social interaction was one of the BCTs applied. Accordingly, they signed up as teams of 3 to 5 people. A total of 17 teams participated in the program. This decision was made based on previous studies have reported that teams increase adherence to WWPPA by increasing the intrinsic motivation and attitude toward the intervention [ 22 ]. The members of these teams did not necessarily have to belong to the same job position. Volunteers working less than 6 hours/day, part time workers, pregnant women, and workers with physical impediment that prevents or discourages the practice of PA were excluded from the study. 2.3 Study timeline During the recruitment and enrollment phase, a media campaign of the project, and material was distributed by e-mail, newspaper, social media, and posters throughout the university campus. Interested workers completed a questionnaire and signed up in teams. Once all the teams were enrolled, the research team met with the participants in person to explain the study, answer questions, and review and sign the informed consent. UCLMuevete intervention spanned 12 weeks. The principal investigator completed the baseline and 12-week post-intervention data collection (see Fig. 1 ). Fig. 1 Flow diagram phases of UCLMuevete. Open in viewer 2.4 Intervention The PA intervention was designed to assist the workers in achieving the current PA guidelines for adults recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) [ 6 ], consisting of 20-min sessions of both moderate to vigorous aerobic (cardiorespiratory endurance) and anaerobic (muscle strengthening resistance) PA, 5-days/week for a period of 10-weeks. Participants were instructed to complete one session per day during the working day and encouraged to do a minimum of 3 sessions per week. For each session, participants could choose any space in Campus University for partaking the active break and could use the campus sports facilities (gym, bicycle and walking path). A detailed breakdown of UCLMuevete project is provided in Supplementary file 1 according to the TREND and TIDieR-PHP checklists [ 23 ]. The intervention was tailored according to Bandura’s Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) because it is one of the most widely used theories for tailoring wellness programs. This theory suggests that individuals’ behavior is regulated through reinforcement (internal and external social reinforcement, social influences and past experiences) and control (self-efficacy) [ 15 ]. Moreover, the main construct of this theory, self-efficacy, defined as the belief in one’s capabilities to execute the desired behavior, has been associated with increasing the effectiveness of PA interventions [ 24 ]. Following the previous studies’ recommendations, the intervention was designed using the behavior change techniques taxonomy 1 (BCTs) [ 25 ]. (see Supplementary Table 1). 2.4.1 Mobile app –Apptivados- wereables –mHealth As part of the project, a Mobile App “Apptivados” was developed with four sections: a) news, b) personal trainer, c) nutrition, and d) challenges. In section a) news, participants received a daily notification about the exercise they should do and a motivational message. In addition, participants could interact through this section, replying to each other in comments and likes. In section b) personal trainer, participants had access to an agenda with the five active breaks of the week, and the participants could choose the active break to perform. This session included exercise descriptions, recommendations, times, repetitions, muscles involved, and instructional videos. In section c) nutrition, participants received weekly posts on nutritional aspects such as food properties or healthy food recommendations for the workplace. In section d) challenges, the rankings and points of the different teams were published. In addition, all participants were supervised by an activity bracelet model Xiaomi Mi Band 4, which has been validated in other studies with similar purposes, to record their daily activity such as total time, number of steps, and heart rate [ 26 ]. 2.4.2 Challenges The intervention was delivered to each team in form of three challenges. The challenge achievement resulted into points and rewards (fruit, restaurant gift cards, and t-shirts). Challenge 1-“ Camino de Santiago by bicycle ”: aerobic exercise, that required participants to pedal for at least 20 minutes, simulating a stage of the Camino de Santiago Road. Challenge 2-“ Get to know the Fábrica de Armas Campus ”: aerobic exercise, consisted of a 20-minute walk around the university campus. Challenge 3-“ Be strong ”: strength exercises, a set of 4 strength exercises involving major muscle groups. These three challenges were alternated each week, so the participant completed three aerobic sessions and two strength sessions (e.g., 3 sessions of walking and 2 of strength). The session volume increased weekly, and participants were asked to complete the sessions at the highest intensity possible to ensure they performed vigorous PA. Rankings resulting from challenges were based on three criteria: (1) days of participation per week; (2) the total invested time of the active pause (which could oscillate between 15 and 20\u200amin per day); and (3) the average heart rate or steps recorded. Daily activity, heart rate and steps were registered using an activity bracelet Xiaomi Mi Band 4 [ 26 ]. 2.4.3 Social media To promote participant engagement, interaction, and motivation, a marketing campaign was developed through the @uclmuevete accounts on Instagram, Twitter, Youtube, and email. Daily goals photos and videos were published on the social media accounts and in the app. 2.5 Data collection Two data collection periods were established: baseline and after the 12 weeks’ intervention. The first measurement included two questionnaires (the WAI and Ad-hoc questionnaire) a physical health assessment (densitometry, body composition, and CRF), the use of a Bodyguard 2 device for 48 hours (for Heart Rate Variability (HRV) registration, stress and relax) and an accelerometer for five days (for PA levels). The data were collected in the laboratory of the research group. 2.5.1 Questionnaires Participants were asked to complete two questionnaires: The Work Ability Index (WAI) and an ad-hoc questionnaire. The questionnaires were administered on paper. 2.5.2 Work-Ability Index (WAI) The WAI is a questionnaire used to assess the WA of workers [ 27 ]. The index is determined from answers to a series of questions, which consider job demands, workers’ health status and resources. The questionnaire contains 10 questions and 7 dimensions ranging from 7 to 49, with higher values indicating better WA. The results are classified into four groups: –weak (7-27) –average (28-36) –good (37-43) –excellent (44-49) [ 28 ]. 2.5.3 Ad-hoc questionnaire The following questions were formulated at the end of the intervention participants were asked the following questions: 1) Do you consider that the relationship with your teammates has improved after participating in UCLMuevete? With categorical answer: Yes; no; 2) After the program, do you consider that social relations with the rest of the teams have improved? Yes; no; 3) Do you consider that taking active breaks has been a motivating factor in your daily working life? With dichotomous answers yes or no; and 4) Do you consider that you have suffered stress as a result of the active breaks? With dichotomous answers yes or no. 2.5.4 Physical health assessment a. Densitometry and body composition Bone mass (BMC; in g) and bone mineral density (BMD; in g/cm 2 ), fat mass (g) and muscle mass (g) were calculated using DXA (Hologic Series Discovery QDR, Physician’s Viewer Software, APEX System Software Version 3.1.2., Bedford, MA, USA), following the DXA best practice guidelines described previously [ 29 ]. Before any measurements, the DXA was calibrated each day with phantoms, as per the manufacturer’s guidelines. The participants were in a supine position with their hands level with their hips and their feet slightly apart. All DXA scans, completed with the same device and software, were performed by certified and trained DXA technicians who positioned the participants, performed the scan, and executed the analysis following research facility standard operating procedures. All scans were analyzed using the software auto-analysis feature, followed by manually correcting analysis markers when necessary to avoid measurement errors. Total body and regional analyses were performed in a routine clinical manner. Fat mass was obtained from the sum of the lean soft tissue mass and bone mineral content and was calculated from whole-body scans excluding the head. The fat mass coefficient of variation for repeated measures was <\u200a3.3% [ 29 ]. b. Cardiorespiratory fitness capacity The six-minute walk test (6MWT) is a widely used measure of exercise capacity in many conditions affecting young adults. The 6MWT tests were performed following American Thoracic Society guidelines, and subjects were instructed to walk from end to end 30\u200am with signs every 3\u200am marked with a cone, at their own pace, while attempting to cover as much ground as possible in the allotted 6 minutes [ 30 ]. Technicians encouraged subjects with the standardized phrases “You’re doing good” or “Keep it up.” Subjects were allowed to stop and rest during the test, but were instructed to resume walking as soon as they felt able to do so. The 6MWT present the values in meters and it classified the participant according to their CRF percentile: very low (<5th), low (5th to 25th), regular (26th to 50th), good (51th to 75th), excellent (76th to 95th) and superior (>95th) [ 31 ]. c. BodyGuard 2 device. HRV, stress and recovery HRV measurement refers to the measured heartbeat-to-heartbeat intervals, and through this parameter the amount and intensity of PA, stress and recovery can be determined. Using the Firstbeat BodyGuard 2 device, the heartbeats recorded during two working days are analyzed to determine the stress and recovery load of the participants (Firstbeat Technologies Ltd., Jyväskylä, Finland, 2014). For this purpose, the subject had to place the device on their chest. This information was downloaded into the Firstbeat SPORTS software (version 4.7.2.1). The validity of the device has been demonstrated in other investigations, being considered accurate for monitoring HRV [ 32 ]. d. Accelerometry The MOX1 is a validated accelerometer-based activity recording device that measures high-resolution raw acceleration data for up to 5 days [ 33 ]. Using the IDEEQ software, objective measurements of PA can be classified and quantified. It provides information on: (1) Accelerometer raw data (x, y, z); (2) Posture detection (sedentary (lying/sitting) or standing); (3) PA intensity (counts per minute); and (4) PA classification (low, medium and high intensity). The subject attached the sensor to the upper leg with a biocompatible adhesive [ 33 ]. 2.6 Outcomes The primary criteria for determining intervention efficacy were the changes in the amount of PA (minutes). Using accelerometer data, the sitting time, standing time, and low, moderate and/or vigorous PA (MPA; VPA; MVPA) have been analyzed. Secondary outcomes include WA, CRF (based on distance), body composition (fat mass, muscle mass, body weight and bone mineral density), stress level and social relationships. These secondary outcomes were chosen to understand the underlying mechanisms/processes by which the overall health improve. 2.7 Data analysis Data were analyzed using SPSS version 25.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). A repeated-measures ANCOVA test was used to compare intergroup mean differences. A p -value less than 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance. The analysis was divided by women and men, repeating the same tests by corresponding genders. The assumption of a normal distribution of the dependent variables in the group was checked. The effect size (ES), a measure of the magnitude of change, was calculated using Eta squared (η 2 ). ES was assessed using the following criteria: 0–0.1\u200a=\u200alow, 0.1–0.6\u200a=\u200amedium, >0.14\u200a=\u200ahigh [ 34 ]. Continuous data were presented in terms of mean±SD. The categorical data were presented in terms of frequencies and percentages. 3 Results Descriptive data is displayed in Table\xa01 : Statistical scores of body composition, accelerometry, stress, WA and 6 MWT in women before and after the intervention and Table\xa02 .

Sedentary time decreased in the post-measure ( p <\u200a0.05; women -27.76±13.29 and men -65.14±27.67 minutes), while improvements after intervention were found for MVPA ( p < 0.05; women +16.10±4.99 and men 24.64±7.40 minutes), VPA variables ( p < 0.05; women 15.83±3.03 and men 17.04±5.45 minutes), WAI (women +2.16±0.83 and men +2.39±1.18) and 6MWT ( p < 0.05; women +52.98±7.34 and men +25.53±11.38 meters). All differences showed moderate to high effect sizes (between 0.103 and 0.578). Finally, a decreased in relax was displayed in men (stress variable) ( p <\u200a0.05; -11.32±3.83%).

Open in viewer Before the intervention 69.23% and 80% of women and men performed more than 300\u200amin of MPA per week. After the intervention an increase of 2.56% were observed in MPA in women, while no changes were observed in men. On the other hand, an increase of 30.77% and 15% in women and men performing more than 150 minutes of VPA per week was observed after the intervention. Concerning the classification of 6MWT by percentile, the number of women increase in the excellent (76th to 95th) and superior (>95th) categories ( n =+4; n =+2), while the low and regular (26th to 50th) decreased ( n =-3; n =-3). Regarding men, an increase was observed in the excellent category (76th to 95th) ( n =+3) and a decrease in the low (<5th) ( n =-3). Regarding WAI, all categories: weak, average, good, and excellent described improvements after the intervention. In the case of women, a decrease in the average and good categories ( n =-3; n =\u200a-4) and an increase in the excellent group ( n =+7) were observed. In men, the average and good categories decreased ( n =-3; n =\u200a-2), while the excellent category increased ( n =+5). Finally, according to the results measured by the ad-hoc questionnaire on social relationship, 1) 70.3% of participants considered that the relationship with their teammates (belonging to the same team) improved after the intervention, 2) 74.8% of participants felt that social relations with other colleagues of UCLMuevete also improve after the intervention, 3) 96.4% of participants said that taking active breaks was a motivating factor in their daily work life, and 4) 37.5% considered that suffered stress as a result of active breaks. 4 Discussion This is the first intervention in university workers that promotes physical exercise and impacts on the social relationship through a WWPPA which include active breaks based on Bandura’s Social Cognitive Theory of Self-Regulation aligned to Behavior Change Techniques, using mHealth as a tool to promote adherence to the practice. The results show an improvement in the amount of daily PA, WA, CRF, social relationship, and high adherence in women and men. One of the main findings of this study is that participating in short-active breaks at the worksite that includes strength and aerobic exercise contributes to increasing the average daily MVPA engagement of workers in both women (16.10±4.99\u200amin) and or men (24.64±7.40\u200amin). This confirms that university campuses present opportunities to target healthy behaviors such as PA [ 35 ], as well as active breaks in the workplace are effective to increase daily PA levels of workers. Moreover, the increase of the average daily MVPA engagement due to active breaks substituting sitting behavior is associated with lower all-cause, CVD and cancer mortality risk (3). In addition, the increase of women who surpassed the threshold of 150\u200amin of VPA by 30.77% suggests that interventions based on active breaks in worksites are effective tools to target the gender gap in PA reported in previous studies [ 36 ] and the fact women usually report lower engagement in VPA [ 37 ]. Sedentary behavior in the workplace is frequently targeted in health-related interventions at the workplace because of its association with non-communicable diseases and premature death [ 38 ]. Even if this behavior was not targeted in the UCLMuevete, the outcomes from accelerometers suggest that the 20\u200amin break intervention at the workplace contributed to decrease the average daily sedentary time over 40 minutes (women -43.14\u200amin; men -65.14\u200amin). These findings might mean that participants substituted some sedentary behavior for light-to-MVPA not only at the workplace, but also in their time off work. Future studies should explore this further to confirm these findings and the nature of the changes in sedentary behavior in time off work. On the other hand, this intervention aimed to increase the CRF of participants as a result of their participation in active breaks as higher cardiorespiratory fitness is associated with lower risk of cardiovascular diseases [ 31 , 39 ]. Even if the goal standard test for measuring CRF was not used, the outcomes from 6MWT distance to estimate participants’ CRF has been reported to be reliable enough in the general population and permits measuring CRF of workers in an easy and fast way so can be implemented in real interventions at the workplace. The outcomes from the UCLMuevete suggest that WWPPA with 20\u200amin of active breaks based on strength and endurance exercise not only increases the average CRF levels, but also helped several participants to move from the initial CRF stage to higher stages, including the 5 people who initially reported low CRF ( n =\u200a5), so, although further research is needed, just 20-min break at the workplace might reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases. According to previous studies, 30\u200amin to 40\u200amin of PA intervention at the workplace can improve the WA [ 40 , 41 ], which might contribute to decrease absenteeism [ 42 ]. The UCLMuevete program indicates that 20-min break can also improve the WA, as those participants with low WA at baseline displayed a considerable improvement after the intervention. However, these findings are limited by (a) the high average WA reported in baseline and (b) the fact of this project’s methodology does not permit to set cause-effect because we could not conduct a follow up; so further research is needed in this regard. The relax variable was significantly affected by the intervention in men. Therefore, contrary to other authors [ 43 ], the increase in PA at work may not lead to significant improvements in stress levels measured objectively. According to the ad-hoc questionnaire completed after the intervention, the lack of improvement in the stress level in men may be attributed to the fact that 37% of workers reported suffering stress during the intervention; being the non-stop high mental workload, frequent interruptions during work, and unfinished tasks [ 44 ]. Nonetheless, stress is a multicomponent construct that fluctuates over time [ 45 ]. Therefore, conducting multiple stress measurements throughout the intervention could enhance our understanding of how stress is affected by environmental fluctuations [ 45 ]. Changes in body composition are strongly influenced by dietary habits, PA, and/or sedentary time [ 46 ]. Thus, although dietary habits were not controlled, the increase in PA and the decrease in sedentary time led us to expect improvements in participant’s body composition [ 46 ], but this hypothesis was not fulfilled in the study. The possible reasons are (a) the short duration of the intervention (12 weeks), (b) the length of active breaks (20 minutes), and (c) the fact post-intervention measurements coincided with the week before Christmas day and many participants reported to increase social events and food intakes [ 47 , 48 ]. One of the topics of interest to researchers is identifying the factors necessary to increase adherence to PA programs in order to achieve long-term effects [ 49 ]. According to Bourne and colleagues [ 25 ], behavior change theories might increase effectiveness of interventions at the workplace, although a misguided application of this theory has been reported in previously [ 37 ]. To reduce the risk of misuse, and also, facilitate future comparisons [ 16 ] the intervention was designed considering only those BCTs that match with Bandura’s SCT [ 15 ]. On the other hand, we could not test the effect of the intervention in comparison to a control group. However, the 88.40% of adherence and the improvement in social relationships and motivation of the participants after the intervention are in line with other researchers which suggest SCT-aligned BCTs and integrated in mHealth are effective to promote behavior change in PA, motivation, adherence, and social relationship [ 25 , 51 ]. Finally, it would have been interesting to measure the effect of the intervention on musculoskeletal disorders, which are considered a common pathology among office workers [ 52 ]. Moreover, other studies have demonstrated that taking active breaks of 10-20 minutes could have a positive impact on musculoskeletal disorders [ 52 ]. Therefore, we will consider musculoskeletal disorders as a measurement variable in future research. 5 Conclusions Implementing a PA program through active breaks of 20 minutes, including aerobic and strength exercise, at least three times per week is beneficial for increasing the MVPA, decreasing sedentary levels, and improving either workers’ health or WA. Moreover, underpinning PA interventions with the SCT-aligned BCTs seem to be effective for achieving high adherence, motivation, and social relationships of workers.

In the present study, we further examined the effectiveness of a daily routine involving ingestion of HPS 3 h after a basal meal and subsequent light resistance exercise (dumbbell exercise) in increasing the mass and strength of human muscle. Ten young adult males were subject to the following 3 conditions for 5 wk each, with sufficient recovery period between each condition: (1) Snack-Exercise (SE), (2) Snack-Sedentary (SS), and (3) No snack-Exercise (NE). The SE group showed a significant increase in lean body mass and total cross-sectional area (CSA) of the right forearm muscles along with a significant decrease in body fat mass. The SS group showed no change in body composition. Furthermore, the SE group showed significant increase in grip strength and isometric knee extensor muscle strength, while the SS group showed no increase in muscle strength. The NE group showed significant increase in grip strength. In conclusion, daily routine ingestion of HPS 3 h after a basal meal and subsequent light resistance exercise is effective in increasing the mass and strength of human muscle. 引用文献 (30) 関連文献 (0) 図 (0) 著者関連情報 電子付録 (0) 成果一覧 () 被引用文献 (10) © \t2011 by the Center for Academic Publications Japan 前の記事 次の記事 お気に入り & アラート お気に入りに追加 追加情報アラート 被引用アラート 認証解除アラート 関連記事 閲覧履歴 前身誌 THE JOURNAL OF VITAMINOLOGY このページを共有する feedback Top J-STAGEへの登録はこちら（無料） 登録 すでにアカウントをお持ちの場合\u3000サインインは こちら'}"
The affective and behavioral responses to repeated “strength snacks”,"['SL Buckner', 'SJ Dankel', 'KT Mattocks']",2018,a strength test twice a week (1RM) and the other group performed traditional “hypertrophy”   (10) demonstrated that the performance of brief intense “exercise snacks” (six 1-min work,10,https://akjournals.com/view/journals/2060/105/2/article-p188.xml,"{'Title': 'Share Link', 'Authors': 'No Authors Found', 'Abstract': 'Background A training program consisting of only one-repetition maximum (1RM) training results in similar strength adaptations as traditional resistance exercise. However, little is known regarding the affective or behavioral responses to this type of training. Aim To examine the affective and behavioral response to either a traditional resistance exercise program or a biweekly 1RM-training program. Methods Participants were trained for 8 weeks (2× per week). The HYPER group completed four sets of 8–12 repetitions; the 1RM group (TEST) worked up to a single maximal repetition. Results The TEST group felt more revitalized and had an increase in positive engagement during their first visit, whereas the HYPER group showed an increase in feelings of physical exhaustion during their first and last visits. There were no pre to post differences for the change in behavior or self-efficacy between groups. Conclusion 1RM training appears to elicit a more favorable affective response, compared with HYPER training, which may ultimately improve adherence to resistance-type exercise.', 'DOI': 'https://doi.org/10.1556/2060.105.2018.2.15', 'Keywords': 'No Keywords Found', 'Full Text Content': 'Ballroom dancing is more intensive for the female partners due to their unique hold technique Authors: M Vaczi , E Tekus , T Atlasz , A Cselko , G Pinter , D Balatincz , M Kaj , and M Wilhelm'}"

Minimal dose strategies, which generally reduce weekly exercise volumes to less than recommended guidelines, might improve muscle strength with minimal time investment. However, minimal dose strategies and their effects on muscle strength are still unclear. Here our aims are to define and characterize minimal dose resistance exercise strategies and summarize their effects on muscle strength in individuals who are not currently engaged in resistance exercise. The minimal dose\xa0strategies overviewed were: “Weekend Warrior,” single-set resistance exercise, resistance exercise “snacking,” practicing the strength test, and eccentric minimal doses. “Weekend Warrior,” which minimizes training frequency, is resistance exercise performed in one weekly session. Single-set resistance exercise, which minimizes set number and session duration, is one set of multiple exercises performed multiple times per week. “Snacks,” which minimize exercise number and session duration, are brief bouts (few minutes) of resistance exercise performed once or more daily. Practicing the strength test, which minimizes repetition number and session duration, is one maximal repetition performed in one or more sets, multiple days per week. Eccentric minimal doses, which eliminate or minimize concentric phase muscle actions, are low weekly volumes of submaximal or maximal eccentric-only repetitions. All approaches increase muscle strength, and some approaches improve other outcomes of health and fitness. “Weekend Warrior” and single-set resistance exercise are the approaches most strongly supported by current research, while snacking and eccentric minimal doses are emerging concepts with promising results. Public health programs can promote small volumes of resistance exercise as being better for muscle strength than no resistance exercise at all.

FormalPara Key Points Many individuals do not perform resistance exercise, with perceived lack of time a commonly cited barrier to participation. Minimal dose resistance exercise, which is resistance exercise that generally does not meet recommended guidelines and involves minimal time investment, warrants consideration for future health promotion efforts. We define and overview evidence for five minimal dose strategies: “Weekend Warrior,” single-set resistance exercise, resistance exercise “snacking,” practicing the strength test, and minimal eccentric resistance exercise. Minimal dose strategies generally improve muscle strength and some other fitness outcomes; thus, they can be recommended to individuals who do not perform resistance exercise. 1 Muscle Strength and Current Guidelines for Resistance Exercise Muscle strength refers to the maximal force that an individual can generate from their muscle voluntarily. Muscle strength decreases with aging [ 1 ]; thus, its maintenance or improvement is important for being able to meet the demands of daily life. Lower muscle strength correlates with or causes poor health outcomes including increased mortality risk, increased risk of falls, and reduced ability to perform activities of daily living [ 1 , 2 , 3 ]. The most effective way for someone to improve, maintain, or restore their muscle strength is by participating regularly in resistance exercise. Resistance exercise is planned and repeated muscle actions against external resistance or one’s body weight. Regular participation in resistance exercise improves physical and mental health and is associated with reduced mortality [ 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 ]. Public health bodies recommend that individuals participate in\u2009resistance exercise or other muscle-strengthening activities (e.g., heavy gardening or carrying heavy loads)\xa0≥\u20092\xa0days per week [ 11 ]. Professional exercise science organizations have also published their own guidelines for resistance exercise participation (Table 1 ). The American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) has published guidelines for healthy adults [ 4 , 5 ] and older adults [ 12 ] as well as individuals with diabetes [ 13 ]. The National Strength and Conditioning Association (NSCA) has published guidelines for healthy youth [ 14 ] and older adults [ 15 ]. Exercise and Sports Science Australia (ESSA) has published guidelines for individuals with cancer [ 16 ], chronic heart failure [ 17 ], chronic kidney disease [ 18 ], chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [ 19 ], diabetes [ 20 ], hypertension [ 21 ], multiple sclerosis [ 22 ], obesity [ 23 ], osteoporosis [ 24 ], peripheral arterial disease [ 25 ], and spinal cord injury [ 26 ]. Overall, these guidelines recommend that individuals participate in two or three resistance exercise sessions per week, with each session consisting of eight to ten exercises that target large muscle groups. The guidelines also recommend that each exercise be performed for one to three sets of 8–15 eccentric–concentric repetitions using a moderate movement speed (1–2\xa0s concentric and 1–2\xa0s eccentric) and interset rests of 1–3\xa0min. Table\xa01 Professional organizations’ population-specific guidelines for resistance exercise Full size table Most individuals do not meet recommended guidelines for participation in resistance exercise or muscle-strengthening activities [ 27 , 28 , 29 ]. A recent review of population-level surveys revealed that approximately 80% of individuals do not meet recommended guidelines for muscle-strengthening activities [ 27 ]. Moreover, approximately 58% of individuals do not participate in any muscle-strengthening activities [ 28 ], and 80% of individuals never participate in free weight or weight machine resistance exercise [ 29 ]. In Table 2 , we summarize results from ten studies that have reported proportions of populations that do not participate in any resistance exercise or muscle-strengthening activities. Table\xa02 Summary of studies that have reported proportions of populations that do not participate in any resistance exercise or muscle-strengthening activities Full size table Perceived lack of time is one of the most frequently cited barriers to exercise participation [ 30 , 31 , 32 , 33 , 34 , 35 , 36 , 37 ]. Perceived lack of time is also a reason why individuals do not adhere to exercise prescriptions and why some individuals discontinue exercise [ 38 , 39 , 40 ]. Given that lack of time is a key obstacle to exercise participation, and many individuals do not participate in any resistance exercise, alternative strategies for facilitating participation appear warranted. Minimal dose resistance exercise is one potential strategy. 2 Minimal Dose Resistance Exercise We define minimal dose resistance exercise as resistance exercise that does not meet guidelines recommended by professional exercise organizations but that still has the potential to improve muscle strength. Typically, minimal dose resistance exercise prescriptions will have lower weekly training volumes compared with prescriptions that are consistent with recommended guidelines. A resistance exercise dose can be made more minimal than current prescription guidelines by reducing exercise frequency, session duration, and/or volume compared with recommended guidelines (Tables 3 , 4 ). The relative load used (i.e., “intensity”), proximity to failure, and the muscle contraction type performed during exercise are also important variables of exercise prescriptions that warrant consideration in minimal dose prescriptions. Table\xa03 Summary of minimal dose approaches to resistance exercise dosing Full size table Table\xa04 Impact of minimal dose resistance exercise strategies on weekly resistance exercise prescriptions compared with current recommended guidelines by programming variable Full size table One reason for examining the potential benefits of minimal dose approaches is to determine if current guidelines for resistance exercise or muscle-strengthening activities, and the public health messaging that promotes them, might require additional consideration. For example, though minimal resistance exercise doses might not meet recommended guidelines, they might still allow for individuals who are not partaking in any physical exercise to increase their muscle strength and perhaps obtain other health benefits associated with resistance exercise participation. Moreover, minimal participation in resistance exercise might act as a “gateway” or “stepping stone” to more frequent participation in the future, though this hypothesis is speculative. 3 Aim of Paper In recent years, exercise scientists have studied or advocated for minimal or time-efficient dose approaches to resistance exercise [ 41 , 42 , 43 , 44 , 45 , 46 , 47 , 48 ]. Previous discussions have typically centered around one or two minimal dose approaches. However, broad overviews of the multiplicity of minimal dose approaches, their definitions, and their evidence is lacking. Therefore, the aims of the current overview are to define and characterize resistance exercise strategies that reflect the minimal dose concept and to summarize evidence of their impact on muscle strength (and other reported outcomes of health and fitness) in persons not currently engaged in resistance exercise. Five strategies were identified that fit the minimal dose concept: “Weekend Warrior,” single-set resistance exercise, resistance exercise “snacking,” practicing the strength test, and eccentric minimal doses (Fig. 1 ). We then discuss the implications and limitations of these minimal dose approaches and directions for future research. Fig.\xa01 Visual representation of program variable characteristics of five minimal dose resistance exercise strategies: “Weekend Warrior,” single-set resistance exercise, resistance exercise “snacks,” practicing the strength test, and minimal dose eccentric resistance exercise. See Tables 3 and 4 for details on each minimal dose strategy. The graphic for resistance\xa0exercise ""snacks"" represents four different ""snacks"" completed on a given day.\xa0*Because practicing the strength test and minimal dose eccentrics have been studied mostly at the proof-of-concept stage, and related study interventions have usually only included only one exercise, the total weekly exercise time for those two approaches presented in the figure is only for one exercise rather than multiple exercises. MVC maximal voluntary contraction, RM repetition maximum Full size image 4 Methods Due to the varying literature on minimal dose exercise, and because some study interventions might not have been conceived of or labeled as minimal dose at the time of publication, we chose\xa0an overview method\xa0rather than a systematic review method to best summarize the relevant literature [ 49 , 50 ]. We have used similar nonsystematic approaches (e.g., “snowballing” searches) in several comprehensive literature reviews [ 27 , 50 , 51 , 52 , 53 , 54 ]. Nevertheless, we acknowledge that some relevant studies could be missing from our discussion and that study quality was not assessed. In general, we tried to limit our overview to studies in which participants had little or no recent history with resistance exercise (i.e., “untrained”). Nevertheless, we cite some studies that included participants with resistance exercise experience. We have done this in instances where, for example, data in untrained individuals were scarce or to illustrate the overall robustness or validity of a concept. Where feasible, we have noted resistance experience in the text and tables. The distinction between studies in the current overview that might be considered “proof-of-concept” versus “ecologically valid” is also important. In the current overview, a proof-of-concept study refers to one in which a basic experimental model was used to test whether a certain minimal volume of resistance exercise increases muscle strength. An example of this is a study that uses a model of eccentric-only repetitions of the elbow flexor muscles performed on an isokinetic dynamometer in a laboratory and under supervision. One reason that such a study can be classified as proof-of-concept is that, unless one is undertaking a rehabilitation program for a specific body muscle group, the goal of most resistance exercise prescriptions is to increase muscle strength for multiple muscle groups. Therefore, when discussing minimal dose approaches, one can reference results from studies whose exercise programs are broadly reflective of “real-world” versions of such programs. For example, “Weekend Warrior” and single-set resistance exercise interventions often include multiple exercises that target major muscle groups. On the other hand, practicing the strength test and eccentric minimal doses are still at the proof-of-concept stage, and their ecological validity might require demonstration in future research. In Table 4 , when comparing the five minimal dose approaches to traditional resistance exercise guidelines, we mostly assumed the mature or real-world versions of these minimal dose strategies rather than their proof-of-concept forms (e.g., multiple muscle groups targeted rather than a single muscle group). Also, in constructing the concept of a minimal dose in the current paper, we refer to the weekly dose of resistance\xa0exercise. That is, we consider strategies that can minimize exercise time, not just from the perspective of a single exercise session, but across an entire week. 5 “Weekend Warriors” “Weekend Warrior” is a phrase used to describe an individual who performs all of their exercise within one (or perhaps two) exercise sessions each week [ 55 ]. The exercise prescription variable that is minimized with the “Weekend Warrior” approach is session frequency. Some “Weekend Warrior” doses meet recommended exercise guidelines, whereas others do not [ 56 ]. Thus, for the current review, we consider the “Weekend Warrior” approach a potential minimal dose strategy. Approximately 1–3% of adults in the USA are “Weekend Warriors” [ 55 ]. In the first study on “Weekend Warriors,” which was not exclusive to participation in resistance exercise, Lee et al. [ 57 ] found that men classified as “Weekend Warriors” at baseline had a lower risk of dying over a 9-year follow-up period than sedentary men. Subsequent studies confirmed that 1–2\xa0days per week of physical exercise, not exclusive to resistance exercise, reduced mortality risk [ 56 , 57 , 58 , 59 , 60 ] and incidence of cardiovascular disease [ 61 ] compared with no exercise. The impact of frequency of resistance exercise on muscle size and strength has also been examined in several studies and reviews of individuals with and without backgrounds in resistance exercise [ 62 , 63 , 64 ]. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, a series of studies on the extensor muscles of the cervical and lumbar spine illustrated that one session of resistance exercise per week, which involved only one exercise of eccentric–concentric repetitions, improved muscle strength of the targeted muscles in untrained [ 65 , 66 , 67 ] and trained individuals [ 68 ]. The findings provided proof of concept that total body resistance exercise programs might increase muscle strength when participation occurs only once per week. Thirty years of subsequent research has illustrated that this is the case. In individuals who are\xa0currently not undertaking resistance exercise, one session of resistance exercise per week, consisting of four or more exercises of eccentric–concentric repetitions per session, improves muscle strength and other measures of physical fitness compared with no exercise (Table 5 ). Table\xa05 “Weekend Warrior”—summary of results from studies that examined changes in muscle strength after resistance exercise programs that were completed 1\xa0day per week and comprised of coupled eccentric–concentric repetitions for\u2009≥\u2009four exercises per session Full size table Literature reviews have indicated more frequent participation in resistance exercise causes greater increases in muscle size and strength (i.e., dose–response relationship) [ 62 , 63 , 64 ]. Nevertheless, differences in gains in muscle size and strength from different exercise frequencies disappear when exercise volume is equated between conditions [ 62 , 63 , 64 ]. Thus, performing one session of resistance exercise per week increases muscle size and strength, and this increase equals that which occurs with greater exercise frequencies when exercise volume is equated throughout the week. Overall, the current evidence suggests that improvements in muscle strength can occur with resistance exercise that is completed only one day per week. The “Weekend Warrior” approach to resistance exercise can be advocated as a minimal dose approach for those who are currently not participating in resistance exercise. It is an approach most appropriate for individuals who have a particular day of the week when they have extended time available for exercise. 6 Single-Set Resistance Exercise Single-set resistance exercise involves performing one set of multiple exercises (usually seven to ten) in an exercise session with multiple sessions occurring each week. The variable of the exercise prescription that is minimized with single-set resistance exercise is the number of sets. The reduced number of sets then reduces session volume and duration compared with resistance exercise programs that consist of multiple sets for each exercise. We acknowledge that some guidelines presented in Table 1 list one set of resistance exercise at the lower end of the set range. However, because some guidelines recommend two or more exercise sets, and because one set of exercise is an approach that will reduce exercise session duration, we consider it a minimal dose approach. The topic of whether one set and multiple sets of resistance exercise produce equal gains in muscle size and strength\xa0in individuals with varying levels of resistance exercise experience\xa0has been reviewed multiple times [ 69 , 70 , 71 , 72 ] and has been a point of contention for many years [ 73 , 74 ]. Here, our focus is on whether one set of exercise causes within-group improvements in muscle strength and whether these improvements are greater than observed in control groups who do not perform resistance exercise. In Table 6 , we summarize evidence showing that resistance exercise programs consisting of one set of coupled eccentric–concentric repetitions for four or more exercises per session (≥\u20092 sessions per week) improve muscle strength and other markers of physical fitness in both untrained and trained individuals. Few studies included control groups for comparison, but the strength gains observed in the resistance exercise groups (~\u200920%) were greater than those typically observed in control groups who do not participate in resistance exercise. Thus, single-set resistance exercise can be advocated as an effective minimal dose strategy for individuals who are currently not participating in resistance exercise. Table\xa06 Single-set resistance exercise—summary of results from select studies that examined changes in muscle strength after resistance exercise programs completed\u2009≥\u20092\xa0days per week and comprised of 1 set of coupled eccentric–concentric repetitions for\u2009≥\u2009four exercises per session Full size table 7 Daily Resistance Exercise “Snacks” A resistance exercise “snack” is a low volume of resistance exercise that is performed once or more daily, often multiple days per week. Islam et al. [ 75 ] defined an exercise snack as “isolated\u2009≤\u20091-min bouts of vigorous exercise performed periodically throughout the day.” “Snacking” was initially used as an exercise prescription method to improve cardiometabolic health [ 76 ], but the technique has expanded to include resistance exercise prescriptions. The variable of the exercise prescription that is minimized with exercise snacks is session duration, and this is accomplished by reducing the\xa0number of exercises or sets compared with more traditional resistance exercise prescriptions. The frequency of exercise is also higher with snacks compared with more traditional approaches, and snacks have typically involved sets of eccentric–concentric repetitions [ 45 , 46 , 77 , 78 ]. At least three studies have examined resistance exercise snacking programs in healthy adults without a recent history of resistance exercise (Table 7 ). Kowalsky et al. [ 45 ] examined daily resistance exercise snacks over a 1-week period on measures of muscular discomfort and sleepiness among 24 university students. Each day, participants completed eight different exercises as eight separate snacks distributed across the day. Each snack consisted of two sets of 15 repetitions of the following exercises: chair stands, desk/table pushups, alternating lunges, calf raises, biceps curls, lateral rows, upright rows, and deadlifts with a resistance band. The same participants also completed a control condition in which they did not complete the exercise snacks. The results revealed that participants experienced lower muscular discomfort and reduced daytime sleepiness during the week they completed the exercise versus the control week when they did not complete the exercise. Table\xa07 Daily resistance exercise “snacks”—summary of results from studies that examined changes in muscle strength in healthy adults [ 45 , 46 , 77 ] and patient groups [ 79 , 80 , 81 , 82 , 83 ] after resistance exercise programs in which multiple, low volume exercise sessions (i.e., “snacks”) were completed 5 or 7\xa0days per week Full size table Two studies have also examined daily resistance exercise snacks in healthy older adults without a recent history of resistance exercise [ 46 , 77 ]. In one study [ 46 ], ten older adults completed home-based resistance exercise snacks twice per day for 28\xa0days. One snack occurred in the morning; the other snack occurred in the evening. Each snack consisted of five exercises, and each of the five exercises was completed for as many repetitions as possible over a 1-min period. The exercises included: chair sit-to-stand, seated knee extension, standing knee bends, marching on the spot, and standing calf raises. A 1-min rest separated each exercise, culminating in 9\xa0min of exercise. Participants who completed the exercise program showed greater improvements in the sit-to-stand test, leg press power, and thigh muscle cross-sectional area than participants who did not participate in the exercise program. In another study [ 77 ], community-dwelling older adults completed a home-based resistance exercise snack program delivered remotely once, twice, or three times per day for 4\xa0weeks. Each snack was 9\xa0min, totaling 9, 18, and 27\xa0min of exercise per day for the three groups, respectively. Adherence rates to the exercise programs were 97, 82, and 81%, respectively. The interventions did not cause significant improvements in sit-to-stand performance compared with control (no exercise). However, the interventions were generally rated as enjoyable and easy to perform, and 82% of exercise participants planned to continue the exercise program after the study. The authors concluded that resistance exercise snacks may be feasible for home-based resistance exercise for older adults when delivered and monitored remotely. Finally, one study examined the acute postprandial glycemic responses to resistance exercise snacks [ 78 ]. In one testing session, study participants sat for 4\xa0h without activity in the evening. In another session, they performed three minutes of resistance exercise every 30\xa0min over the 4\xa0h. The resistance exercises were chair squats, calf raises, and standing knee raises with straight leg hop extensions. The main finding was that the resistance exercise snacks reduced postprandial glucose and insulin responses compared with no exercise, which suggests that interrupting sitting with brief resistance exercise might have cardiometabolic health benefits, although longer-term snack training studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis. In a series of studies, resistance exercise snacks completed 5\xa0days per week (sometimes considered “daily” exercise) were prescribed to individuals with neck and shoulder pain [ 79 , 80 , 81 , 82 ]. Andersen et al. [ 79 ] submitted individuals with frequent neck/shoulder pain to 10\xa0weeks of daily progressive resistance exercise. Only the lateral raise exercise with elastic tube resistance was completed in the exercise program. One group of participants performed 2\xa0min of exercise daily, and another group performed 12\xa0min of exercise daily. Compared with a control group who did not complete the exercise, participants in the exercise groups showed larger reductions in neck/shoulder pain and tenderness and greater improvements in muscle strength. The authors concluded that as little as 2\xa0min of targeted daily progressive resistance exercise caused clinically meaningful reductions in pain and tenderness in adults with frequent neck/shoulder symptoms. In a similar study of individuals who had frequent neck/shoulder pain, Jay et al. [ 81 ] found that 10\xa0weeks of resistance exercise with elastic tubes 2 or 12\xa0min per day increased muscle strength and rate of force development more than no resistance exercise. Also, in 30 female office workers with chronic neck and shoulder pain, Lidegaard et al. [ 82 ] found that 2\xa0min per day of resistance exercise with elastic tubes increased muscle strength and decreased pain intensity compared with no resistance exercise. Finally, in a study of 198 office workers who had frequent neck/shoulder pain, Andersen et al. [ 80 ] found that 10\xa0weeks of resistance exercise with elastic tubes used for 2 or 12\xa0min per day decreased headache frequency compared with no resistance exercise but did not impact headache intensity and duration. Overall, resistance exercise snacking shows promise as a minimal dosing strategy for improving movement capacity in older adults [ 46 , 77 , 83 ] and reducing pain in patients with neck and shoulder pain [ 79 , 80 , 81 , 82 ]. Many of the reviewed studies utilized low-effort body weight exercises. Thus, these snacking approaches might be most applicable to older adults, patients, and individuals who dislike exercising due to perceived discomfort associated with exercise intensity. Future research can explore more thoroughly the impact of resistance exercise snacking on health and fitness in younger and healthier adults who are currently not partaking in resistance exercise. 8 Practicing the Strength Test Practicing the strength test involves performing one repetition per set with a maximal resistance and doing this for one or more sets within a given session. The variable of the exercise prescription that is minimized with practicing the strength test is the number of exercise repetitions. This then reduces session volume and duration. Experiments on practicing the strength test have been conducted using maximal isometric exercise [i.e., isometric maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) training] and maximal loads during coupled eccentric–concentric repetitions [i.e., one repetition maximum (1RM) training]. In some interventions, the strength test has been practiced daily. In other interventions, the strength test has been practiced on nonconsecutive days. Strength tests that are practiced daily can be considered a type of resistance exercise snacks. 8.1 Practicing Maximal Isometric Exercise Performing maximal contractions regularly for exercise and rehabilitation purposes is a concept that has been understood for several decades. Between 1894 and 1979, 34% of all research papers on resistance exercise included interventions with frequencies of 5, 6, or 7\xa0days per week—called “daily training” [ 51 ]. These interventions often included low volumes of maximal isometric exercise of the elbow flexor, knee extensor, and hand grip muscles (Table 8 ). When performed daily for brief periods, practicing the strength test is a resistance exercise snack with maximal resistance. As shown in Table 8 , daily maximal isometric exercise increases isometric MVC strength. Though performing the same isometric tasks at submaximal resistances is also likely to increase muscle strength and endurance [ 84 , 85 , 86 , 87 ], we have highlighted only interventions that involve practicing maximal isometric strength tests, in part, because these would be the most time efficient. The isometric MVC requires only a couple of seconds of effort to recruit the entire motor neuron pool, whereas submaximal isometric contractions require more time to achieve the same physiological outcome [ 88 ]. The study by Cotten [ 89 ] serves as a useful example. In this study, four groups of participants completed a single set involving one sustained isometric contraction until failure. One group performed an isometric MVC and the other groups performed the task until failure at 25, 50, and 75% MVC. The four groups each improved their isometric strength by\u2009~\u200910%. Thus, performing the brief MVC was the most time efficient way to achieve the 10% increase\xa0in muscle strength. Table\xa08 Practicing the isometric strength test—summary of results from studies that examined changes in muscle strength after isometric resistance exercise programs that typically involved five to seven sessions per week, completed in 3\xa0min or fewer per session, and involved minimal numbers of repetitions at maximal repetitions [i.e., 100% of the isometric maximal voluntary contraction (MVC)] Full size table Studies on daily maximal grip training can be considered proof of concept for the broader ideas of practicing the strength test and of minimal resistance exercise doses. However, daily maximal grip practice should not be disregarded as its own standalone exercise prescription (i.e., ecological validity), particularly in rehabilitation programs for patients whose grip capacity is reduced (e.g., stroke). Grip strength correlates with mortality [ 90 , 91 , 92 ] and ability to perform activities of daily living [ 93 , 94 , 95 , 96 ]. Moreover, one review concluded that isometric hand grip exercise, which is often minimal in its prescription, reduces resting systolic blood pressure and induces hypoalgesia [ 97 ]. Also, the ability to perform such exercise on consecutive days could lessen injury recovery times. For example, in a group of healthy participants who had resistance exercise experience, Barss et al. [ 98 ] compared maximal hand grip training for 18 consecutive days versus a more traditional prescription that spread maximal hand grip training over 42\xa0days but still totaled 18 sessions (i.e., three sessions per week for 6\xa0weeks). The traditional program increased peak force of the trained and untrained hands by 14.6 and 12.5%, respectively. The trained and untrained limbs became significantly stronger at the end of the third and fourth weeks of training, respectively. The daily grip training increased peak force in the trained and untrained hands by 9.7 and 7.8%, respectively. The untrained limb became significantly stronger after the 15th day of training. Thus, the study illustrated that if the purpose of a rehabilitation program is to significantly increase grip strength in the untrained limb as quickly as possible, then daily maximum grip training is the more appropriate approach. 8.2 Practicing Eccentric–Concentric Repetitions with Maximal Loads Using the daily 1RM training model, Dankel et al. [ 99 ] examined changes in muscle size and strength of the elbow flexors in five resistance-trained men who completed different resistance exercise programs with their right and left arms for 21 consecutive days. With one arm (“training arm”), they performed a 1RM test, an isometric MVC, and three sets of exercise at 70% 1RM. With their other arm (“testing arm”), participants completed only the 1RM and MVC strength tests. After 21 consecutive days, 1RM strength increased similarly (~\u20092\xa0kg) in the “training arm” and “testing arm,” whereas muscle thickness increases occurred only in the “training arm.” Also, no improvements in MVC strength were observed in either group. Using the nonconsecutive days 1RM training model in untrained participants, Mattocks et al. [ 100 ] compared practicing the strength test to a higher exercise volume protocol. One group of participants completed 1RMs for the knee extension and chest press exercises 2\xa0days per week for 8\xa0weeks, while another group completed four sets of those exercises to volitional failure with an 8–12RM load. Overall, gains in muscle strength 1RM, isometric, and isokinetic strength were similar between the two groups. Improvements in upper-body muscle endurance (repetitions to failure at 60% 1RM) were also similar between groups. However, the group that completed a greater volume of exercise experienced more muscle hypertrophy of the triceps brachii\xa0and vastus lateralis, and greater improvements in muscle endurance of the knee extensors. In another study [ 41 ], 20 untrained young adults completed two resistance exercise sessions per week for 8\xa0weeks. Each session consisted of five repetitions of both the chest press and knee extension machine exercises. Participants were assigned the task of attempting to lift the maximal resistance possible for each repetition, with 90-s rest between repetitions. Participants who completed this minimal dose program experienced affective responses during the exercise sessions (e.g., revitalization and positive engagement) that were equal to or slightly better than the responses experienced among a separate group of participants who completed four sets of 8–12 repetitions (to volitional failure) per exercise session. Neither exercise program improved self-efficacy. Overall, practicing the isometric MVC test daily over a few weeks improves isometric muscle strength. Thus, maximal isometric contractions can be prescribed as minimal doses for individuals who do not participate in resistance exercise and who find eccentric–concentric resistance exercise unfeasible or unenjoyable. Moreover, daily minimal doses of maximal isometric contractions might represent an underutilized strategy for increasing muscle strength quickly. Preliminary results from research on practicing the 1RM strength test on nonconsecutive days appear promising [ 100 ], but more research is required to determine whether this prescription method is feasible and whether it\xa0increases muscle strength in untrained individuals in nonlaboratory settings. 9 Minimal Doses of Eccentric Resistance Exercise Muscle action or contraction type is one variable of resistance exercise programming that has received little attention in position papers on resistance exercise guidelines (Table 1 ) and in previous discussions on minimal dose resistance exercise strategies [ 47 ]. A typical repetition of a resistance exercise consists of both an eccentric (i.e., active muscle lengthening) and concentric (i.e., active muscle shortening) muscle action (i.e., a coupled eccentric–concentric repetition). Eccentric resistance exercise has been known for many years to provide a potent stimulus for improving muscle size and strength [ 101 , 102 , 103 , 104 , 105 ]. Eccentric resistance exercise also increases joint range of motion [ 106 , 107 , 108 ] and thus can replace static stretching in an exercise program to reduce overall exercise time [ 109 ]. Also, when eccentric and concentric resistance exercise are completed with equal absolute workloads, cardiovascular stress and perceptions of effort are lower during eccentric exercise [ 110 , 111 , 112 , 113 , 114 , 115 ]. This suggests a unique role for prescriptions of eccentric resistance exercise for older adults and those with cardiovascular or other medical conditions [ 116 , 117 ], who might benefit from minimal dose training strategies. Nevertheless, we are aware of only one paper that has discussed eccentrics as a potential minimal dose approach [ 47 ]. A likely reason that eccentric resistance exercise has not received more attention in previous discussions on minimal dose strategies is that traditional resistance exercise equipment (e.g., free weights, plate-loaded machines, and weight stack machines) is not conducive to performing eccentric resistance exercise [ 118 ]. Exercising with such equipment involves use of the same load in the eccentric and concentric phases, which probably does not maximize dose potency. The reason that exercise dose potency is likely hindered is that concentric muscle strength is\u2009~\u200940% less than eccentric muscle strength in humans [ 53 ], and traditional resistance exercise equipment necessarily accommodates the weaker concentric phase. As traditional equipment is what most individuals have access to, there has not been a need to consider muscle contraction type in resistance exercise guidelines. Such\xa0guidelines have always assumed eccentric–concentric repetitions performed with a given constant external load. However, these assumptions require reconsideration because new exercise equipment is making\xa0differential loading in the eccentric and concentric phases possible [ 119 , 120 , 121 , 122 ]. Consequently, opportunities to participate in eccentric-only and accentuated eccentric resistance exercise (i.e., “eccentric overload”) are likely to increase in the future. Minimal dose eccentric resistance exercise involves a low weekly session volume of submaximal or maximal eccentric-only repetitions. Variables of the exercise prescription that are minimized with minimal dose eccentric prescriptions are the number of concentric (i.e., zero) and eccentric muscle actions. Minimal dose eccentric exercise performed with maximal eccentric resistances [ 123 , 124 , 125 ] represents a specific type of practicing the strength test or maximal resistance exercise snacking. Research on minimal dose eccentrics is currently at the proof-of-concept stage. In 1960, Bonde-Petersen [ 123 ] examined the effects of ten daily maximal eccentric repetitions, ten daily isometric MVCs, and one daily isometric MVCs on muscle strength and found that MVC strength increased only for participants who completed ten daily isometric MVCs. However, results from contemporary studies challenge these original findings (Table 9 ). Table\xa09 Eccentric minimal dose resistance exercise—summary of results from studies that have examined changes in muscle strength after minimal dose resistance exercise programs comprised of eccentric-only repetitions Full size table Sato et al. [ 124 ] compared the effects of a 3-s isometric MVC, concentric MVC, or eccentric MVC of the elbow flexors performed daily (5\xa0days per week for 4\xa0weeks) on muscle strength of the elbow flexors and muscle thickness of biceps brachii and brachialis. Exercise was performed on an isokinetic dynamometer. Participants who performed the once daily eccentric MVC had the most robust improvements in muscle strength. Across isometric, concentric, and eccentric MVC strength tests, the group that performed the minimal dose eccentric exercise improved their muscle strength by 10–13%. The group who performed the once daily concentric MVC improved only their isometric MVC torque by 6%. The group who performed the once daily isometric MVC improved only their eccentric MVC torque by 7%. The exercise protocols caused little to no muscle soreness and no changes in muscle thicknesses. The control group showed no changes in muscle strength. Yoshida et al. [ 125 ] compared the effects of different minimal dose maximal eccentric resistance exercise programs of the elbow flexors on muscle strength of the elbow flexors and muscle thickness of biceps brachii and brachialis. Thirty-six healthy university students were randomized into three groups who performed the exercise on an isokinetic dynamometer: 1\xa0day per week (one set\u2009×\u2009six maximal eccentric contractions, six contractions per week), 1\xa0day per week (five sets\u2009×\u20096 maximal eccentric contractions once per week, 30 contractions per week), or 5\xa0days per week (one set\u2009×\u20096 maximal eccentric contractions, 30 contractions per week). The two groups who performed only 1\xa0day of exercise per week did not experience changes in muscle strength. The group who performed the exercise 5\xa0days per week increased eccentric MVC torque (13.5%), concentric MVC torque (11.1%), and isometric MVC torque (9.3%). The exercise protocols caused little or no muscle soreness. The results indicated that completing a small number of maximal eccentric contractions throughout the week leads to greater gains in muscle strength than performing a larger volume of eccentric muscle actions once per week. In a follow-up study, Yoshida et al. [ 126 ] found that one 3-s maximal eccentric contraction of the elbow flexors improved muscle strength by 10–15% when performed once per day, 5\xa0days per week, over 4\xa0weeks. However, participants who performed the same exercise three days per week experienced only a\u2009~\u20093% increase in strength, and participants who performed the exercise once per week experienced no change in muscle strength. None of the groups experienced muscle hypertrophy. Chen et al. [ 127 ] examined the effects of repeating 30 low-load eccentric muscle actions on muscle strength of the elbow flexors and muscle thickness of biceps brachii and brachialis. The dumbbell used in the study was equal to 10% of the isometric MVC. The study included three groups of participants who performed eccentric exercise in different configurations: 1 bout, 8 bouts (2 bouts per week for 4\xa0weeks), or 16 bouts (2 bouts per week for 8\xa0weeks). The results indicated that repeating low-intensity eccentric resistance exercise increased muscle size and strength and protected against future muscle damage of the exercised muscles. Overall, results from studies summarized in this section and in Table 9 suggest that minimal dose eccentrics can be advocated as a minimal dose approach for those who are currently not participating in resistance exercise. Also, although the current review is focused primarily on nonathlete populations, it is important to acknowledge that the Nordic hamstring exercise is another eccentric-only exercise that has been prescribed in low weekly volumes and been found to increase muscle strength in competitive and recreational athletes in most instances [ 128 , 129 , 130 , 131 , 132 ]. 10 Strategies to Enhance Minimal Doses In the preceding sections, we illustrated that various minimal dose approaches to resistance exercise increase muscle strength. We acknowledge that greater gains in muscle size and strength are possible with higher exercise volumes and intensities [ 72 , 133 , 134 ]. Thus, methods to increase exercise volume while maintaining the same minimal exercise time warrant discussion. Drop sets are a method that can be used to prolong time under tension. Drop sets involve performing a set of resistance exercise to momentary muscular failure (or close to failure), then immediately reducing the load (multiple times) to increase the work completed over a brief time. In untrained and trained men, drop sets provided similar gains in muscle size and strength as volume-matched routines without drop sets [ 135 , 136 , 137 ]. Moreover, new connected adaptive resistance exercise machines (CARE) make drop sets more feasible than with traditional resistance exercise equipment [ 118 , 119 , 120 , 121 ]. Unlike with free weights, where the individual must momentarily disengage with the resistance to remove bar collars and weight plates to perform the next lighter drop set, CARE machines automatically reduce the resistance for the individual. Rest–pause training is another strategy that can be used to enhance minimal resistance exercise doses. Rest–pause training involves lifting a fixed load with an initial set to failure (typically 10–12 repetitions), followed by subsequent sets to failure using short (e.g., 10–20\xa0s) interset rest intervals [ 138 ]. For instance, 20 repetitions might be achieved by first completing 12 repetitions, followed by 4, then 3, then 1 repetition interspersed by short 20-s rest periods. Rest–pause training performed over several weeks causes comparable or larger increases in muscle size and strength compared with resistance exercise routines that do not involve rest–pauses in trained individuals [ 139 , 140 , 141 ]. Importantly, rest–pause training reduces exercise session duration. For instance, in one study, session time was reduced from\u2009~\u200957\xa0min during traditional resistance exercise sessions to\u2009~\u200935\xa0min during sessions that incorporated rest–pauses [ 141 ]. Thus, rest–pause resistance exercise appears to provide the same benefits as traditional resistance exercise strategies while reducing exercise time. Nevertheless, drop set and rest–pause strategies exacerbate acute muscle fatigue and increase perceptions of discomfort and fatigue compared with more traditional resistance exercise methods, where sets are not taken to failure [ 142 , 143 ]. Thus, drop set and rest–pause strategies might not be feasible for individuals who have low pain tolerances or who are currently not participating in any resistance exercise. Instead, drop set and rest–pause strategies might be more appropriate for, and of greater interest to, individuals who are seeking to add variety to their current minimal dose programs. 11 Preferences for Resistance Exercise Preferences for resistance exercise, a topic that has been minimally researched [ 27 ], should also be considered when prescribing minimal doses of resistance exercise. Preferences often exist for exercise location (home, gym, outdoors, and treatment center), interpersonal contact during exercise (exercise alone, exercise with friend, and exercise with group), supervision, competition, equipment type (free weights, elastic bands, etc.), and exercise intensity (low, moderate, or high) [ 27 ]. Preferences might also exist for aspects of the resistance exercise experience closely linked to minimal dose prescriptions, for example, preferred weekly training frequency,   session duration, and set configurations. Based on the evidence overviewed herein, individuals can, for the most part, choose the dosing strategy that meets their personal preferences and schedules. “Weekend Warrior”, single-set resistance exercise, and resistance exercise snack approaches are probably the minimal dose approaches that offer the best combination of practicality and potential for increasing muscle strength. 12 Limitations of Minimal Dose Approaches The most notable limitation of minimal dose approaches is that they are unlikely to induce the same magnitude of improvement in physical and mental health outcomes compared with more traditional approaches to resistance exercise. For example, individuals who exercise more than 1\xa0day per week (not exclusive to resistance exercise) are further protected from mortality than “Weekend Warriors” [ 56 , 58 , 60 ]. Also, greater resistance exercise frequencies cause the greatest improvements in muscle size and strength because they entail greater exercise volumes [ 62 , 63 , 64 ]. Moreover, multiset resistance exercise programs typically cause greater improvements in muscle size and strength than single-set programs when the two are not matched for exercise volume [ 69 , 70 , 71 , 72 ]. Nevertheless, as shown in the current review, minimal dose approaches increase muscle strength and some other fitness outcomes, and this is more than what occurs with no resistance exercise. Minimal dose approaches might also act as “gateways” to more traditional resistance exercise programs, whereby initial exposure to, and adaptation from, a minimal dose program might cause longer-term behavior change. A second potential limitation of some minimal dose approaches, such as daily exercise snacking, is that some individuals will not be able to adopt such a program due to lack of access to resistance exercise equipment at home or at work. Nevertheless, some resistance exercise equipment is accessible and affordable (e.g., elastic bands). Also, there are many instances in which access to resistance exercise equipment is a short distance from one’s residence. For example, fitness centers are located on school campuses where many students and staff reside and work; living residences (e.g., apartment complexes, hotels) often have small fitness centers within them; and some workplaces (11–18%) have fitness centers or equipment onsite [ 144 , 145 ]. Local parks might also have equipment for body weight exercises such as push-ups, pull-ups, and step-ups. Thus, access to resistance exercise equipment might not be a significant barrier to some minimal dose strategies. A third potential limitation is that in some studies cited in the tables, interventions were comprised of only one single-joint exercise. For example, studies on minimal dose eccentric resistance exercise have often consisted of only unilateral elbow flexion exercise on an isokinetic dynamometer [ 124 , 125 , 146 ]. Such studies lack direct practical application because isokinetic dynamometers are not readily available to most individuals, and exercise programs should target more than one muscle group of one limb. These studies, then, provide proof of concept of the minimal dose approach, but they lack ecological validity. Moreover, muscle soreness and damage from eccentric resistance exercise is another potential concern, though the minimal eccentric dose strategies reviewed here caused little or no muscle damage and soreness [ 124 , 125 ]. New technologies are making eccentric resistance exercise, including multijoint exercise, more feasible outside laboratory environments [ 118 , 122 , 147 ]. Thus, individuals undertaking eccentric resistance exercise at home or the gym should be made aware of the possibility of muscle damage and how to minimize it. Future research can continue to explore the dose–response relationship between eccentric resistance exercise and muscle damage. This research can seek to establish eccentric resistance exercise dose–response relationships for various muscle groups and explore ways to prescribe eccentric resistance exercise that minimize exercise-induced muscle damage while causing gains in muscle size and strength. This can lead to recommendations on how to best periodize or progress eccentric resistance exercise. A fourth potential limitation is that some of the cited studies involved direct instruction and supervision and participation under controlled conditions. Supervision and verbal encouragement impact muscle strength performance and outcomes from resistance exercise interventions [ 1 , 148 , 149 ]. Thus, effects observed in some of the cited studies might be larger than what would be expected in non-research settings. Moreover, in some of the studies cited in this review, encouragement and supervision occurred within the context of interventions that involved maximal efforts and/or use of maximal or near-maximal resistances (e.g., practicing the strength test). Individuals who undertake resistance exercise unsupervised are unlikely to exercise with maximal or near-maximal resistances [ 27 , 150 ]. This then questions the ecological validity or feasibility of minimal dose programs that involve maximal contractions. Nevertheless, even if individuals were prescribed a program of maximal isometric contractions, and their actual effort amounted to 70 or 80% MVC, the strength of their muscles is still likely to increase [ 86 ]. Finally, we have not provided a recommendation for which minimal dose programs should be adopted. Instead, we have shown evidence that various minimal dose approaches improve or maintain muscle strength in nonathlete populations. Thus, individuals who are currently not partaking in resistance exercise should be encouraged to participate in the resistance exercise program that they are most likely to adhere to over an extended period. Future research can help to describe dose–response relationships for various minimal dose approaches and determine which minimal dose programs result in the greatest exercise adherence and/or health benefits. The current review focused on muscle strength as a key outcome, because muscle strength correlates with mortality and other outcomes of health and fitness [ 1 , 2 , 3 ]. The results presented in the table footnotes throughout the current paper show that minimal dose approaches sometimes improve outcomes other than muscle strength, such as muscle mass, muscle endurance, and up-and-go times. The effectiveness of minimal dose approaches for improving other outcomes, such as risk of falls, can be considered in future research. 13 Conclusions Minimal dose approaches to resistance exercise increase muscle strength and sometimes improve other physical fitness outcomes. Thus, even though minimal dose approaches might not meet current guidelines for resistance exercise published by professional exercise organizations, adoption of minimal dose approaches can be encouraged for individuals who do not engage in any resistance exercise. Such individuals can be informed that “something is better than nothing” and “every muscle contraction (or repetition) counts.” Individuals who have the time and resources to participate in exercise volumes that are greater than minimal dose programs should be encouraged to do so. Future research can explore dose–response relationships of minimal and traditional approaches to resistance exercise to determine their associated adherence rates and health benefits.

Split or full-body workout routine: which is best to increase muscle strength and hypertrophy?,"['AL Evangelista', 'TV Braz', 'CV La Scala Teixeira']",2021,Workout Routine training does not enhance muscle strength adaptations in untrained males  compared to Full-Body Workout Routine training short-term equal-volume resistance training,12,https://www.scielo.br/j/eins/a/sQYb5T8zwYNzgNCpK8pDYwF/?lang=en,"{'Title': 'Split or full-body workout routine: which is best to increase muscle strength and hypertrophy?', 'Authors': 'No Authors Found', 'Abstract': 'No Abstract Found', 'DOI': 'https://doi.org/10.31744/einstein_journal/2021AO5781', 'Keywords': 'No Keywords Found', 'Full Text Content': 'ABSTRACT Objective: To compare the effects of different resistance training programs on measures of muscle strength and hypertrophy. Methods: Sixty-seven untrained subjects were randomized to one of two groups: Split Workout Routine (n=35), in which muscle groups were trained twice per week in an A/B split consisting of eight sets per session, or Full-Body Workout Routine (n=32), in which muscle groups were trained four times per week with four and eight sets per session. Both groups performed eight to 12 repetition maximum per set, with 60 seconds of rest between sets. Maximal strength and muscle thickness were assessed at baseline and after eight weeks of training. Results: A significant main effect of time (pre versus post) was observed for maximal strength in the bench press and squat exercises and thickness of the elbow extensor, elbow flexor and quadriceps femoris muscles. Selected variables did not differ significantly between groups. Conclusion: Resistance training twice or four times per week has similar effects on neuromuscular adaptation, provided weekly set volume is equal. Keywords: Resistance training; Muscle development/physiology; Muscle, skeletal/growth & development; Muscle strength; Hypertrophy RESUMO Objetivo: Comparar os efeitos de diferentes rotinas de treinamento em medidas de força e hipertrofia muscular. Métodos: Foram distribuídos em dois grupos de treinamento 67 indivíduos não treinados: Rotina Distribuída (n=35), com os grupos musculares treinados duas vezes por semana em uma divisão A/B com oito séries por sessão, ou Rotina de Corpo Inteiro (n=32), com os grupos musculares treinados quatro vezes por semana com quatro e oito séries por sessão de treinamento. Ambos os grupos realizaram de oito a 12 repetições máximas por série, com intervalo de 60 segundos entre as séries. A força e a espessura muscular máximas foram avaliadas no início e após oito semanas de treinamento. Resultados: Observaram-se diferenças significativas considerando o tempo (pré versus pós) para força máxima no supino, agachamento e espessura muscular de extensores do cotovelo, flexores do cotovelo e músculos do quadríceps femoral.

Descritores: Treinamento de resistência; Desenvolvimento muscular/fisiologia; Músculo esquelético/crescimento & desenvolvimento; Força muscular; Hipertrofia INTRODUCTION Resistance training (RT) is widely known as the most effective way to increase muscle strength and mass, i.e., muscle hypertrophy in humans. ( 1 ) Maximization of muscle adaptation requires proper manipulation of RT variables. One variable of particular interest is RT frequency. Frequency is sometimes defined as the number of training sessions per week. However, the number of times a given muscle group is trained per week is a more common definition. In a recent meta-analysis, hypertrophic gains were associated with training muscle groups more than once per week. ( 2 ) However, it is not clear whether higher weekly training frequencies translate into superior gains relative to lower frequencies. The paucity of studies addressing higher frequency of training may stem from the premise that a minimum of 48 hours of recovery between training sessions targeting the same muscle groups is needed, as per guidelines published by the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM). ( 3 ) Dankel et al., ( 4 ) recently challenged the ideia that muscles require a minimum of 48 hours to recover from a training session. The research hypothesis in that study was that the combination of lower training volume and higher frequency would help to increase the area under the curve of muscle protein synthesis response, leading to greater muscle mass gains over time. Plausibility aside, few studies to date have tested this hypothesis in young sedentary individuals. OBJECTIVE To compare the effects of different resistance training programs on muscle strength and hypertrophy measures. METHODS Participants Eighty-six healthy young men volunteered to participate in this study. Participants were assigned to Split Workout Routine and Full-Body Workout Routine Groups using a computer-based random number generator. Randomization occurred within blocks of six subjects. In each block, two subjects were allocated to each group in order to achieve a 1:1 recruitment balance throughout the study. A sample size of 16 subjects per group was determined according to a prior study. ( 5 ) Exclusion criteria were as follows: strength training background for the last 6 months, clinical diagnosis of diabetes mellitus , being a smoker, musculoskeletal complications and/or cardiovascular changes confirmed by medical evaluation. Nineteen participants dropped out of the study for personal reasons. The final sample comprised 67 participants, who were randomized to one of two groups: Split Workout Routine (n=35; age: 26.2±4.6 years; height: 1.69±0.07mts; body mass: 69.9±9kg) or Full-Body Workout Routine (n=32; age: 27.5±7.6 years; height: 1.7±0.08mts; body mass: 72.5±13.9kg). The experimental period consisted of 10 weeks. The first week corresponded to familiarization and pre-intervention period (baseline); during the second to ninth week, we had the training intervention period; and the tenth week was the postintervention period. Participants in this study read and signed an informed consent form. This study was approved by the Ethics and Research Committee (CAAE: 83122818.0.0000.5511, protocol number 2.549.504/2018) of and conducted at Universidade Nove de Julho . Maximal strength assessment Maximal dynamic strength assessment was based on the one repetition maximum (1RM) test using the bench press (1R MBENCH PRESS ) and the squat (1RM SQUAT ) exercises. Specifically the 1RM SQUAT was performed with 90° of amplitude using a smith machine equipment. Maximal dynamic strength was measured at baseline and at the end of the study. The test protocol was designed according to recommendations given elsewhere. ( 6 ) Prior to baseline assessment, subjects were instructed to refrain from exercise other than activities of daily living for a minimum of 72 hours. Similar instructions were given prior to the final assessment. In brief, participants performed a general warm-up consisting of a 5-minute walk on a treadmill (Movement Technology, São Paulo, Brazil) at 60% of maximum heart rate. This was followed by two specific warm-upsets with proper lifting technique. The first set consisted of five repetitions at ~50% of the estimated 1RM weight. A second set of three repetitions with loads corresponding to ~60 to 80% of the estimated 1RM weight was then executed. Subjects were allowed a 3-minute rest period between sets. Finally, subjects had five attempts at 1RM with a 3-minute rest period between trials. 1RM was operationally defined as the maximum weight that could be lifted a single time with proper technique. Verbal encouragement was given throughout the 1RM test session. Sessions were supervised by the research team to ensure safety and validity of attempts. Muscle thickness assessment Ultrasound imaging was used to measure the muscle thickness (MT) at baseline and at the end of the study. A trained technician performed all measurements using B-mode ultrasonography (Mindray; DP10; Shenzhen, China). Following application of generous amounts of water-soluble transmission gel (Mercur S.A., Body Care, Santa Cruz do Sul, RS, Brazil) to the measurement site, a 7.5 to 10MHz linear probe was positioned perpendicular to the target muscle without compressing the skin. Settings were selected according to manufacturer’s specifications for optimal image quality and kept constant throughout. Satisfactory images were saved to a computer hard drive and MT estimated by measuring the distance from the subcutaneous adipose-muscle tissue interface to the muscle-bone interface, as previously described. ( 7 ) Measurements were made on the right side of the body at 4 sites, as follows: biceps brachii (MT BB ), t riceps brachii (MT TB ), vastus lateralis (MT VL ) and rectus femoris (MT RF ). Upper arm and lower limb measurements were made with participants in the standing and the supine position respectively. On the anterior and posterior aspects of the upper arm, measurements were made at 60% of the distance between the lateral epicondyle of the humerus and the acromion process of the scapula. Thigh muscle measurements were made at 50% of the distance between the lateral condyle of the femur and the greater trochanter. The limb was secured to minimize unwanted movement during measurements. Anatomical landmarks were marked with henna dye to ensure consistency between pre-and post-intervention measurements. Markings were touched up weekly. Images were obtained 48 to 72 hours after the final training session to avoid potential interferences of post-workout muscle swelling with results. Research has shown acutely increased MT to return to baseline within 48 hours of RT. ( 8 ) To further ensure the accuracy of measurements, a minimum of three images were obtained per site. Measurements differing by less than 1mm were averaged to a final value. Whenever measurements differed by more than 1mm, a fourth image was obtained and the three closest measurements averaged. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for test-retest for MT BB , MT TB , MT RF and MT VL was 0.998 (95% confidence interval – 95%CI: 0.986-0.999), 0.996 (95%CI: 0.981-0.999), 0.999 (95%CI: 0.972-0.999), and 0.995 (95%CI: 0.980-0.998), respectively. The standard error of the mean (SEM) for these measures was 0.42mm (95%CI: 0.22-0.62mm), 0.29mm (95%CI: 0.12-0.47mm), 0.41mm (95%CI: 0.09-0.73mm) and 0.52mm (95%CI: 0.33-0.71mm), to MT BB , MT TB , MT RF and MT VL respectively. These values were calculated from the three images captured per site. Exercise training design Sixty-seven untrained subjects were randomized to one of two groups: Split Workout Routine (n=35), in which different muscle groups were trained twice weekly in an A/B split consisting of eight sets per session, or Full-Body Workout Routine (n=32), in which all muscle groups were trained four times weekly with four sets per session. Following technical familiarization, both groups completed four weekly sessions. The only difference between groups was the frequency with which each muscle group was trained. Split Workout Routine training comprised an ‘A’ (Mondays and Thursdays) and a ‘B’ (Tuesdays and Fridays) session. The A session consisted of bench press, inclined bench press, cable triceps pushdown, triceps kickback, shoulder press and front dumbbell raise. The B session consisted of seated row, lat pulldown, biceps curl, hammer curl, squat and leg curl. In contrast, the Full-Body Workout Routine trained each muscle group four times per week (Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays) with the following exercises: bench press, cable triceps pushdown, shoulder press, seated row, biceps curl, squat and leg curl. Subjects reported a rating of perception exertion of 9.5 to 10 for all sets and exercises across RT sessions based on the rating of perception exertion. ( 9 ) Specific Split Workout Routine and Full-Body Workout Routine programs are described in table 1 . Thumbnail Table 1 Training program design for Split Workout Routine and Full-Body Workout Routine All sessions were preceded by a specific warm-up consisting of one set of ten repetitions with 50% of the load used in the first set of each exercise. Subjects in both groups then executed eight to 12 RM per set. Subjects allocated to Split Workout Routine or Full-Body Workout Routine executed eight and four sets per muscle group respectively. Exercises were performed at no specific tempo, with a 60-second rest period between sets. Researchers supervised all training sessions and provided verbal encouragement to ensure the subjects executed the required number of sets and repetitions. The weekly- sets volume was equated between groups, attempts were made to progressively increase or decrease of the external loads lifted weekly to maintaining the target repetition range. Statistical analysis Normality and homogeneity of variances were tested using the Shapiro-Wilk test and the Levene test, respectively. Prior to analysis, data were log-transformed to reduce skewness resulting from non-uniformity of error (heteroscedasticity). Means±standard deviations (SD) and 95%CI were calculated following confirmation of data normality. Repeated measures analysis of variance (Anova) was used to compare 1RM BENCH PRESS , 1RM SQUAT , MT BB , MT TB , MT RF , MT VL and the effects of time (pre- versus post-intervention) between groups (Split Workout Routine versus Full-Body Workout Routine). Bonferroni post-hoc tests were then used to determine significant differences. Effect size (ES) was also estimated using partial eta squared (η 2 p ); <0.06, 0.06 to 0.14 and >0.14 indicated small, medium and large effect respectively. Effect size was expressed as the absolute difference (pre versus post) in the raw value of variables using the difference between two means in standardized units (Cohen’s d value). Cohen’s d values were qualitatively interpreted according to the following thresholds: <0.2, trivial; 0.2 to 0.6, small; 0.6 to 1.2, moderate; 1.2 to 2.0, large; 2.0 to 4.0, very large and >4.0, nearly perfect. Whenever 90% confidence intervals overlapped, small positive and negative values attributed to magnitude were deemed unclear. Otherwise, the magnitude was deemed to be the observed magnitude. Statistical analyses were conducted using (SPSS), version 22.0 software (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). The level of significance was set at p≤0.05. RESULTS Baseline measurements did not differ significantly (p>0.05) between groups. Cohen’s d values reported for all outcomes are shown in figure 1 are expressed as effect size ± 90% confidence interval for comparison of absolute differences between the raw value of variables. The grey area corresponds to trivial differences. Figure 1 Effect size differences (Cohen’s d) in maximal strength in bench press, squat and thickness of the biceps Brachii, triceps brachii , rectus femoris and vastus lateralis muscles between groups Maximal strength There was a significant main effect of time (F 1,31 =280.841; p<0.001; η 2 p =0.901) but no group-by-time interaction (F 1,31 =0.012; p=0.914; η 2 p =0.001) for 1RM BENCH PRESS .

Vastus lateralis MT increased significantly from baseline to post-intervention in both the Split Workout Routine (2.3mm; 12.1%; p=0.001; ES=0.51) and the Full-Body Workout Routine (2.1mm; 10.5%; p=0.001; ES=0.56) group. DISCUSSION Individuals in the Split Workout Routine and the Full-Body Workout Routine Groups experienced similar maximal strength gains from baseline to post-intervention. Changes in 1RM BENCH PRESS (18.1% and 17.5% for Split Workout Routine and Full-Body Workout Routine Group, respectively) and 1RM SQUAT (28.2% and 28.6% for Split Workout Routine and Full-Body Workout Routine Group, respectively) were almost identical. Effect sizes for 1RM BENCH PRESS (0.47 and 0.38 for Split Workout Routine and Full-Body Workout Routine Group, respectively) and 1RM SQUAT (0.92 and 0.82 for Split Workout Routine and Full-Body Workout Routine Group, respectively) were also very similar between groups. These findings are in keeping with the current body of literature. Research suggests strength gains derived from frequency manipulation are driven by the increase in training volume. When training volume is held constant, increased frequency does not seem to provide additional benefits. ( 10 ) However, most studies to date employed RT frequencies of 3 or fewer days per muscle group per week. Findings of this study add to the existing literature in that they show RT 4 days per week provides no additional strength gains relative to RT twice per week. Split Workout Routines are thought to enhance the ability to train at maximal effort level for a given intensity, generating higher muscle strain in a specific training session. ( 11 ) Such workout routines arguably facilitate recovery, since alternating between muscle groups allows more time for a given muscle to recover between training sessions. However, results of this study suggest Split Workout Routine training does not enhance muscle strength adaptations in untrained males compared to Full-Body Workout Routine training, provided volume and intensity are equal. Similar findings have been reported in prior studies with resistance-trained males. ( 12 , 13 ) With regard to hypertrophic adaptations, Split Workout Routine and Full-Body Workout Routine led to similar increases in upper and lower limb muscle mass. Volume is thought to be a major factor in hypertrophic adaptation. ( 14 , 15 ) Hence, these findings may have reflected equal total training volume in both workout routines. Results of this study are consistent with other studies comparing volume-equated muscle training with frequencies of least 2 days per week. ( 16 , 17 ) In the study conducted by Brigatto et al., ( 18 ) ultrasound measurements revealed no superior hypertrophic gains following training twice versus 4 times per week. Brigatto et al., ( 18 ) employed Split Workout Routines whereas our study compared a Split Workout Routine and Full-Body Workout Routine. Zaroni et al., ( 19 ) also compared the effects Split Workout Routine and Full-Body Workout Routine on neuromuscular adaptation in well-trained men over the course of eight weeks of training. In that study, muscle groups were trained once (Split) or five times (Total) per week and subjects executed the same exercises with similar repetition ranges each training week throughout the experimental period. Different from this study, higher weekly training frequency was associated with potentially higher hypertrophic effects in subjects submitted to a Split Workout Routine inwhich muscles were trained only once per week (in spite of equalized volume). However, the sample in that study comprised well-trained individuals (RT experience=2.4 to 6.4 years), which may in part explain outcome differences. Further studies comparing different RT frequencies are obviously needed for deeper understanding of the impact of training frequency on long-term muscle growth. Some limitations of this study must be pointed. The experimental period was limited to eight weeks without energy intake control. The gain in muscle strength in the present study was probably due to neural adaptations, mainly because to the characteristics of the subjects in the sample, who were untrained. In spite of significant muscle strength and hypertrophy gains in both groups, it is not clear whether prolonged training would have yielded different results. The MT measurements were made at the middle portion of the muscles. This region is often used as a proxy for overall growth of a given muscle. However, research suggests hypertrophy is a region-specific phenomenon and greater gains are sometimes detected at the proximal and distal aspects. ( 20 , 21 ) Finally, findings are specific to healthy male subjects and therefore cannot be generalized to other populations, including adolescents, women and elderly and trained individuals. Higher RT frequencies may not be as well tolerated by these individuals and may accelerate the onset of overtraining if combined with high training intensities. Future research is warranted to determine frequency-related responses to RT with energy intake monitoring as well as controled repetitions in this populations. Additionally, in our study the volume control was done by equalizing the number of sets in concordance with recommended in previously studies, ( 22 ) however, is possible consider that equalizing the total load lifted (number of series x number of repetitions x lifted load) could be promoted different outcomes, thus more studies should be conducted for further clarification. Findings of this study have important implications, as they may assist coaches and trainers in designing individualized training programs, which may enhance exercise adherence. Indeed, results presented suggest strength and conditioning professionals can choose between a wide variety of training frequencies in order to optimize muscle strength and hypertrophy for a given weekly volume. This study was designed to isolate the effects of frequency on muscular adaptation, while remaining workout variables were kept constant. Given the dose-response relationship between training volume and muscular adaptation, ( 15 , 23 ) higher training frequency may allow practitioners to handle greater volumes of training, which in turn may result in larger muscle strength and hypertrophy gains. Whether additional training volume resultant from higher training frequency would be ideal or excessive would be unique to each individual. Practical applications Split Workout Routine and Full-Body Workout Routine promoted similar gains in muscle strength and thickness in upper and lower limbs in untrained individuals. Both training strategies are equally effective in untrained individuals during the early phase of training (eight weeks). Findings of this study may enhance exercise adherence by tailoring training programs to individual needs. Strength and conditioning professionals can use a wide range of training frequencies to optimize muscle strength and hypertrophy for a given weekly training volume. CONCLUSION Split Workout Routine and Full-Body Workout Routine promoted similar gains in muscle strength and thickness in upper and lower limbs. These findings suggest both training strategies are equally effective in enhancing muscular adaptation in untrained individuals during the early phase of resistance training (eight weeks).

One variable of primary interest in this regard is RT frequency. Frequency can refer to the number of resistance training sessions performed in a given period of time, as well as to the number of times a specific muscle group is trained over a given period of time. Objective We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the effects of resistance training frequency on hypertrophic outcomes. Methods Studies were deemed eligible for inclusion if they met the following criteria: (1) were an experimental trial published in an English-language refereed journal; (2) directly compared different weekly resistance training frequencies in traditional dynamic exercise using coupled concentric and eccentric actions; (3) measured morphologic changes via biopsy, imaging, circumference, and/or densitometry; (4) had a minimum duration of 4\xa0weeks; and (5) used human participants without chronic disease or injury. A total of ten studies were identified that investigated RT frequency in accordance with the criteria outlined. Results Analysis using binary frequency as a predictor variable revealed a significant impact of training frequency on hypertrophy effect size ( P =\xa00.002), with higher frequency being associated with a greater effect size than lower frequency (0.49\xa0±\xa00.08 vs. 0.30\xa0±\xa00.07, respectively). Statistical analyses of studies investigating training session frequency when groups are matched for frequency of training per muscle group could not be carried out and reliable estimates could not be generated due to inadequate sample size. Conclusions When comparing studies that investigated training muscle groups between 1 to 3\xa0days per week on a volume-equated basis, the current body of evidence indicates that frequencies of training twice a week promote superior hypertrophic outcomes to once a week. It can therefore be inferred that the major muscle groups should be trained at least twice a week to maximize muscle growth; whether training a muscle group three times per week is superior to a twice-per-week protocol remains to be determined.

Marino 1 27k Accesses 104 Altmetric 6 Mentions Explore all metrics Abstract The popularity of resistance training has grown immensely over the past 25 years, with extensive research demonstrating that not only is resistance training an effective method to improve neuromuscular function, it can also be equally effective in maintaining or improving individual health status. However, designing a resistance training programme is a complex process that incorporates several acute programme variables and key training principles. The effectiveness of a resistance training programme to achieve a specific training outcome (i.e. muscular endurance, hypertrophy, maximal strength, or power) depends on manipulation of the acute programme variables, these include: (i) muscle action; (ii) loading and volume; (iii) exercise selection and order; (iv) rest periods; (v) repetition velocity; and (vi) frequency. Ultimately, it is the acute programme variables, all of which affect the degree of the resistance training stimuli, that determine the magnitude to which the neuromuscular, neuroendocrine and musculoskeletal systems adapt to both acute and chronic resistance exercise. This article reviews the available research that has examined the application of the acute programme variables and their influence on exercise performance and training adaptations. The concepts presented in this article represent an important approach to effective programme design. Therefore, it is essential for those involved with the prescription of resistance exercise (i.e. strength coaches, rehabilitation specialists, exercise physiologists) to acquire a fundamental understanding of the acute programme variables and the importance of their practical application in programme design.

The final analysis comprised 34 treatment groups from 15 studies. Outcomes for weekly sets as a continuous variable showed a significant effect of volume on changes in muscle size ( P = 0.002). Each additional set was associated with an increase in effect size (ES) of 0.023 corresponding to an increase in the percentage gain by 0.37%. Outcomes for weekly sets categorised as lower or higher within each study showed a significant effect of volume on changes in muscle size ( P = 0.03); the ES difference between higher and lower volumes was 0.241, which equated to a percentage gain difference of 3.9%. Outcomes for weekly sets as a three-level categorical variable (<5, 5–9 and 10+ per muscle) showed a trend for an effect of weekly sets ( P = 0.074). The findings indicate a graded dose-response relationship whereby increases in RT volume produce greater gains in muscle hypertrophy.

Searches were conducted in PubMed, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library from database inception until 10 May 2018 for original articles assessing the effects of RT on muscle size after interventions of more than 2 weeks of duration. Specifically, we obtain the variables fat-free mass (FMM), lean muscle mass (LMM) and skeletal muscle mass (SMM). The effects on outcomes were expressed as mean differences (MD) and a random-effects meta-analysis and meta-regressions determined covariates (age, weight, height, durations in weeks…) to explore the moderate effect related to the participants and characteristics of training. One hundred and eleven studies (158 groups, 1927 participants) reported on the effects of RT for muscle mass. RT significantly increased muscle mass (FFM+LMM+SMM; Δ1.53 kg; 95% CI [1.30, 1.76], p < 0.001; I 2 = 0%, p = 1.00). Considering the overall effects of the meta-regression, and taking into account the participants’ characteristics, none of the studied covariates explained any effect on changes in muscle mass. Regarding the training characteristics, the only significant variable that explained the variance of the hypertrophy was the sets per workout, showing a significant negative interaction (MD; estimate: 1.85, 95% CI [1.45, 2.25], p < 0.001; moderator: -0.03 95% CI [−0.05, −0.001] p = 0.04). In conclusion, RT has a significant effect on the improvement of hypertrophy (~1.5 kg). The excessive sets per workout affects negatively the muscle mass gain. Keywords: hypertrophy ; fat-free mass ; skeletal muscle mass ; lean muscle mass ; resistance training 1. Introduction Achieving a proper muscle mass is a key factor for sports performance as well as for attaining a good body image. Furthermore, muscle is increasingly being recognized as a key tissue for the maintenance of an adequate health status, not only regarding movement and posture but also as a regulator of inter-organ crosstalk for energy and protein metabolism throughout the body [ 1 ]. Therefore, improving lean body mass and preventing muscle loss should be crucial in promoting overall health and in achieving the targeted performance level [ 1 , 2 ]. In this context, being able to predict changes in body composition would be very useful for training and conditioning and for health professionals, both in the non-clinical and the clinical fields, helping them to set appropriate goals as well as to correctly assess the progression during interventions. However, despite its importance, several limitations arise regarding muscle hypertrophy, defined as an increase in the size of muscle tissue [ 3 ]. On the one hand, no consensus exists for quantifying this increase in muscle tissue, since different methods are employed to measure it (fat-free mass, lean muscle mass or skeletal muscle mass). On the other hand, another limitation for trainers and practitioners is that with current knowledge and research it is difficult to predict how much muscle mass can be gained. Several studies have already designed estimation equations to predict weight evolution throughout a weight loss programme [ 4 , 5 ], and although an intrinsic uncertainty and error margin of those estimations are always present, the same method of evaluation for muscle gain is necessary as we have already pointed out. In this sense, two pioneer works have paved the way to the prediction of muscle hypertrophy. Firstly, the meta-analysis by Morton et al. [ 6 ] has shown how supplementation can influence muscle hypertrophy, explicitly reporting the weight of this variable (i.e., supplementation) over the levels of muscle gain. Secondly, based on the models proposed by Hall et al. [ 5 ], Torres et al. created a mathematical model to predict muscle hypertrophy in humans. Nevertheless, the work by Morton et al. [ 6 ] focuses on the effect of protein intake on muscle gain, without addressing the effect of training without protein supplementation; while the model created by Torres et al. is a theoretical model focused on fat loss and lean mass gain in obese people, not determining the effect of the different training parameters. In fact, the authors declare that further models may be developed and redefined to include parameters they had not addressed [ 7 ]. Therefore, it seems that a really integrative model, taking into account all the variables that influence muscle hypertrophy, is currently lacking. In this respect, muscle hypertrophy in humans is influenced by numerous variables, from those inherent to exercise such as mechanical tension, metabolic stress, muscle damage, training volume and intensity [ 8 , 9 ]; to those being specific to the individual (age, sex, previous training status, etc.) [ 10 ], or those related to energy balance and protein metabolism [ 6 , 7 ]. Consequently, any study aiming to analyse and estimate muscle hypertrophy in humans must precisely address all confounding factors that may completely alter the final results. As mentioned above, only two studies have attempted to estimate the changes in muscle mass after a training intervention [ 6 , 7 ]. However, none of them handle the effect of these confounding factors that we have mentioned. Therefore, the effect of an isolated training programme on muscle hypertrophy, the variation in its design, age or resistance training (RT) experience, are currently unknown. Thus, the aims of the present study were: (i) to quantify the impact of strength training on human whole-body muscle hypertrophy, and (ii) to analyse training factors which could moderate the human muscle growth in men. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Study Design The methodological process was based on the recommendations indicated by the PRISMA declaration [ 11 ]. The eligibility criteria were established by the authors. For the meta-analysis, research that studied resistance training was considered. The study was preregistered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Review (PROSPERO) with the following registered number: CRD42018106274. 2.2. Data Sources and Search Profile A comprehensive literature search was performed using PubMed-Medline, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library from database inception through to 10 May 2018. The database searches were performed independently by two authors (P.J.B. and D.J.R.-C.) and the results obtained were the same. The following combination terms was used: “muscle hypertrophy” or “muscle thickness” or “muscle gain” or “fat free mass” or “muscular size” or “muscle size” or “skeletal muscle mass” or “appendicular skeletal muscle mass” or “muscle mass” or “body fat free”. The Boolean operator “AND” was used to combine these descriptors with: “resistance training” or “strength training” or “weight training” or “power training” or “weightlifting” or “full body” or “circuit*” or “neuromuscular training” or “body weight training”. Also, the Boolean operator “NOT” was combined with the terms “sarcopenia” or “atroph*” or “Review”. The flow diagram of the search process is shown in Figure 1 . Figure 1. Prisma flow diagram for the included studies. 2.3. Selection Criteria The specific inclusion criteria were: (1) studies examining the effect of RT from for at least 2 weeks to one year on lean body mass, skeletal muscle mass or fat-free mass; (2) participants were men; (3) studies published in English, and; (4) studies provide information of outcomes both at baseline and follow-up. Research studies were excluded if they: (1) used a sample population with pathologies or not between 18 and 40 years of age; (2) used men and women in the same group of training; (3) performed RT with a negative energy balance; (4) were a review or did not have an intervention design; (5) were not an original investigation published in full; (6) did not specify the tests to be evaluated or did not use a specific measurement of muscle mass in whole body; (7) applied gravitational weight training (i.e., elastic bands, pool resistance training, concurrent training, body vibrations…); (8) did not provide or specify numerical data; and, (9) they examined acute effects of interventions. 2.4. Study Selection and Data Extraction Retrieved articles were reviewed independently by two authors (P.J.B. and D.J.R.-C.), to choose potentially relevant articles; all disagreements on inclusion/exclusion were discussed and resolved by consensus. References of potentially relevant articles were also searched to find additional studies, and authors of selected studies were contacted for non-reported information. Two authors (P.J.B. and D.J.R.-C.) independently extracted data from the included studies. The following information was extracted: authors of the paper, study design, number of participants included in each group, training experience and training status, age, weight and height. Regarding the characteristics of the RT programmes, the information extracted included: the type of exercise (i.e., full body, circuit training, traditional split routine…), duration of training (weeks), training frequency (sessions/week), number of exercise performed each day, relative load lifted, sets and repetitions performed, rest between sets and between repetitions, total number of sessions, nutritional supplementation, drugs use and the outcomes measured (e.g., lean body mass, skeletal muscle mass or fat-free mass). 2.5. Outcomes The output variables of the articles were defined as follows. Fat-free mass (FMM) was calculated as “all that is not fat”, subtracting fat weight from body weight, or when the measurements were obtained by dual X-ray absorptiometry was calculated as lean tissue plus bone mineral content [ 12 ]. Lean muscle mass (LMM), lean mass, lean body mass, bone-free lean body mass or mineral-free lean mass was calculated as the fat-free mass minus the bone mineral content (DXA) or as fat-free mass minus the estimated weight [ 13 ] of the live bone by the equation of Heymsfield et al. [ 14 ]. Skeletal muscle mass (SMM) or skeletal muscle was defined as lean muscle and was calculated by anthropometric equations, by proprietary algorithms when using bioimpedance or by estimates based on dual X-ray absorptiometry data [ 15 ]. 2.6. Evaluation of the Methodology of the Studies Selected The methodological quality of the selected studies was assessed with the quality assessment tool for before−after (pre−post) studies with no control group tool  (National Heart Lung and Blood Institute, 2014), which analyses the following items: (1) study question; (2) eligibility criteria and study population; (3) study participants representative of clinical populations of interest; (4) all eligible participants enrolled; (5) sample size; (6) intervention clearly described; (7) outcome measures clearly described, valid, and reliable; (8) blinding of outcome assessors; (9) follow-up rate; (10) statistical analysis; (11) multiple outcome measures; and (12) group-level interventions and individual-level outcome efforts. For each study, each item was described as having either a low risk of bias, an unclear risk of bias or a high risk of bias. Risk of bias was assessed independently by two authors (P.J.B. and D.J.R.-C.) using the previously described risk of bias tool. 2.7. Data Synthesis and Statistical Analysis The meta-analysis and the statistical analysis were conducted using the Review Manager software (RevMan 5.2; Cochrane Collaboration, Oxford, UK). A random effects meta-analysis was conducted to determine the summary effect of RT on lean body mass, skeletal muscle mass or fat-free mass. The effects of training on these outcomes were expressed as mean differences (MD) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI). The heterogeneity between the studies was evaluated through the I 2 statistic, and between-study variance using the tau-square (Tau2) [ 16 ]. The I 2 values of 30−60% represented a moderate level of heterogeneity. A p value < 0.1 suggests the presence of substantial statistical heterogeneity. The publication bias was evaluated through an asymmetry test as estimated from a funnel plot ( Figure 2 ). In addition, the Egger’s test was used to assess publication bias. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Figure 2. Test for funnel plot asymmetry of the change of muscle mass (all variables measured: FFM, LMM, SMM) after resistance training. Effects of Moderator Variables: Meta-Regression and Sub-Analysis To explore the moderate effect related to the participants and characteristics of training, meta-regression and meta-analysis were performed. The continuous covariates were meta-regressed individually and together in a random-effects meta-regression model using Jamovi project (Package for R). The following prognostic factors were considered: average of age, weight, height, study durations (weeks), sessions, days per week, number of exercises per workout, rest between exercise, number of sets per workout, range repetitions, training duration (min) and average intensity (%1RM) and for training status the studies were coded according to the following structure: sedentary/untrained = 0; physically active but no experience in RT = 1; RT up to 1 year/intermediate = 2; RT experience up to 2 years/intermediate = 3; RT experience up to 3 years/intermediate = 4; RT experience of 4 years or more/advanced = 5. For the meta-regression, we used a residual restricted maximum likelihood to measure between-study variance (τ2). Factors found to be significant at p = 0.05 level were included in multivariate meta-regression models. In addition, the training status variable was considered to be a categorical variable and in order to do so the participants categorized as untrained were those described as untrained, without experience in RT or less than one year of experience with loads, and the participants with RT experience of more than one year were categorized as trained. Finally, subgroup analyses were used for the effects of/to find the effects of categorical variables (training status: untrained vs trained). 3. Results 3.1. General Characteristics of Studies The initial search, which was based on the effect of resistance training on muscle mass, identified 4056 articles from the databases and no articles from other sources. After removing the duplicates, 2671 abstracts were screened, 2173 were excluded and 498 were screened as full texts. Finally, 111 studies (see Supplementary Table S1 ) were determined to fulfil the inclusion criteria and thus selected for the meta-analysis ( Figure 1 ). Publications ranged from 1973 to 2018. The instruments used to carry out the measurements were anthropometry (n groups = 19), ultrasound (n groups = 1), Bod Pod (n groups = 3), bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) (n groups = 14), dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) (n groups = 35), hydrodensitometry, hydrostatic weighing and underwater weighing (n groups = 10) FFM; anthropometry (n groups = 4), BIA (n groups = 1), DXA (n groups = 48), underwater weighing (n groups = 12) for LMM and anthropometry (n groups = 8) and DXA (n groups = 3) for SMM. The main characteristics and properties of the included studies are summarized in Supplementary Table S1 . 3.1.1. The Participants’ Characteristics The initial search, which was based on the effect of resistance training on muscle mass, identified 111 articles (158 groups) and 1927 participants were measured (23.5 ± 3.31 years; 79.4 ± 6.42 kg and 177 ± 9.19 cm). Sixty-one studies (82 groups) analysed fat-free mass, 52 studies (65 groups) evaluated the lean muscle mass and seven studies (11 groups) examined the muscle mass to analyze the effects of a resistance training programme on muscle mass. Some of these studies measured more than one variable and the same study may be included in FFM, LMM or SMM (see Table 1 ). There were a total of 951 participants in fat-free mass (23.8 ± 3.40 years; 79.5 ± 6.36 kg and 178 ± 3.64 cm), 810 participants in lean body mass (23.2 ± 3.47 years; 80.4 ± 6.41 kg and 176 ± 1.40 cm) and 155 participants in muscle mass (23.0 ± 1.24 years; 73.5 ± 3.5 kg 179 ± 3.0 cm). The participants who carried out the intervention had a state of training between untrained to bodybuilder professionals; the frequency of each state was sedentary/untrained (n groups: FFM = 13; LMM = 3; SMM = 0); physically active without experience (n groups: FFM = 26; LMM = 13; SMM = 3); with experience in resistance training up to one year (n groups: FFM = 8; LMM = 14; SMM = 5); with experience 1−2 years (n groups: FFM = 8; LMM = 5; SMM = 0); with experience 2−4 years (n groups: FFM = 8; LMM = 6; SMM = 0); and with experience 4 years or more (n groups: FFM = 7; LMM = 0; SMM = 0). Table 1. Main differences between pre-post study in the main body composition variable considered. The numerical suffix after the references indicate the different subgroup in the same study. See supplemental material for more information. 3.1.2. The Resistance Training Characteristics The types of training performed were circuit training (n groups: FFM = 1; LMM = 2), full body (n groups: FFM = 40; LMM = 31; SMM = 4), traditional split routine (n groups: FFM = 34; LMM = 20; SMM = 7), lower limbs (n groups: LMM = 3), and physical military training (n groups: FFM = 2) and not specified (n groups: FFM = 5; LMM = 9) for FFM. The training sessions lasted from 4 to 24 weeks (FFM = 10.4 ± 5.41; LMM = 9.37 ± 4.53; SMM = 10.5 ± 4.01) with a weekly frequency of between 2 and 6 days (FFM = 3.5 ± 0.84; LMM = 3.2 ± 0.81; SMM = 3.3 ± 0.94). The resistance training sessions were carried out with between 1 and 20 exercises (FFM = 7.9 ± 3.13; LMM = 7.3 ± 3.67; SMM = 7.0 ± 1.48), 1 to 50 sets per exercise (FFM = 16.7 ± 11.8; LMM = 14.0 ± 10.1; SMM = 19.1 ± 11.1) and 2 to 15 repetitions per set (FFM = 7.8 ± 3.0; LMM = 9.1 ± 1.9; SMM = 8.5 ± 0.7) with intensities of 50 and 89% of 1RM (FFM = 78.8 ± 5.8; LMM = 74.6 ± 8.6; SMM = 80.8 ± 5.8). 3.2. Heterogeneity and Risk of Bias Risk-of-bias assessment is shown in Figure 2 . Overall, the risk of bias was low in the studies, the overall median scores were high, 10/12 points. In addition, heterogeneity was not found for changes in hypertrophy for overall effects (Z= −0.078; p = 0.94). In addition, heterogeneity was not observed when studies were divided according to FFM (Z= −0.003; p = 0.99); LMM (Z = −0.25, p = 0.80) and SMM (Z = −0.58, p = 0.56). 3.3. Meta-Analyses 3.3.1. Effects of Training on Hypertrophy The results of the overall effects on muscle mass (FFM + LMM + SMM) before and after the resistance training programme showed significant improvement between pre- and post-test (n participants = 1916; 1.53 kg 95% CI [1.30, 1.76], p < 0.001; I 2 = 0%, p = 1.00). 3.3.2. Subgroup Analysis RT evoked a significant increase of FFM (1.56 kg 95% CI [1.23, 1.89]), of LMM (1.65 kg 95% CI [1.28, 2.01]) and of SMM (1.11 kg 95% CI [0.52, 1.71]) ( Table 1 ). However, non-significant differences were observed between the different variables used to describe hypertrophy used. When the studies were divided using the training status of participants, non- significant differences were observed between trained and untrained participants after the resistance training programme ( Figure 3 ). However, when comparing pre−post intervention results for each way of measuring hypertrophy, both groups present significant increases for FFM (untrained: 1.54 kg 95% CI [1.12, 1.96], trained: 0.98 kg 95% CI [0.17, 1.79]), for LMM (untrained: 1.70 kg 95% CI [1.04, 2.36], trained: 1.09 kg 95% CI [0.36, 1.81]), except for the SMM (untrained: 1.22 kg 95% CI [0.38, 2.06], trained: 0.66 kg 95% CI [−0.39, 1.72]). Figure 3. Mean differences exploration comparing the training effect. Performing a more detailed analysis of the training status on FFM, we found that the categories sedentary/untrained and physically active but no experience in RT, have higher and more significant values than the moderately trained (RT up to 1 year/intermediate, RT experience up to 2 years/intermediate, and RT experience up to 3 years/intermediate). Additionally, the highest values achieved are those obtained by the more experienced subjects, RT experience of 4 years or more/advanced (see Figure 4 ). However, no statistically significant differences between categories were observed (χ² = 5.79; p = 0.33). Figure 4. Mean differences exploration comparing the training status by categories. Sedentary = 0: 1.39 kg 95% CI [0.89, 1.90], p < 0.001; I 2 = 0%, p = 0.89; untrained = 1: 1.92 kg 95% CI [1.05, 2.78], p < 0.001; I 2 = 0%, p = 1.00; Up to one year experience = 2: 1.39 kg 95% CI [−0.35, 3.12], p = 0.12; I 2 = 0%, p = 1.00; Up to two year experience = 3: 0.69 kg 95% CI [−0.39, 1.76], p =0.21; I 2 = 0%, p = 1.00; Up to tree year experience = 4: 0.9 kg 95% CI [−1.28, 3.09], p = 0.42; I 2 = 0%, p = 1.00; RT experience of 4 years or more = 5: 2.96 kg 95% CI [1.06, 4.87], p = 0.002; I 2 = 41%, p = 0.08. 3.4. Meta-Regression The results from the meta-regression model are presented in Table 2 . Considering the overall effects, and taking into account the participant characteristics, none of our covariates explained any effect on changes in muscle mass. Regarding the training characteristics, the only significant variable that explains the variance of the hypertrophy was the sets per workout, showing a significant negative interaction (MD; estimate: 1.85, 95% CI [1.45, 2.25], p < 0.001; moderator: −0.03 95% CI [−0.05, −0.00] p = 0.041). When the effect of RT on changes in hypertrophy was evaluated with muscle mass assessment stratified into three subgroups (FFM, LMM and SMM) there were no covariates that explained any of the variance in the change in hypertrophy. Table 2. Metaregression analisys taking in to account de participants and training characteristics, at the begin the study. 4. Discussion The main finding of the present study is that RT significantly increases muscle mass, in average (FFM = 1.56/LMM = 1.65/SMM = 1.11 kg), by about 1.5 kg with a wide range of heterogeneity (from 0 to 7.2 kg). These results were obtained including studies with interventions durations ranging from 2 weeks to one year. The present meta-analysis is, to date, the largest in terms of RT interventions on full body muscle mass gain. Most meta-analyses that have analysed the effect of RT and characteristics of participants on muscle mass gains have only included works with protein supplementation [ 6 , 122 , 123 , 124 , 125 , 126 , 127 , 128 , 129 ] or have analysed single variables of the training load isolated, as for example, training frequency [ 130 , 131 , 132 ], intensity or training periodization [ 133 ]. This segmentation has meant that many of the works that have focused solely on these analyses have been left out. However, as stated by Morton et al. [ 6 ], performance of RT alone is the much more potent stimulus, accounting for a substantially greater portion of the variance in RT-induced gain in muscle mass. Therefore, in order to have the largest number of studies that met all the inclusion criteria, the meta-analyses should focus on the variables of the training or the characteristics of the participants that have the greatest effect on muscle mass. The most important findings are that RT is an effective method to develop hypertrophy, regardless of the variable used to quantify it, as well as the training characteristics (intensity, volume, weekly training frequency, etc.), with significant increases of 1.6 kg in FFM; of 1.7 kg in LMM; and 1.1 kg in muscle mass (MM). These results are slightly higher than those found in the meta-regression of Morton et al. [ 6 ], increasing 1.1 kg of FFM when supplementation is not included and 1.4 kg in the FFM when supplementation is included. This may be due to the fact that only studies including intervention with nutritional supplements were considered in Morton’s work, and that the no-supplementation results were derived from the control groups of these studies. This considerably reduced their sample and may explain their possible underestimation of muscle mass. On the other hand, although there is no clear moderating factor, it is observed that there are certain variables such as the training status (the untrained have greater gains in hypertrophy), as well as other variables related to the training load, mainly the number of sets per workout, which explain a greater gain in this variable when the number is relatively low, always within a threshold. However, due to the lack of explanation of the variance from the variables of the training load analyzed, it has not been possible to fulfil the objective of creating a mathematical model for the estimation of the level of human muscle hypertrophy in men. 4.1. Participant Characteristics Regarding the characteristics of the participants, no variable has been shown to moderate gains in hypertrophy. It should be noted that a decrease in hypertrophy has traditionally been associated with age. In the present meta-analysis, it has been shown that, regardless of the technique used to estimate muscle hypertrophy, age does not have a moderating component on it. These results are as expected, as the included studies focused only on participants between 18 and 40 years old. In humans, sarcopenia (i.e., loss of muscle mass and function) affects individuals from approximately the 4th decade of life [ 134 ], with a decrease of 30–50% in skeletal muscle mass and function by the time individuals reach approximately 80 years of age [ 135 ]. For instance, Morton et al.’s [ 6 ] study found that RT in addition of protein supplementation is more effective at improving FFM in young or resistance-trained individuals than in older or untrained individuals. It is clear that older individuals are anabolically resistant [ 136 ]; however, according to the current meta-analysis, it seems that RT induces similar gains in muscle mass, independently of the age of the participant, when considering individuals from 18 to 40 years old. In any case, future studies are needed in which it is analyzed whether the gains of muscle mass after RT are dependent on the age of the participants of said programmes, including in those studies that have a sample with a wide age range. Furthermore, in relation to the initial level of the participants (training status) we observed the shorter the experience in RT of the athlete is, the higher the hypertrophy gains are, except for those with an experience of 4 years or more ( Figure 4 ). We believe that the reasons for the similar improvements in sedentary and advanced subjects are due to different reasons. In the case of sedentary or lightly trained it is probably the lack of previous stimulus that causes greater hypertrophy. These results are in line with different studies that have shown that hypertrophic responses to RT have been shown to diminish over time [ 137 ], in addition to hypertrophic potential being lower in well-trained strength athletes [ 138 ]. However, regarding the most advanced practitioners our results are quite surprising. It seems that once an experience threshold of approximately 4 years is surpassed the ability to hypertrophy increase. We hypothesise that this might be due to a more advance knowledge about training methodologies, higher level of adherence to the RT sessions, greater motivation toward training [ 139 ], a better exercises technique or even or the use of undeclared anabolic steroids. However, more studies elucidating the factors (behavioural, physiological or other) responsible for this are needed. Finally, from these results we can recommend that if we want high gains in hypertrophy with intermediate trained participants, we will have to be very precise in the design and establishment of the appropriate training load, as well as in the nutritional strategies necessary for an optimal anabolic balance of athletes [ 6 ]. Therefore, the previous state of training is a decisive variable in the potential gain of muscle mass. If analysed as a dichotomous variable (trained/untrained, Figure 3 ), the result is different to that of making a more detailed analysis taking into account several categories of experience ( Figure 4 ). In any case, the relationship between hypertrophy and the training status does not seem linear. It should also be remembered that one possible explanation for this is that there are not enough studies with intermediate training states. Finally, only men were included in the present study because the ability to hypertrophy is very different depending on the sex [ 10 ]. In addition, several studies suggest that the menstrual cycle can influence muscle mass improvements [ 140 , 141 ]. 4.2. Training Characteristics With respect to the training characteristics the only variable that seems to have a significant moderating effect is the number of series per session, being its moderator coefficient negative (−0.03; p = 0.04). This suggests that a high number of series per session could negatively affect muscle mass gains. This finding is in line with those by Schoenfeld et al. [ 130 , 132 ] showing that when equaling volume, greater hypertrophy was observed in those groups that distributed the sets with a higher weekly frequency (2−3 days) per muscle group. Contrary to these results (ours and previous) there is a meta-analysis supporting the efficacy of greater exercise volume [ 142 ], concluding that individuals interested in achieving maximal hypertrophy should perform a minimum of 2–3 sets per exercise, and that possibly 4–6 sets could give even a greater response; yet still, considerable heterogeneity was present in the analysis [ 143 ], and the only significant difference was observed when comparing one set with three sets. Nevertheless, even if a minimum number of series seems to be necessary to maximise muscle hypertrophy [ 144 ] there also appears to be a threshold by which the increase in the sets of exercise performed per muscle group within a given training session does not necessarily lead to greater muscle growth [ 144 , 145 ]. Thus, when designing a RT programme aiming to increase muscle mass it is not recommended to include an excessively high number of sets, such as that found in this study (16 sets per session on average). Similar recommendations have recently been proposed in a narrative review suggesting that despite increasing the number sets per exercise (albeit the majority of studies within RT literature focus on number of sets), it is likely more beneficial to increase the training frequency [ 145 ]. Therefore, future analyses are necessary in which all the variables related to the training load are stratified so that they can give us an idea of which is the optimal dose. Consequently, although we observed an influence of number of sets over the quantity of muscle hypertrophy developed, more studies are needed. However, perhaps the methods used so far for the muscle hypertrophy may not be sensitive enough to predict which variable and to what extent said variable can moderate greater gains in the development of hypertrophy. 5. Conclusions In conclusion, resistance training has a significant effect on the improvement of hypertrophy, regardless of the method used to quantify it. The improvements ranged from 1.6 kg in FFM, 1.7 kg in LMM, to 1.1 kg in MM. Regarding the characteristics of the participants, there are no variables (neither the age, nor the training status of the participants) that moderate the gains in hypertrophy. In addition, with respect to the characteristics of the training, the only single variable that moderates inversely the gains in hypertrophy is the number of sets per workout, showing that an excess of sets per workouts affects negatively the amount of muscle growth. 6. Limitations As mentioned earlier, RT has a long and significant effect on the development of hypertrophy. However, these gains were different depending on the variable used as the equivalent of muscle hypertrophy. Clearly, the methodologies used differ from each other, finding a non-significant difference of 45.6−54.6% when comparing hypertrophy by means of FFM and LMM versus MM. In the context of body composition and muscle hypertrophy, it is important to be very clear about what these two concepts mean and how they are measured as variables. Ideally, muscle mass should be measured isolated from the rest of the tissues, but this can only be achieved by using nuclear magnetic resonance and most of the studies do not utilize this method. Therefore, very few studies assess muscle mass as an isolated variable from the rest of the tissues and/or provide the value for the whole-body muscle mass [ 13 , 15 , 146 ]. The methodology of assessment could be a limitation, given that the measurement techniques (i.e., DXA, bioimpedance, etc.) of each study are different. However, previous studies have reported that these differences are not significant [ 147 ], supporting the comparison made in the present work. In addition, we need to keep in mind that many of the included studies did not specifically aimed to increase muscle mass, and therefore the heterogeneity of the results may be due to the different methodologies employed. Nevertheless, the purpose of our study was to define the range of muscle mass growths that can be expected after a RT intervention, even if the main purpose of the programmes was not muscle hypertrophy. Finally, the lack of heterogeneity in the variance of the studies include in the present meta-analysis, the different purposes and outcomes expected by the studies included, and poor description of training variables may be limiting to the present meta-analysis and meta-regression.

Copy URL Share a link Share on Email Facebook x LinkedIn Reddit Wechat ABSTRACT Endurance training induces a partial fast-to-slow muscle phenotype transformation and mitochondrial biogenesis but no growth. In contrast, resistance training mainly stimulates muscle protein synthesis resulting in hypertrophy. The aim of this study was to identify signaling events that may mediate the specific adaptations to these types of exercise. Isolated rat muscles were electrically stimulated with either high frequency (HFS; 6×10 repetitions of 3 s-bursts at 100 Hz to mimic resistance training) or low frequency (LFS; 3 h at 10 Hz to mimic endurance training). HFS significantly increased myofibrillar and sarcoplasmic protein synthesis 3 h after stimulation 5.3- and 2.7-fold, respectively. LFS had no significant effect on protein synthesis 3 h after stimulation but increased UCP3 mRNA 11.7-fold, whereas HFS had no significant effect on UCP3 mRNA. Only LFS increased AMPK phosphorylation significantly at Thr172 by ∼2-fold and increased PGC-1α protein to 1.3 times of control. LFS had no effect on PKB phosphorylation but reduced TSC2 phosphorylation at Thr1462 and deactivated translational regulators. In contrast, HFS acutely increased phosphorylation of PKB at Ser473 5.3-fold and the phosphorylation of TSC2, mTOR, GSK-3β at PKB-sensitive sites. HFS also caused a prolonged activation of the translational regulators p70 S6k, 4E-BP1, eIF-2B, and eEF2. These data suggest that a specific signaling response to LFS is a specific activation of the AMPK-PGC-1α signaling pathway which may explain some endurance training adaptations. HFS selectively activates the PKB-TSC2-mTOR cascade causing a prolonged activation of translational regulators, which is consistent with increased protein synthesis and muscle growth. We term this behavior the “AMPK-PKB switch.” We hypothesize that the AMPK-PKB switch is a mechanism that partially mediates specific adaptations to endurance and resistance training, respectively.

This article examines the experience of seven micro-finance programmes in Cameroon. The evidence indicates that micro-finance programmes which build social capital can indeed make a significant contribution to women’s empowerment. However, serious questions need to be asked about what sorts of norms, networks and associations are to be promoted, in whose interests, and how they can best contribute to empowerment, particularly for the poorest women. Where the complexities of power relations and inequality are ignored, reliance on social capital as a mechanism for reducing programme costs may undermine programme aims not only of empowerment but also of financial sustainability and poverty targeting.

In adult skeletal muscle, force results from the contraction of postmitotic, multinucleated myofibres of different contractile and metabolic properties. Myofibres can adapt to (patho-)physiological conditions of altered functional demand by radial growth, longitudinal growth, and regulation of fibre type functional gene modules. The adaptation’s specificity depends on the distinct molecular and cellular events triggered by unique combinations of conditional cues. In order to derive effective and tailored exercise prescriptions, it must be determined (1) which mechano-biological condition leads to what molecular/cellular response, and (2) how this molecular/cellular response relates to the structural, contractile, and metabolic adaptation. It follows that a thorough mechano-biological description of the loading condition is imperative. Unfortunately, the definition of (resistance) exercise conditions in the past and present literature is insufficient. It is classically limited to load magnitude, number of repetitions and sets, rest in-between sets, number of interventions/week, and training period. In this review, we show why the current description is insufficient, and identify new determinants of quantitative and/or qualitative effects on skeletal muscle with respect to resistance exercise in healthy, adult humans. These new mandatory determinants comprise the fractional and temporal distribution of the contraction modes per repetition, duration of one repetition, rest in-between repetitions, time under tension, muscular failure, range of motion, recovery time, and anatomical definition. We strongly recommend to standardise the design and description of all future resistance exercise investigations by using the herein proposed set of 13 mechano-biological determinants (classical and new ones).

Thirty-two untrained men [mean (SD) age 22.5 (5.8)\xa0years, height 178.3 (7.2)\xa0cm, body mass 77.8 (11.9)\xa0kg] participated in an 8-week progressive resistance-training program to investigate the ""strength–endurance continuum"". Subjects were divided into four groups: a low repetition group (Low Rep, n =9) performing 3–5 repetitions maximum (RM) for four sets of each exercise with 3\xa0min rest between sets and exercises, an intermediate repetition group (Int Rep, n =11) performing 9–11 RM for three sets with 2\xa0min rest, a high repetition group (High Rep, n =7) performing 20–28 RM for two sets with 1\xa0min rest, and a non-exercising control group (Con, n =5). Three exercises (leg press, squat, and knee extension) were performed 2\xa0days/week for the first 4\xa0weeks and 3\xa0days/week for the final 4\xa0weeks. Maximal strength [one repetition maximum, 1RM), local muscular endurance (maximal number of repetitions performed with 60% of 1RM), and various cardiorespiratory parameters (e.g., maximum oxygen consumption, pulmonary ventilation, maximal aerobic power, time to exhaustion) were assessed at the beginning and end of the study. In addition, pre- and post-training muscle biopsy samples were analyzed for fiber-type composition, cross-sectional area, myosin heavy chain (MHC) content, and capillarization. Maximal strength improved significantly more for the Low Rep group compared to the other training groups, and the maximal number of repetitions at 60% 1RM improved the most for the High Rep group. In addition, maximal aerobic power and time to exhaustion significantly increased at the end of the study for only the High Rep group. All three major fiber types (types I, IIA, and IIB) hypertrophied for the Low Rep and Int Rep groups, whereas no significant increases were demonstrated for either the High Rep or Con groups. However, the percentage of type IIB fibers decreased, with a concomitant increase in IIAB fibers for all three resistance-trained groups. These fiber-type conversions were supported by a significant decrease in MHCIIb accompanied by a significant increase in MHCIIa. No significant changes in fiber-type composition were found in the control samples. Although all three training regimens resulted in similar fiber-type transformations (IIB to IIA), the low to intermediate repetition resistance-training programs induced a greater hypertrophic effect compared to the high repetition regimen. The High Rep group, however, appeared better adapted for submaximal, prolonged contractions, with significant increases after training in aerobic power and time to exhaustion. Thus, low and intermediate RM training appears to induce similar muscular adaptations, at least after short-term training in previously untrained subjects. Overall, however, these data demonstrate that both physical performance and the associated physiological adaptations are linked to the intensity and number of repetitions performed, and thus lend support to the ""strength–endurance continuum"".

Copy URL Share a link Share on Email Facebook x LinkedIn Reddit Wechat Abstract The mechanisms governing the increases in force production in response to short periods of strength training have yet to be fully elucidated. We examined whether muscle architectural adaptation was a contributing factor. Ultrasound imaging techniques were used to measure quadriceps muscle architecture at 17 sites in vivo in trained and untrained legs of men and women after 2.5 and 5 weeks of unilateral knee extension training, as well as in a nontraining control group. Despite increases in knee extensor strength of the trained and untrained (women only) legs, there were no changes in muscle thickness, fascicle angle, or fascicle length in any of the muscles tested. The moderate correlation between vastus lateralis thickness (middle site) and eccentric ( r = 0.55; P < 0.05) and concentric ( r = 0.46; P < 0.1) torque after, but not before, training is suggestive of neural rather than architectural adaptations predominating in the early phase of training.

The purpose of this paper therefore was to conduct a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials to compare the effects of low-load (≤60% 1 repetition maximum [RM]) versus high-load (≥65% 1 RM) training in enhancing post-exercise muscular adaptations. The strength analysis comprised 251 subjects and 32 effect sizes (ESs), nested within 20 treatment groups and 9 studies. The hypertrophy analysis comprised 191 subjects and 34 ESs, nested with 17 treatment groups and 8 studies. There was a trend for strength outcomes to be greater with high loads compared to low loads (difference = 1.07 ± 0.60; CI: −0.18, 2.32; p = 0.09). The mean ES for low loads was 1.23 ± 0.43 (CI: 0.32, 2.13). The mean ES for high loads was 2.30 ± 0.43 (CI: 1.41, 3.19). There was a trend for hypertrophy outcomes to be greater with high loads compared to low loads (difference = 0.43 ± 0.24; CI: −0.05, 0.92; p = 0.076). The mean ES for low loads was 0.39 ± 0.17 (CI: 0.05, 0.73). The mean ES for high loads was 0.82 ± 0.17 (CI: 0.49, 1.16). In conclusion, training with loads ≤50% 1 RM was found to promote substantial increases in muscle strength and hypertrophy in untrained individuals, but a trend was noted for superiority of heavy loading with respect to these outcome measures with null findings likely attributed to a relatively small number of studies on the topic.

Thayer 3 Show authors 512 Accesses 45 Altmetric 6 Mentions Explore all metrics Summary Skeletal muscle tissue is sensitive to the acute and chronic stresses associated with resistance training. These responses are influenced by the structure of resistance activity (i.e. frequency, load and recovery) as well as the training history of the individuals involved. There are histochemical and biochemical data which suggest that resistance training alters the expression of myosin heavy chains (MHCs). Specifically, chronic exposure to bodybuilding and power lifting type activity produces shifts towards the MHC I and IIb isoforms, respectively. However, it is not yet clear which training parameters trigger these differential expressions of MHC isoforms. Interestingly, many programmes undertaken by athletes appear to cause a shift towards the MHC I isoform. Increments in the cross-sectional area of muscle after resistance training can be primarily attributed to fibre hypertrophy. However, there may be an upper limit to this hypertrophy. Furthermore, significant fibre hypertrophy appears to follow the sequence of fast twitch fibre hypertrophy preceding slow twitch fibre hypertrophy. Whilst some indirect measures of fibre number in living humans suggest that there is no interindividual variation, postmortem evidence suggests that there is. There are also animal data arising from investigations using resistance training protocols which suggest that chronic exercise can increase fibre number. Furthermore, satellite cell activity has been linked to myotube formation in the human. However, other animal models (i.e. compensatory hypertrophy) do not support the notion of fibre hyperplasia. Even if hyperplasia does occur, its effect on the cross-sectional area of muscle appears to be small. Phosphagen and glycogen metabolism, whilst important during resistance activity appear not to normally limit the performance of resistance activity. Phosphagen and related enzyme adaptations are affected by the type, structure and duration of resistance training. Whilst endogenous glycogen reserves may be increased with prolonged training, typical isotonic training for less than 6 months does not seem to increase glycolytic enzyme activity. Lipid metabolism may be of some significance in bodybuilding type activity. Thus, not surprisingly, oxidative enzyme adaptations appear to be affected by the structure and perhaps the modality of resistance training. The dilution of mitochondrial volume and endogenous lipid densities appears mainly because of fibre hypertrophy. This is a preview of subscription content, log in via an institution to check access.

Exercise snacking, here defined as short bouts of sporadic [muscle-strengthening] exercise, is one such strategy designed to overcome typical participation barriers observed in older adults. This study examined the acceptability of exercise snacking amongst pre-frail older adults and explored the efficacy of this approach in improving physical function. Methods In this single group design, 21 pre-frail outpatients with mild-cognitive impairment were recruited from a UK memory clinic. To be eligible, participants were aged\u2009≥\u200965-years who scored 3–8 (inclusive) on the short physical performance battery (SPPB) and were not regularly engaging in sport or exercise. Participants completed a 28-day, twice daily, exercise snacking intervention, consisting of five muscle-strengthening exercises, with the aim being to complete as many repetitions as possible of each exercise in a minute. Acceptability of the intervention was measured quantitatively and qualitatively using a survey and topic guide informed by the Theoretical Framework of Acceptability. Pre- and post-intervention physical function was measured using the SPPB, timed up-and-go (TUG), and 60s standing balance and sit-to-stand tests. Results Eighteen participants provided follow-up data and showed 85% adherence to the exercise snacking intervention, measured as the proportion of all sessions completed out of a possible 56. Participants rated the intervention as highly acceptable (4.6/5) suggesting it supported their self-efficacy (4.3/5) was enjoyable (4.1/5) and had a low burden (2.1/5). Qualitative findings suggested the ease of use, flexibility of the programme, and perceived effectiveness was important, and particularly useful for non-exercisers. Changes in SPPB score (8(1) vs. 9(3), p\u2009<\u20090.01), TUG (11.32(4.02) vs. 9.18(5.25) seconds, p\u2009<\u20090.01) and in the 60-second sit-to-stand test (17\u2009±\u20095 vs. 23\u2009±\u20097 repetitions, p\u2009<\u20090.01) were seen between baseline and follow-up. Conclusions Exercise snacking is an acceptable and potentially efficacious format of exercise for pre-frail memory clinic attendees who are at heightened risk of falling and frailty. Large scale randomised controlled trials are required to confirm whether exercise snacking is effective in the short and long term.

Article Open access 04 October 2019 Background The prevalence of age associated physical and cognitive decline is markedly rising due to the ageing population and places an enormous strain on health and social care in the UK [ 1 ]. One facet of ageing for many older adults is a tendency towards physical frailty, which, among other things, is underpinned by a deterioration in muscle function. The estimated annual loss of muscle size is 0.5-1% per year, with muscle strength lost at 1–5% per year in older age, with this process starting anywhere between 45 and 60 years of age [ 2 , 3 ]. Eventually the continued loss of muscle strength results in the tasks of daily living becoming too physically strenuous to be managed safely, greatly increasing fall risk and compromising individuals’ ability to live independently [ 4 ]. In the UK, muscle weakness in and of itself is estimated to result in excess healthcare costs of £2.5\xa0billion annually [ 5 ], with the total annual cost of falling in the UK estimated at £4.4\xa0billion, including £1.1\xa0billion for social care [ 6 ]. Indeed, falls are the number one reason for hospitalisation in UK older adults, with at least 1 third of all community-dwelling people aged 65 years or older falling each year [ 7 ]. Older people with cognitive impairment are markedly more likely to have reduced physical function and strength, and ultimately a greater fall risk [ 8 , 9 ]. Up to a third of emergency hospital admissions occur in an older person with dementia, and of these admissions, over half are associated with a fall [ 10 ]. Finding ways to engage and support older adults identified as being at increased risk of falls to maintain or even improve their strength and balance will have enormous benefits for both the individuals and wider society. The recently published World Falls Guidelines stress that even in low-risk groups exercise interventions are to be recommended, but it is acknowledged that adherence is particularly challenging [ 11 ]. Maintaining strength and balance is key to protecting against a loss of mobility, retaining the confidence and ability to undergo aerobic physical activity and social engagement, and preventing further decline in health [ 7 , 12 ]. Progressive strength training is undisputedly the most effective countermeasure to age associated declines in muscle mass and function [ 13 ]. There is promising evidence that exercise programmes may improve the ability of people with dementia to perform activities of daily living [ 14 ]. The UK CMO recommends that older adults undertake exercise sessions (e.g., resistance training) to build muscle strength and balance on two days each week [ 15 ]. Recent data however suggests that only 12% of adults aged 65\u2009+\u2009and 5% aged 75\u2009+\u2009years meet these guidelines [ 16 ]. Research suggests that the most common barriers to exercise in older age groups include a perceived lack of time, expertise (i.e., for resistance training), poor access to facilities, low self-confidence for attending gym settings or fear of injury/falling [ 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 ]. Moreover, cognitive impairment is a potential barrier to engagement and adherence in exercise interventions. As such, there is a need for interventions that are accessible, and to which people can adhere to achieve at least the minimum required dose to promote improvements in functional capacity. Innovative but simple and inexpensive programmes such as homebased ‘exercise-snacking’ have been designed to overcome these barriers, while also providing the functional improvements that would benefit older adults. Exercise snacking is a mode of exercise that aims to have maximum impact on physical function at minimum ‘cost’ to the patient in terms of time, money and no requirement for specialist exercise facilities or equipment [ 21 , 22 ]. In other words, the exercise snacks, which are movements designed to increase muscle strength and balance, are to be performed in the home environment over very short periods of time that fit with the current lifestyle of the patient [ 23 ]. A novel format of home-based exercise-snacking was designed and refined by researchers at the University of Bath in an attempt to overcome key barriers to engagement of older adults in exercise, by providing a safe, effective, programme that requires no specialist equipment or membership of a gym [ 18 ]. Furthermore, the simplicity of the programme and ease of which it is implemented should help empower and boost the self-efficacy of older adults to undertake regular strength and balance exercise [ 24 ]. Key to the success of any [new] intervention is that it is centred around the specific needs of the target population [ 25 ]. Early indications are that this exercise snacking intervention is safe, beneficial and acceptable to healthy older adults recruited from the general population [ 21 ]. However, no research exists examining its potential in outpatient populations who present with increased risk, such as pre-frail older adults who attend a memory clinic. Understanding the perspectives of these target users on the usefulness and ease of implementation is an important first step in ensuring the programme maximises the chance of engaging and benefitting patients. Contemporary research postulates the construct of ‘acceptability’ to be multidimensional, covering elements such as whether a user finds a given intervention to be enjoyable, aligned to their values and identity, easy to understand; not burdensome or displacing of other positive aspects of their life; perceptively effective; and self-efficacy endorsing [ 26 , 27 ]. Additionally, best practice guidance on the development of health interventions recommends the understanding of the process variables derived to form a theoretical basis and logic model that examine the mechanisms of change or effect [ 28 ]. To this end, the present pilot study had two key aims: 1) to examine the acceptability of the exercise snacking intervention guided by the Theoretical Framework of Acceptability (TFA) and identify areas that may need to be improved to optimise it for attendees of a memory clinic. 2) to explore and characterise the potential impact of this intervention on the physical function for this population on outcomes relating to physical function, health, and exercise cognitions. Methods Study design This pilot study used a single group, pre-test-post-test design to assess the acceptability homebased ‘exercise snacking’ in older adult patients attending the memory clinic at the Research Institute for the Care of Older People (RICE) in Bath, UK. All participants were asked to undertake 28 days of twice daily exercise snacks, with baseline measures of physical and cognitive function, patient reported health, wellbeing, and psychological process outcomes relating to exercise behaviour, recorded on the day before the intervention and follow-up measures scheduled within 7-days of the final day of the intervention. The primary outcome of intervention acceptability was measured by self-report questionnaire, with participants also invited to participate in a qualitative interview of their experience of the intervention. Participants Outpatients attending the memory clinic at RICE who were identified as being potentially eligible to participate in the present pilot study were invited to participate by RICE gerontology clinicians. Interested individuals were referred to study staff, with clinicians taking no further roll in study procedures. Eligibility requirements were age\u2009>\u200965 years; diagnosed mild cognitive impairment only (Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) [ 29 ] score\u2009≥\u200920); mildly impaired physical function (Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) [ 30 ] score 3–8 but not scoring zero on any individual component of the test); ability to safely perform 28 consecutive days of homebased exercise snacking; have someone present in the house during exercise snacks who would be capable of calling for help in the event of an emergency; and not currently engaging in regular exercise or participating in another research study with measures or interventions that might interfere with the present study outcomes. Potential participants with contraindications to exercise or co-morbidity preventing participation in exercise (severe breathlessness, pain, psychosis, Parkinson’s, Dementia with Lewy Bodies, or other severe neurological disease), or current musculoskeletal condition that could be made worse through exercise were excluded from participation. The inclusion and exclusion criteria were assessed with a bespoke self-report health screen questionnaire, and eligible participants provided written informed consent. The protocol was approved by the National Health Service (NHS) South West – Frenchay Research Ethics Committee (Ref: 22/SW/0084), conducted in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as revised in 2000, and registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (Identifier: NCT05439252, 30/06/2022). All participants taking part in the study provided written informed consent. With intervention acceptability as a primary outcome measure, there is a lack of comparable literature to quantitatively estimate a required sample size in this population, given adherence rates to the exercise snacking intervention are yet to be established. As such, for reasons of pragmatism and a fixed duration of study funding, a target of 20 participants to complete follow-up measurements in a three-month testing window was set. Participants who had not adhered to the intervention were included within this target sample size, so long as they would attend follow-up assessment. This approach was taken in an attempt to avoid a withdrawal bias, i.e., only participants who adhered to the intervention returning for follow-up assessment thus positively skewing interpretation of intervention acceptability. A rolling recruitment strategy was employed whereby up to 10 extra participants could be recruited to replace participants who withdrew from the study and were not willing or able to attend follow-up assessments, provided there was sufficient time to enrol and complete follow-up assessments of the replacement participants in the three-month testing period. Assessments Intervention acceptability was assessed by a theoretical framework of acceptability questionnaire on participant experiences of exercise snacking completed at the follow-up assessment only. The seven domains (Affective attitude; Burden; Ethicality; Intervention Coherence; Opportunity Cost; Perceived effectiveness; and Self-efficacy) of the TFA along with overall acceptability were measured using an 8-item questionnaire [ 27 ]. An optional qualitative interview to gather further data on the participant’s experience of the exercise snacking intervention was offered to all participants. During eligibility screening, baseline characteristics were collected (Table 1 ), and participants completed a health screen questionnaire, the MMSE, and the SPPB. Height (Seca 213 stadiometer, Hamburg, DE) and weight (Seca 799 electronic scales, Hamburg, DE) were measured with participant’s shoes off, and their ability to safely perform exercise snacking was assessed by the trained research psychologist, using a subjective assessment of the participants’ stability and self-reported confidence of completing the assessment. At baseline and follow-up assessments, participants completed questionnaires on their attitude towards the benefits of exercise using the Multidimensional Outcome Expectancy for Exercise Questionnaire [ 31 ], self-confidence for exercise using the Barrier Self-efficacy Scale [ 32 ], and satisfaction of the psychological needs for autonomy competence and relatedness in an exercise context using the Psychological need satisfaction for exercise questionnaire [ 33 ]. The Patient Health Questionnaire [ 34 ] and Generalised Anxiety Disorder Assessment [ 35 ] were used to assess mental health, while general health and quality of life was measured using the Short Form Health Survey [ 36 ], the Subjective Vitality Scale [ 37 ], and the Life Satisfaction Scale [ 38 ]. Cognitive function was assessed with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment [ 39 ] and self-reported indices of frailty were assessed with the Groningen Frailty Index [ 40 ]. The questionnaires were administered by a research psychologist. Alongside the SPPB, physical function was also assessed by a 60-second sit-to-stand test, in which participants were instructed to complete as many repetitions as possible in 60\xa0s from a hard backed chair with seat height of 45\xa0cm. Participants were permitted to use their arms for balance, but not to use their arms to propel or push themselves out of the chair. To avoid any self-pacing, participants were positioned out of view of a clock and the researcher did not count the repetitions out loud. A single attempt was permitted, and rating of perceived exertion (RPE [ 41 ]) was taken immediately after the sit-to-stand test as a secondary measure of test difficulty to capture potential improvements in the event of number of repetitions reaching a physical ceiling for a given participant. As a further test of physical function, the Timed-Up-and-Go (TUG [ 42 ],) was attempted twice with the best effort reported. Maximum duration standing balance tests were attempted with feet in semi- and full tandem positions, followed by single leg balance assessment. Balance tests were capped at 60\xa0s, with up to two attempts per position and the best effort reported if the first attempt did not achieve the 60\xa0s of balancing [ 43 ]. To characterise habitual physical activity and assess intervention adherence, a wearable physical activity monitor (ActivPAL4, PAL Technologies ltd, Glasgow, UK) was worn on the thigh for the seven consecutive days after the baseline assessment. The device was mounted under an adhesive waterproof dressing so it could be worn continuously, including during water-based activity. Participants were provided with a pre-paid and addressed envelope in which to return the device following seven days of wear. Intervention The exercise snacking intervention consisted of five exercises, each performed for one minute interspersed with one minute of seated rest, with the aim being to complete as many repetitions as possible of each exercise in the given minute. The total length of each exercise ‘snack’ was therefore nine minutes. Participants were instructed to complete the exercises twice a day at home, and only to perform exercise snacks when there was someone else present in the home with capacity to call for help in the event of an emergency. The exercises were sit-to-stand from a chair, seated lateral arm raising to overhead, marching on the spot with high knees (aiming for thigh parallel to the floor), seated arm crossing from arms down by the sides to touching opposite shoulders, and seated calf raises. Participants were provided with a set of written and pictorial instructions on how to complete the exercises along with a logbook in which to record the number of sit-to-stand repetitions completed in each exercise snack, along with a rating of perceived exertion (1–10 scale) for the whole exercise snack. The logbook included space to record minor adverse events or notes from the participant, and clear instruction for reporting serious adverse events to study staff. This logbook was to be returned following the intervention to assess intervention adherence. See Additional file 1 for logbook with exercise instructions. Statistical analysis The primary outcome of acceptability of the exercise snacking intervention was assessed descriptively based on the scores from the TFA questionnaire, and qualitatively using framework analysis [ 44 ]. Distribution of continuous data from secondary functional outcome measures (60-second sit-to-stand, TUG, and standing balance tests) were assessed with Shapiro-Wilk normality test. The 60-second sit-to-stand data were normally distributed, so a paired T-test was used to assess differences between baseline and follow-up, and data presented as mean\u2009±\u2009standard deviation. The standing balance and TUG data were non-normally distributed, so along with SPPB data (considered to be interval level data in the present study), these were assessed for differences from baseline to follow-up assessment with Wilcoxon matched pairs signed rank test, and data reported as median (IQ range). P-values for physical function outcomes are presented for additional context as to the tests that are of interest for further exploration at larger scale and should not be interpreted as conclusive. For secondary outcome measures, standardised effect sizes were calculated (Cohen’s d z [ 45 ]), and classed as small (0.2), moderate (0.5), and large (0.8) according to Cohen [ 46 ]. Secondary outcomes of cognitive function, patient reported health, wellbeing, and psychological process outcomes relating to exercise behaviour are reported descriptively as mean\u2009±\u2009standard deviation. Statistical analysis performed using GraphPad Prism 9.5.0 for Windows (GraphPad Software, San Diego, California USA). Results Participant recruitment and retention Thirty-one participants who attended the memory clinic were screened for inclusion in the present pilot study, of which 21 were included in the study and provided baseline data. The reasons for exclusion at the screening stage are included in the flow diagram in Fig. 1 . Baseline characteristics of participants enrolled in the pilot study are displayed in Table 1 . Of these, 18 completed the intervention and provided follow-up outcome data (of which one participant attended the follow-up 14 days after the intervention due to illness). Fifteen participants elected to complete the post-study qualitative interview. Reasons for study withdrawal included one participant who experienced a family bereavement, one participant who could not attend follow-up assessment due to logistical issues, and another participant who tragically lost their life owing to an accident unrelated to the study, recorded as an unrelated serious adverse event. Two of the three withdrawals occurred within 28 days of the end of the study timeframe, thus it was not feasible to include replacement participants for these two participants.

Sixteen of the 18 participants returned their exercise snacking logbooks, which showed a reported adherence rate of 80% of all exercise snacks completed across the whole group. One participant elected to discontinue the exercise snacking intervention after one week but attended the follow-up assessment and the follow-up interview. Of the 15 participants who attempted 28 days of the intervention, reported adherence was 85%. Half of participants who returned their logbooks completed all exercise snacking sessions over the 28 days. Three accelerometers that were distributed at baseline (n\u2009=\u200921) were misplaced by participants and not returned to the research team, and a further three provided no data owing to technical faults with the device (n\u2009=\u20092) or were removed by the participant. Of the remaining 15 accelerometers, 11 returned complete seven days of valid data, and four had partially complete data (three with six days, and one with three days due to battery fault). Acceptability The quantitative scores indicated an overall acceptability rating from the exercise snacking intervention by completers of the study of 4.6 out of 5. The highest rated aspects of the TFA by study participants were self-efficacy (4.3) and affective response (4.1), followed by ethicality (3.9), coherence (3.8) and effectiveness (3.7). Burden (2.1) and opportunity cost (1.8) were scored low (scores closer to 1 represent a favourable appraisal), demonstrating strong all-round acceptability of the intervention. Similarly, the qualitative interviews indicated a generally positive view of the exercise snacking intervention and insight into some improvements that may enhance the acceptability further (Table 2 ). In sum, most participants found the programme simple to engage with and fit into their lives, enjoyed participating and recognised the benefits the programme was having on both their physical function and, for some, their mental and cognitive wellbeing, with many declaring confidence to keep up the exercise after the study. For more active participants the programme was considered tedious, while those with more severe cognitive impairment struggled to remember to do the programme every day. Table 2 Qualitative analysis organised using the theoretical framework of acceptability domains, with implications for future implementation Full size table Exploratory analysis of outcome data Changes were observed from baseline to follow-up for total SPPB score (8 (1) vs. 9 (3), p <\u20090.01, d z = 1.29), TUG (11.32 (4.02) vs. 9.18 (5.25) seconds, p <\u20090.01, d z = 0.77) and in the 60-second sit-to-stand test (17\u2009±\u20095 vs. 23\u2009±\u20097 repetitions, p <\u20090.01, d z = 0.74), with no significant difference in the RPE of the 60-second sit-to-stand tests (11 (3) vs. 12 (3), p =\u20090.36, d z = 0.22 ). Most participants reached 60-seconds in both baseline and follow-up assessments of semi- and tandem position balance tests, with no differences observed in median balance time between assessments. Single leg standing balance time on the left leg significantly increased (11.27 (16.83) vs. 20.33 (46.56) seconds, p <\u20090.01, d z = 0.61), with no change observed single leg standing on the right leg (18.15 (51.90) vs. 23.79 (34.78) seconds, p =\u20090.93, d z = -0.02).

Qualitative data from 15 of the 18 completers suggested that the simplicity of the exercises, and the short, simple to do nature of exercise snacking is a useful feature of this programme, with many non-exercising participants seeing value of continued practice of these exercises. Participants generally found the exercise snacking programme easy to implement, not burdensome, and worthwhile, and for participants who returned follow-up data we observed potential improvements in basic tests of physical function and single leg balance. Together, these findings offer encouragement for the utility of exercise snacking as an intervention for inactive, older adult, memory clinic attendees, with a large effect size for improvement in the SPPB ( d z = 1.29, and moderate effect sizes for improvements in the TUG and 60-second sit-to-stand ( d z = 0.77 and 0.74 respectively). In a short period, this simple programme has demonstrated improvements in physical function that for a given individual, would present as a positive step towards preventing falls and maintaining independence [ 7 , 12 , 47 ]. Indeed, seven of the 18 participants who completed follow up assessment scored\u2009>\u20099 on the SPPB after the intervention, effectively moving them out the ’frail or pre-frail’ categories on this metric [ 48 ]. It should be noted that such physical assessments may be subject to a learning effect [ 49 ], and no familiarisation with physical assessments was undertaken prior to baseline, which along with the lack of control group means caution should be exercised when interpreting these change scores and effect sizes. Self-reported adherence to the exercise snacking intervention was higher than in other exercise studies in people with cognitive impairment (80% of all participants who completed follow up assessment in the present study compared to typical adherence rates around 70%) [ 50 ]. Furthermore, while self-reported adherence could be subject to overestimation through social desirability bias, these data may represent an underestimate in adherence owing to participants forgetting to record completed exercise snacks in their logbooks (Table 2 ). Further studies would do well to deploy appropriate objective measures of capturing adherence, such as the recording of behaviour through technology. Other exercise trials targeting people with mild cognitive impairment have achieved similar improvements in TUG [ 51 ], and it is also encouraging that the increase in the sit-to-stand scores were similar to those previously observed implementing a similar exercise snacking intervention in healthy older adults (32% in present study ( d z = 1.29) vs. 31% observed previously ( Hedge’s g =\u20091.40) [ 21 ]). Based on our data, exercise snacking may be of particular benefit for those who express common barriers to engagement with more comprehensive exercise provision or formats (such as group-based classes and intensive instructor led interventions), and certainly act as a gateway programme to improve baseline strength and balance and self-efficacy for regular exercise. The process outcomes displayed in Table 3 indicate some of the psychological mechanisms underpinning exercise participation that may potentially be modified by an exercise snacking intervention, namely exercise competence and outcome expectancies [ 52 , 53 ]. Conversely, scores of other psychological needs and cognitions endorsed by self-determination and social cognitive theory did not change or went down (viz. barrier self-efficacy, autonomy and relatedness), suggesting that additional support may be beneficial for building lasting exercise behaviour change. Of course, given the single-group pilot nature of the present study this exercise snacking programme warrants further testing to evaluate its effectiveness, the processes of change, safety and long-term benefit. The results indicate several aspects of the protocol and intervention that warrant further consideration prior to full scale testing to improve acceptability, such as the need to develop adaptations of the snacking exercises to make them easier or more challenging as required, or making the logging and performance of exercise snacks simpler and more habitual (Table 2 ). Furthermore, given challenges in retrieving full data from both exercise logbooks and accelerometers, strategies to aid data collections in cognitively impaired participants requires careful planning and perhaps further patient and public involvement [ 54 ]. Consistent with the other evaluations of exercise snacking in general non-patient populations [ 55 ], the simple exercise snacking format appears more acceptable to those who do not currently do exercise and ‘tedious’ for those who engage in more physically activity generally. Accordingly, it is proposed that studies evaluating exercise snacking in older adult populations (or practitioners implementing it) target non or low exercisers as those most suited to requiring and receiving such a programme. Consideration of building in progression so that the level of difficulty within the snacking format can be tailored to individual capabilities and exercise experience is also warranted. Secondly, self-monitoring the snacking using logbooks, while considered an important intervention ingredient, was problematic for some memory clinic patients who either forgot to do or log their exercise snacking sessions. Developing innovative yet intuitive ways to prompt the completion and recording of exercise snacks such as the use of digital technologies [ 56 ] or aligning to contextual habit-forming cues such as completing an exercise snack after a certain television programme has finished each day [ 57 ] may be useful developments of this protocol for those with cognitive impairment. Thirdly, although slight improvements in outcome expectancy was observed from baseline to follow-up, the qualitative acceptability data indicates more effort could be made to improve the rationale by which exercise helps minimise cognitive decline to increase engagement and adherence to the exercise snacking intervention. There are also several limitations with the study design that warrant consideration. It should be emphasised that the single-group design and lack of a non-exercise control group means that we cannot conclusively state the observed improvements in physical function were a product of the exercise snacking intervention. Whilst the SPPB and TUG are well established with reported reference ranges, the 60-second strength and balance tests used in the present study lack data on their validity and reliability. Furthermore, the present study lacks mechanistic data to explain what physiological adaptations might have contributed to a change in function, for example improved maximum force or power generating capacity [ 58 ]. Likewise, the small sample size and analysis of just completers of the intervention means that any statistical results should be interpreted as exploratory and not conclusive. The observed high retention rate, completeness and direction of outcome data and largely positive appraisal of the intervention rate suggest that the study was feasible, acceptable, and potentially efficacious for a pre-frail, mild cognitive impairment population. However, the demographic and health data suggests that the recruited population was fairly homogenous with all participants living in their own home, 20/21 being white British, and having high quality of life and life satisfaction and low depression and anxiety scores (Table 3 ). Whilst this is likely to be indicative of the population characteristics in the geographical area this study clinic is based, we cannot assume these findings generalise to the wider older adult population in the UK and beyond. The short intervention and lack of further follow-up measurements also means we cannot infer whether any observed changes to the physical function, health or process data, nor adherence to exercise snacking, were sustained in participants. Considering the findings of this study in light of these limitations, we conclude that the utilisation of a simple exercise snacking intervention could be an acceptable and beneficial way to improve the physical function of pre-frail memory clinic patients and warrants further evaluation to establish the efficacy of this approach. Whilst our data demonstrate an encouraging pattern of overall improvement in functional tests, this is not a robust study design to demonstrate efficacy of the intervention and further research employing a randomised controlled trial study design is required. Nonetheless, these initial findings suggest the exercise snacking format is acceptable, low burden, and engaging in this target population.

Fourth Advisor Casey Hart, Ph.D. Abstract Low perceived energy and a decline in cognitive performance throughout the day are common issues, though exercise and food consumption are suggested to improve mood and cognition. The present study compares effects of acute exercise to consuming sugar on mood, energy, and cognitive performance. Subjects underwent blood glucose testing, completed an Abbreviated Profile of Mood States Questionnaire, and Automated Operation Span (OSPAN) and Digit Span tests to measure memory and attention. On two separate days subjects consumed candy or walked on a treadmill for 10 minutes, then measurements were repeated at 30-min, 60-min, and 120-min post. Two-way ANOVA over time revealed significant condition over time effects for the maximum digits on the forward digit span ( p =0.034) and number of correct spans in the backward digit span ( p =0.023). There were no significant differences for OSPAN performance, mood or perceived energy ( p >0.05). This study indicates that though exercise and sugar have limited differences in their effects there is a need for greater research in this area.

However, long bouts of exercise have been linked to an increase in fatigue and pain level in elderly adults. Currently, there are very few investigations into the immediate effects of breaking exercise into shorter and frequent bouts, otherwise known as exercise snacking on physical fatigue, mood, and pain in elderly adults with KOA. The aim of this study was to investigate the immediate impact of exercise snacking versus continuous exercise on physical fatigue, mood, and pain level in elderly adults with KOA. Methods This was a randomized experimental study, with 37 participants aged 60\xa0years and above with KOA. Participants were recruited and randomly assigned into a five bouts of 2-min exercise snacking and 10-min continuous exercise groups, with the bicycle ergometer as the exercise mode. Physical fatigue, mood, and pain of participants were assessed at baseline and immediately after the exercise using Numerical Fatigue Rating Scale (NFRS), Visual Analog Mood Scale (VAMS), and Numerical Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) respectively. Descriptive statistics and inferential statistics of Wilcoxon Rank test, Mann–Whitney U , and ANCOVA were used to analyze the data with p value set at 0.05. Results There were significant differences ( p <\u20090.001) in physical fatigue, mood, and pain between baseline and post-intervention values within groups. Between-group comparisons revealed significant reductions in physical fatigue ( p <\u20090.001) and pain levels ( p =\u20090.048) in the exercise snacking group compared to the continuous exercise group. However, no significant between-group differences were found for mood. Conclusion Exercise snacking yielded significant improvements in physical fatigue and pain in elderly with KOA. However, both exercise snacking and continuous aerobic exercise were comparable in their immediate effects on mood in elderly adults with KOA.

Knee OA (KOA) is the most prevalent form of OA with a prevalence of 41% relative to hip OA (19%). Knee OA (KOA) is characterized by joint pain, stiffness, physical disability, fatigue, and reduced quality of life, which may contribute to a sedentary lifestyle, leading to further physical deconditioning and functional decline [ 2 , 3 ]. In Africa, the prevalence of KOA is reported to be 21% [ 4 ]. This indicates a significant burden of the condition in the population studied and highlights the need for appropriate management strategies to improve the quality of life of affected individuals. Although not as extensively researched as pain, fatigue is a common and significant symptom in OA and has been identified as a predictor of adverse outcomes, particularly in the elderly adult population with a strong association between fatigue and various aspects of physical and mental health [ 5 , 6 ]. Fatigue can impact cognitive function, mood, and sleep patterns, further contributing to the overall burden of the condition [ 6 ]. Therefore, it is crucial to consider fatigue as a significant symptom in OA, which requires appropriate management to enhance the overall well-being of individuals with the condition. It has been observed that pain, joint stiffness, functional limitations, sleeplessness, and fatigue in OA can have reciprocal effects on each other, leading to a negative impact on psychological well-being [ 5 , 7 ], and one of the potential negative effects of these symptoms is the development of depression [ 8 ]. Aerobic exercise has been shown to be an effective intervention for managing KOA symptoms, and it has positive effects on pain, disease severity, depressive symptoms, anxiety, quality of life, and functional performance in patients with KOA [ 9 , 10 , 11 ]. Additionally, a study found antidepressant effects from aerobic exercise training in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis [ 12 ]. In the KOA population, long bouts of exercise have been reported to increase fatigue and evidence showed that the physical activity of a 15-min bout led to increased symptoms of pain and fatigue immediately after the activity; however, these symptoms decreased over time [ 8 ]. Conversely, Fawole et al. [ 13 ], in a pilot quasi-experimental study, found that a 10-min short bout of moderate-intensity exercise on a treadmill had a negative impact on fatigue dimensions, including general, physical, and mental fatigue in people with KOA. In contrast, Idowu et al . [ 14 ] found that 10-min and 15-min exercises on bicycle ergometer are an effective intervention for reducing fatigue in a sample of KOA population. Exercise snacking is a form of physical activity that involves short bursts of exercise spread throughout the day [ 15 ]. Traditional exercise interventions typically involve sustained aerobic and resistance training which may require a significant time commitment and higher intensity levels compared to exercise snacking which involves shorter, more frequent bouts of physical activities that can be easily incorporated into daily routines [ 16 ]. This approach may offer a flexible and practical solution, particularly for elderly adults who may find prolonged or high-intensity exercise challenging due to reduced physical fitness, joint pain, and easy fatiguability. Age-related loss of muscle mass has been shown to be the most contributing factor to decline in muscular strength [ 17 ], and as a result, this can affect elderly adults’ ability to be physically active and perform activities such as continuous exercise routines. However, moderate intermittent exercise snack has been shown to be suited for elderly adults to enhance skeletal muscle mass and strength as compared to continuous exercise [ 15 ]. Exercise snacking enhances muscle mass and strength through frequent, low-volume stimuli that promote myofibrillar protein synthesis [ 18 , 19 ], which is particularly suitable for elderly adults with low physical fitness as compared to traditional continuous exercise which demands higher intensity and may not be feasible for all populations. Particularly for patients with KOA, exercise snacking offers the benefits of reducing joint strains, enhancing muscle strength, and reducing inflammation through improved circulation from short bouts of activity [ 16 ]. However, there is nascent evidence on the effect of exercise snacking on physical fatigue, mood, and pain in patients with KOA. Furthermore, the optimum duration of exercise snacking that will produce such a decrease in fatigue and pain and improve mood in the KOA population is yet to be determined. The study aims to investigate the immediate effects of 2-min exercise snacking versus 10-min continuous exercise on physical fatigue, pain, and mood in a population of elderly adults with KOA. We therefore hypothesize that there would be no significant difference between the effect of five bouts of 2-min exercise snacking versus continuous 10-min exercise on physical fatigue, pain, and mood in elderly adults with KOA (H0). Methods Participants' selection This study population comprised hospital-based elderly participants 60\xa0years and above, diagnosed by a physician with mild to moderate knee osteoarthritis based on the Kellegren and Lawrence grade I–III classification and using the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) classification [ 20 ]. The participants recruited had a baseline fatigue level\u2009≥\u20094 on a 0–10 scale using the Numerical Fatigue Rating Scale (NFRS) within the past 30\xa0days and symptomatic pain\u2009≥\u20094 on a 0–10 scale using the Numerical Pain Rating Scale (NPRS). Excluded from this study were individuals with neurological disorders and cardiopulmonary conditions, who had recently undergone a major surgery at least 3\xa0months ago, total knee replacement, or other conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, primary crystal arthritis, or other comorbidities like cancer. Outcome measures Primary outcome Physical fatigue Physical fatigue was measured using Numerical Fatigue Rating Scale (NFRS). Participants rated their perceived physical fatigue on a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 denoting “no fatigue” and 10 denoting “worst possible fatigue.” Prior study has shown a strong association between the fatigue levels assessed by the NFRS and other pertinent outcomes, like the SF-36 vitality domain, which have been used to establish the validity of the NFRS [ 21 ]. In a study conducted by Gladman et al. [ 22 ], the NFRS demonstrated strong test–retest reliability, as indicated by an Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) of 0.829 (95% CI, 0.697 to 0.907). It has been documented as a valid tool for assessing fatigue among elderly adults [ 23 ]. Secondary outcomes Mood Participant’s mood was assessed using Visual Analogue Mood Scale (VAMS). Participants self-reported their mood using 100-mm VAMS, a rapid and accurate method for assessing internal mood states. It was created in 1997 by Stern et al. [ 24 ] and has been applied in a number of studies and therapeutic settings. It evaluates eight distinct mood states, including fear, confusion, sadness, anger, vigor, fatigue, happiness, and tension. A significant correlation coefficient ( r =\u20090.52–0.72) between the VAMS and the Profile of Mood States (POMS) further supports the VAMS’s convergent validity [ 25 ]. Older persons can employ the VAMS as a valid and reliable assessment of mood states [ 26 ]. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the VAMS have a substantial correlation of 0.40–0.52, and the VAMS has shown good internal consistency in older individuals (=\u20090.71–0.84) [ 26 ]. Pain Pain was assessed with Numerical Pain Rating Scale (NPRS). Participants reported their perceived pain on a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 denoting “no pain” and 10 denoting “worst possible pain.” The validity and reliability of the NPRS have been extensively studied, and the scale has been shown to be a valid and reliable measure of pain intensity in various populations. The Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) was found to have strong correlations with other pain measures and was able to detect changes in pain intensity over time in patients with chronic pain [ 27 ]. Similarly, a study found that the NPRS exhibited good test–retest reliability in patients with chronic low back pain [ 28 ]. The NPRS has been used to determine the level of pain in osteoarthritis patients [ 29 , 30 , 31 ]. Physical activity level Physical activity was measured with International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short-Form (IPAQ-SF). Participants completed IPAQ-SF, a short-form version of the IPAQ developed by WHO used to determine the kinds and levels of physical activity that were a part of their regular routines over the course of the previous seven days. It consists of seven open-ended questions about the respondents’ most recent 7-day memories of their physical activity. According to the participants’ intensity levels, physical activity was divided into three general categories: high, moderate, and low. The psychometric qualities of the IPAQ-SF were examined by Kowalski et al. [ 32 ] in a sample of older individuals (65\xa0years and older). The IPAQ-SF showed strong test–retest reliability, according to the study, with a kappa coefficient of 0.61 for overall physical activity. The IPAQ-SF and measures of physical activity derived from the accelerometer to evaluate criteria validity showed only moderate associations, a pooled p -value of 0.30 (95% CI 0.23–0.36) [ 33 ]. Sampling techniques and sample size This was a randomized control study carried out at the Physiotherapy Department of the University of Benin Teaching Hospital (UBTH). It was a two-group experimental research study designed to investigate the immediate effects of exercise snacking versus continuous exercise. A purposive sampling method was used to recruit study participants and an independent person who was not involved in the study carried out a simple randomization to assign participants into two groups (a “five bouts of 2-min exercise snacking” versus “a single bout of continuous 10-min exercise”) using an online random number generator. The group allocations were concealed using opaque sealed envelopes. Sample size The sample size was determined using G*Power (version 3.1.9.4) using n\u2009=\u2009(2 * (Zα\u2009+\u2009Zβ) / d) ^ 2 for a two-sample t-test of independent means [ 34 ]. With inputs of α =\u20090.05, power\u2009=\u20090.80, and effect size ( d )\u2009=\u20090.80, the required sample size was 42 participants (21 per group). To account for a 10% attrition rate, the total sample size was increased to 46 participants (23 per group). Ethical consideration Ethical approval was obtained from the institutional health research ethics committee (Protocol number: ADM/E 22/VOL. VII/148301163) after which informed consent was also obtained from the participants. The study was also registered with the Pan African Clinical Trial Registry and the South African Medical Research Council with a unique identification number of PACTR202308724795310. Procedure for data collection All participants made use of Zero X-FIT exercise bike RM550 for the aerobic exercise. Socio-demographic details, such as age, sex, occupation, marital status, religion, and medical history, were obtained from the participants. Baseline data were collected from participants before the commencement of the study using validated questionnaires, including International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) for physical activity level, the Numerical fatigue rating scale (NFRS) and Numerical Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) for fatigue and pain levels respectively, and the Visual Analog Mood Scale (VAMS) for mood assessment. To eliminate bias, an independent person not involved in the project carried out a simple randomization of the participants into intervention group and control group using a computer random generator. The exercise snacking group underwent five bouts of 2-min exercise snacking using a Zero-X bicycle ergometer. After each 2-min exercise bout, participants rested for 2\xa0min in a seated position. This rest allowed recovery before the next bout. The continuous exercise group underwent 10\xa0min of continuous exercise with no rest period in between. The rate of perceived exertion (RPE) scale was used to ascertain the exercise intensity before and after the exercise protocol. Participants were briefed about the use of 0–10 RPE scale. The resistance and pedaling speed were adjusted prior to the start of the protocol to elicit moderate-intensity effort corresponding to an RPE of 4–6 (somewhat difficult) in both groups. At the end of the protocol, the control group underwent 10\xa0min of sitting (rest period) before leaving. This protocol was observed once, after which measurements of physical fatigue level using Numerical Fatigue Rating Scale (NFRS), pain level using Numerical Pain Rating Scale (NPRS), and mood using the visual mood scale were taken. Data analysis Data was analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows software (Version 26.0 Armonk, NY: IBM Corp). The distribution of the data was visually checked for normality using histogram and Shapiro–Wilk test. Data was summarized using mean or median, interquartile range, and frequency as appropriate. The difference between baseline and post physical fatigue, mood, and pain outcome variables were analyzed with the Wilcoxon Rank test as appropriate for the two exercise types. Mann–Whitney U was used to determine the significant difference between the immediate effect of five bouts of 2-min exercise snacking using a bicycle ergometer on physical fatigue, mood, and pain in older adults with KOA compared to the control group continuous 10-min exercise. Effect size (ES) was calculated using rank-biserial correlation [ 35 ]. Effect sizes were interpreted as\u2009<\u20090.3, low; 0.3–0.5, moderate; and\u2009>\u20090.5, high [ 36 ]. Within-group differences were presented as median (95% confidence interval (CI), and between-group differences in outcomes (intervention-baseline) between the two groups were compared using ANCOVA, with the respective baseline measures as covariates. Post hoc comparison was performed using the Bonferroni test. The alpha level was set at p <\u20090.05. Results A total of 41 participants with knee osteoarthritis (KOA) from the Physiotherapy Orthopaedic unit were assessed for eligibility, and 37 of them that were found eligible were recruited for the study as shown in Fig. 1 . Out of the 37 participants with KOA, 29.7% were males and 70.3% were females. Compared at baseline using the Mann–Whitney U test, there were no significant differences in socio-demographic variables across the two groups as seen in Table 1 .

However, there was no significant difference in mood scores as shown in Table 5 . Table 5 ANCOVA showing difference in post physical fatigue, mood, and pain scores between exercise snacking and continuous exercise while controlling for baseline scores Full size table As presented in Table 6 , a post hoc analysis using the Bonferroni test to assess changes in physical fatigue and pain levels indicated that individuals in the exercise snacking group experienced significantly more improved changes in their physical fatigue and pain scores compared to those in the continuous group p =\u20090.001 and p =\u20090.008, respectively. Table 6 Post hoc comparisons among exercise snacking and continuous group with Bonferroni test Full size table Discussion The purpose of this study was to determine the immediate effect of 2-min exercise snacking on physical fatigue, mood, and pain in elderly adults with knee osteoarthritis (KOA). The findings of this study revealed that there was a significant difference in physical fatigue, pain, and mood between the 2-min exercise snacking group and the continuous exercise group. However, between groups, exercise snacking had a significant reduction in physical fatigue and pain level as compared to the continuous exercise group, but there was no significant difference in mood. There were more female participants in this study than male participants. This is consistent with other studies that found that women were more likely than men to have KOA [ 1 , 4 , 37 , 38 ]. The low participation rate of men in our study may be attributed to socio-cultural factors and potential higher pain tolerance in men [ 39 ]. The findings of the study showed that 2-min bouts of exercise snacking using a bicycle ergometer led to a significant reduction in fatigue levels in elderly adults with KOA. Exercise snacking is a strategy that is gaining popularity among exercise experts for various conditions [ 15 ]. Impaired muscle leg strength has been associated with poor performance and reduced functional status in patients with KOA [ 40 ]. The findings of Perkins et al. [ 15 ] can be applicable to this population of elderly adults where exercise snacking using bicycle ergometry can lead to an increase in leg muscle strength which can lead to better performance of activities of daily living and can generally lead to improvement in their functional status. Exercise snacking enhances muscle mass and strength through frequent, low-volume stimuli that promote myofibrillar protein synthesis [ 18 , 19 ], which is suitable for elderly adults with low physical fitness. In elderly adults with KOA, exercise snacking offers the benefits of reducing joint strains, enhancing muscle strength, and reducing inflammation through improved circulation from short bouts of activity [ 16 ]. The finding of this study has indicated that exercise snacking of five bouts of 2-min exercise had a significant decrease (38.46%) in physical fatigue compared to 10-min continuous exercise with a 16.67% increase in physical fatigue [ 41 ]. This corroborates findings from a study conducted by Fawole et al. [ 13 ] who found that 10-min short bout of moderate-intensity exercise on a treadmill had a negative impact on physical fatigue. In contrast, Idowu et al. [ 14 ] found that 10\xa0min of bicycle ergometer is an effective intervention for reducing fatigue in a sample of general KOA population. The contrasting results may be a result of the population sample, due to the fact that elderly adults were recruited for this study compared to the general adults’ population by Idowu et al. [ 14 ]. Also, the study by Idowu et al. [ 14 ]. comprised of multiple fatigue domains aside from physical fatigue while the focus of this study was mainly on physical fatigue. Longer bouts of exercise have been observed to initially increase fatigue in individuals with KOA. However, subsequent findings indicated a positive outcome, with a reduction in fatigue the following day [ 8 ]. This study shows that patients with KOA may experience more significant improvement in their physical fatigue symptoms when they engage in shorter bouts of exercise. The finding of this study also showed that the rate of perceived exertion (RPE) after 10-min continuous exercise was significantly higher than in the exercise snacking group. The high RPE exertion in the 10-min continuous group can be linked to significant stress on the muscles of the lower limb, cardiovascular system, and other physiological systems which contributed to an increase in the fatigue level, which supports the finding of Pind et al. [ 42 ] which shows that increase in RPE can be a predictor of fatigue. The findings of this study revealed that both the 2-min exercise snacking group and the 10-min continuous exercise group led to significant improvements in mood, with participants experiencing a more positive mood from baseline to post-intervention. However, the exercise snacking group shows a greater improvement, with a 58.33% increase in positive mood compared to 50% in the continuous exercise group. These results align with previous research suggesting that aerobic exercise enhances psychological well-being, including mood improvement [ 43 , 44 ]. Hoffman and Hoffman [ 45 ] similarly reported immediate mood enhancements in individuals with knee osteoarthritis (KOA) following a single aerobic exercise session, attributing this to the exercise-induced analgesic effect. Additionally, Warburton et al. [ 46 ] noted that exercise typically elicits positive sensations, resulting in improved mood compared to no exercise. The findings of this study showed that either 2-min exercise snacks or 10\xa0min of continuous exercise have a significant immediate reduction in the amount of pain experienced at baseline to post-intervention, with the exercise snacking group showing a greater improvement, with a 42.86% increase in pain reduction as compared to 28.57% in the continuous exercise group. This phenomenon can be a result of the short breaks in between exercises which can reduce fatigue and lead to more energy level in the participants. Bicycle ergometry has been proven to be an effective tool in improving pain symptoms and increasing functional status in individuals with KOA [ 47 , 48 ]. The mechanism behind this is a result of repeated compression and release of the articular cartilage during pedalling movements, which is thought to be the physiological basis for stationary cycling’s pain-relieving effects [ 49 ]. The findings of our study showed agreement with prior studies [ 14 , 50 , 51 ], which have documented the benefits of exercise in reducing pain and improving function in patients with KOA. However, there was a significant difference in pain intensity between the exercise snacking group and the continuous group after intervention. The present study demonstrated that 2-min exercise snacking or 10-min continuous aerobic exercise have significant differences in the fatigue and pain difference change outcome post-intervention in elderly adults with KOA, after baseline pain and fatigue levels were controlled. However, after controlling for baseline mood scores, there was no significant difference in the mood difference. Further results showed that individuals in the exercise snacking group had a more pronounced reduction in fatigue and pain levels after controlling for baseline fatigue level compared to the continuous snacking group. The more pronounced reduction in fatigue and pain levels observed in the exercise snacking group, even after controlling for baseline fatigue levels, could be attributed to the intermittent nature of exercise snacking which could be beneficial in preventing prolonged muscular strain and mental exhaustion that might occur during continuous exercise sessions. Participant fatigue may appear to decrease when they engage in short bursts of exercise because they may be better able to sustain their energy levels throughout the duration of the exercise. Furthermore, participants’ perceptions of pain may be affected by the psychological component of dividing the total exercise plan into manageable shorter bouts which can lead them to perceive the activity as less painful and more manageable. The result of this study deduces that the observed improvement in physical fatigue, mood, and pain within the exercise snacking group was attributable to the immediate effects of moderate-to-vigorous bicycle ergometry exercise snacking. In contrast, the 10-min continuous exercise group experienced a notable increase in physical fatigue while experiencing a reduction in pain and improvement in mood. A recommended approach to address fatigue symptoms in elderly adults with KOA involves implementing short bursts of aerobic exercise with intervals of rest in between each exercise bout. This strategy not only offers the potential for improved monitoring but also holds promise for alleviating other symptoms associated with KOA. Exercise snacking as an emerging concept is thus beneficial for the immediate reduction of pain, fatigue, and improvement of mood in elderly adults; therefore, further studies to investigate its longer effects on these outcome measures in elderly adults with KOA are recommended. Conclusion Multiple bouts of 2-min exercise snacking yielded significant improvements in physical fatigue and pain in elderly patients with KOA. However, both exercise modalities were comparable in their immediate effects on mood in elderly adults with KOA. Limitation of study The immediate impact of the outcome measures in this study did not reflect the long-term effects of exercise snacking or continuous exercise on physical fatigue, pain, and mood in elderly adults with KOA. Also, the outcome parameters were determined using self-report measures, which could be subjected to recall biases such as over-reporting or under-reporting bias, and could not fully capture the complexity of the experience of physical fatigue, pain, and mood in the participants. Further study should also put into consideration comorbidities among these elderly adults as this can be a potential confounder in the result.

Written by Bronwyn Griffiths Originally published April 8, 2021 5:42 pm Workout Motivation Q&A/FAQ After those many hours spent running, rowing, and stretching our bodies into yoga poses, wouldn’t it be nice to know that we were also exercising our minds at the same time? Turns out, that not only can exercise improve your mood but it can also help enhance your memory and concentration. So, what exactly happens to our brains while we’re working out? We asked Sports & Exercise medicine professional and Brain Health entrepreneur Teemu Vornanen to give us the scientific low-down on how exercise affects the brain and what we can do to enhance our cognitive functions – both now and in the future. What happens to the brain when we exercise? Your brain is like plastic, in the sense that every stimulus/input can mold and reshape (i.e. rewire) your brain throughout your lifetime. We all know that when we exercise, our blood flow increases and often we start to feel more positive. In addition to these bodily sensations, studies have shown, interestingly, that exercise subconsciously affects our brain much more than this. Let’s start with a few of the key areas, to give you an idea of the bigger picture. Firstly, your brain is like plastic, in the sense that every stimulus/input can mold and reshape (i.e. rewire) your brain throughout your lifetime. At a neurobiological level, this rewiring comes from neurogenesis (the creation of new neurons/nerve cells) and neuroplasticity (the growth and improvements of neural networks). So, how are these processes affected by exercise? Well, scientists are mainly interested in four different levels of change that place in the brain. 1) Molecular and cellular changes are the key mechanism that mediates a broad range of neurotrophic (growth) factors. These include: Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF): a protein that promotes the growth of neurons. This is the brain’s natural fertilizer, affecting your learning, memory, and mental health. Insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1): a protein that works together with BDNF in learning processes. It also works with insulin to bring glucose to the brain. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF): a protein that stimulates the formation of blood vessels. This is a process called angiogenesis, which is important as new cells need new blood vessels. 2) Neurotransmitters are the body’s chemical messengers. Without these molecules, no messages would be carried from one cell to another. The primary ones are: Serotonin – this is the mood molecule, which also enhances your cognition, reward, learning, and memory. Dopamine – this is the motivation molecule, which encourages us to repeat nourishing experiences. Norepinephrine – this is the stress response molecule, which works with adrenaline to increase heart rate and keep blood pumping from the heart. When we exercise, these are all released immediately, regulating our mood, fine-tuning our attention, and enhancing our learning. 3) Functional and structural brain changes occur when we exercise, affecting the morphology (form and structure) and connectivity of our brain. This primarily occurs in two key parts of the brain: Prefrontal cortex – located in the frontal lobe, this area of the brain is used to make decisions and complex plans as well as express our personality. Hippocampus – located in the temporal lobe, this area of the brain is where we store new memories. Exercise increases the grey matter volume in both these areas of the brain – the size of them increases and their connection to other parts is strengthened. They each help us handle stress and our emotions, so the better they work then the more effectively we can handle such strong feelings. Exercise also helps delivers more oxygen and nutrients to these areas and improves waste removal. 4) Socio-emotional changes take place when we exercise, affecting our sleep stress and mood, etc. plus our cognitive functions, including memory, attention, and decision making. Besides directly affecting the brain, exercise also reduces peripheral risk factors for cognitive decline, such as hypertension and insulin resistance – components of metabolic syndrome that converge to increase the risk for brain dysfunction and neurodegeneration. So, from all these different processes you can how exercise affects the brain in a variety of ways. Are there any types of exercise that specifically enhance brain functionality? Can we exercise our brains? Freestyle forms of exercise, such as hip hop dancing or skateboarding, could be especially beneficial for the brain because of how engaged it needs to be and how it challenges your brain to be creative. Definitely. Exercise is essentially medicine for the mind so working out your body will boost it as well. The best type of exercise for your brain is the one that you like because enjoyment is the most important factor. Even a 30-minute walk every day is good for your brain. Regular aerobic exercise (that raises your heart rate) is good for your brain because an increased intensity level causes more growth factors and neurochemicals to arise. This will have a positive impact on your stress levels, learning, and memory. HIIT is a great option for exercising your brain because there is evidence that it causes different types of benefits compared to low-intensity aerobic exercise, such as increased endothelial function (Petrick et al. 2020). Resistance training could also be very beneficial, if executed correctly, as studies (Herold et al. 2019) have shown that it leaves you with meaningful functional brain changes, especially in the frontal lobe, which are accompanied by improvements in executive functions. Freestyle forms of exercise, such as hip hop dancing or skateboarding, could be especially beneficial for the brain because of how engaged it needs to be and how it challenges your brain to be creative. Any form of movement is good. Movement with high-intensity is better – be it cycling, boxing, or even salsa dancing. A combination of exercises, which includes some form of high-intensity movement two or three times a week, will give you the best overall result. Variety is key – exercise that makes you break a sweat is best but it doesn’t have to be every day. Are there any differences between short-term effects and long-term effects of exercise on the brain? Even two minutes of exercise can immediately improve your attention and learning results. Most of the benefits detailed above are the result of long-term, regular exercise – requiring weeks or months of practice. However, a short bout of exercise will have its effects as well. Information processes, attention, working memory, problem-solving, decision making – these all improve for a period of up to two hours post-exercise. Creativity also might increase immediately after exercise (Frith et al. 2019), which anecdotal evidence (from great minds such as Nietzsche and Einstein) also supports. Going for a walk is a great way to think. Even two minutes of exercise can immediately improve your attention and learning results (Blomstrand & Engvall 2020). Does exercise make you smarter? Enhance your memory or concentration? Exercise probably doesn’t make you more intelligent as this is genetic but it does help you preserve cognitive function over time. Exercise probably doesn’t make you more intelligent as this is genetic but it does help you preserve cognitive function over time. Cognitive decline accelerates rapidly as we age and the best way to protect our brain health is to be physically active. As mentioned above, our brain is plastic throughout our lifetime, therefore exercise does good for the brain, no matter how old you are. Exercising just before a learning task has been shown to help you recall this information later. So how about utilizing an exercise break just before learning something new and difficult? Exercise is like a\xa0 ‘concentration injection’. Imagine if you could get the same benefits from a can of soda? This is something that we can all utilize in our lives. Are there any ‘negative’ effects of exercise on the brain and its chemistry? Best to do some low-intensity training just before, as well right after, a learning task. Too much is too much. You don’t want to put your body under chronic stress by overdoing it. There is an upper limit where too much exercise stops being helpful. For example, if you were to do an ultramarathon, your cortisol levels might stay elevated, which may in turn temporarily freeze your memory functions. For some strenuous exercises, there will be different effects on the brain at different times following your workout. For example, immediately after doing HIIT, you will probably feel quite exhausted, which means it might not be so good for thinking. Best to do some low-intensity training just before, as well right after, a learning task. However, one study (van Dongen et al. 2016) demonstrated that if you exercise intensely, not right after, but four hours after a learning session your learning results are actually enhanced,\xa0 However, more studies need to be done for these time buffers with exercise and the brain.

Abstract The human brain adapts to changing demands by altering its functional and structural properties (“neuroplasticity”) which results in learning and acquiring skills. Convergent evidence from both human and animal studies suggests that physical activity facilitates neuroplasticity of certain brain structures and as a result cognitive functions. Animal studies have identified an enhancement of neurogenesis, synaptogenesis, angiogenesis and the release of neurotrophins as neural mechanisms mediating beneficial cognitive effects of physical exercise. This review summarizes behavioral consequences and neural correlates at the system level following physical exercise interventions in humans of different ages. The results suggest that physical exercise may trigger processes facilitating neuroplasticity and, thereby, enhances an individual's capacity to respond to new demands with behavioral adaptations. Indeed, some recent studies have suggested that combining physical and cognitive training might result in a mutual enhancement of both interventions. Moreover, new data suggest that to maintain the neuro-cognitive benefits induced by physical exercise, an increase in the cardiovascular fitness level must be maintained. Introduction Until the 1960s it was common textbook knowledge in neuropsychology that the adult nervous system is rather hard-wired and had probably a rather limited capacity to change (Grossman, 1967). Although the idea that the central nervous system is able to change its organization dates back to the times of William James (James, 1890) and Santiago Ramón y Cajal (Ramon y Cajal, 1895), empirical research supporting these theories did not start before the 1940s (Hebb, 1949). Today we know from both animal and human studies that the adult mammalian brain is continuously shaped by environmental input (for a review see Pascual-Leone et al., 2005). The capacity of the nervous system to modify its organization to altered demands and environments has been termed “neuroplasticity” (Bavelier and Neville, 2002). Neuroplasticity occurs when, for example, acquiring new skills, after damage to the nervous system and as a result of sensory deprivation (Bavelier and Neville, 2002). Neuroplasticity has been studied at different organizational levels of the nervous system, ranging from ion channels, to synapses, neurons, neuronal columns, cortical maps and behavior. These levels are, however, highly interlinked and interdependent. Associative learning, for example, induces changes in the release of neurotransmitters, which then may trigger a cascade of neurochemical events resulting in structural changes in the cerebral cortex such as the formation of new synapses or the reorganization of synaptic connections (Rosenzweig et al., 2002). For instance, these structural changes could sometimes lead to an expansion of cortical maps (Weinberger, 2004). Reorganizations of sensory cortical maps have been linked to changes in perceptual abilities measured at the behavioral level (Recanzone et al., 1991). Behavioral correlates of neuroplasticity might be adaptive. For example, interpreters who underwent an intense training procedure to learn a new language have been shown to develop larger gray matter volume in the hippocampus and to increase cortical thickness of the left middle frontal gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus and superior temporal gyrus (Martensson et al., 2012). The increase of gray matter in the hippocampus and in the superior temporal gyrus correlated positively with the interpreters’ language proficiency after the training. This suggests that the observed structural changes in these brain regions contributed to the acquisition of the new language. The hippocampus is known for its prominent role in spatial navigation and spatial memory (Bird and Burgess, 2008). This can be observed in the changes of the human hippocampus after a four-month spatial navigation training in a virtual environment: young and old men showed less hippocampal volume loss and had improved their spatial navigation skills after their training period, compared to the control group who did the same amount of walking, but did not receive a spatial navigation training (Lövden et al., 2012). Moreover, a reorganization of somatosensory and auditory cortices has been related to enhanced sensori-motor and auditory skills in professional musicians (Elbert et al., 1995, Münte et al., 2002), respectively, and to compensatory behavior in congenitally blind humans (Pascual-Leone and Torres, 1993, Pavani and Röder, 2012). Neuroplasticity mediates the behavioral recovery after brain injury and protocols known to increase cortical map plasticity have been successfully implemented into neuro-rehabilitation programs (Dancause and Nudo, 2011, Taub et al., 2002). However, neuroplasticity may result in maladaptive behavioral consequences as well (Elbert and Heim, 2001). For instance, reorganization in frontal and hippocampal regions has been associated with the development and maintenance of addictive behavior (Eisch et al., 2008, Van den Oever et al., 2010). Moreover, agonizing phantom sensations, like phantom limb pain and tinnitus, have been attributed to cortical reorganizations of somatosensory (Flor et al., 1995) and auditory cortices (Mühlnickel et al., 1998), respectively. Focal dystonia (“musician's” or “writer's clamp”) has been shown to go together with a reorganization in somatosensory (Elbert et al., 1998) and motor areas (Pujol et al., 2000). Thus, the same mechanisms that allow for adaptive changes of the nervous system and behavioral improvements sometimes result in maladaptive consequences (Nava and Röder, 2011). Maladaptive changes have been acknowledged as a “double-edged sword” of neuroplasticity and seem to be more likely in the context of atypical environments (Stevens and Neville, 2009). Since neuroplasticity enables the adaptation to changing demands and environments, the question arises how one can enhance the mechanisms of neuroplasticity to improve learning and memory, to prevent cognitive decline across the lifespan and to enhance recovery after brain injury. In the past years, evidence from both human and animal studies has suggested that physical activity and physical exercise have a facilitating effect on neuroplasticity and often go together with improved cognitive functioning. By enhancing neuroplasticity, physical exercise may facilitate maladaptive types of learning as well, such as the acquisition of fear or undesirable habits. However, as far as we know, this has not been reported in humans yet. As outlined in more detail below (Section 3), physical exercise seems to influence processes in the nervous systems supporting changes due to experience. Thus, additional stimulation or activity after exercising leads to neuroplasticity with a higher likelihood (Kempermann et al., 2010). Physical activity is defined as “any bodily movement produced by skeletal muscles that requires energy expenditure” while physical exercise is “a subcategory of physical activity that is planned, structured, repetitive, and purposeful in the sense that the improvement or maintenance of one or more components of physical fitness is the objective” (WHO, 2010, p.52-53). The aim of this review is to give an overview of results providing evidence for beneficial consequences of both physical activity and physical exercise for cognitive processes in humans. Moreover, the neural mechanisms of plasticity mediating the influence of physical activity on cognitive variables are explored. This is done by firstly referring to results from invasive studies in animals and secondly by summarizing results from brain imaging studies in humans. In addition to physical activity, other lifestyle factors and interventions have been considered to improve neuro-cognitive functions, including special types of nutrition (e.g. (Witte et al., 2009), pharmacological treatments (Farah et al., 2004, Sawaki et al., 2002, Walker-Batson et al., 2001), brain stimulation (Floel et al., 2008), enriched environments and cognitive stimulation (Kramer and Willis, 2002, Nyberg, 2005, van Praag et al., 2000). In this review we will focus on physical exercise interventions, including combined cognitive and physical interventions. The review will conclude with a discussion of the resulting consequences for future research and application. Section snippets Cross-sectional and cohort studies During the last decades, numerous studies reporting better cognitive or academic performance in physically active people compared to sedentary individuals have been published (for reviews see Churchill et al., 2002, Etnier et al., 1997, Sibley and Etnier, 2003). However, in the cross-sectional studies, it was not possible to make any kind of inference concerning causal relationships between physical activity and cognition. For instance, the direction of the observed effects could be reversed Animal studies Voluntary wheel running in rodents is a well-established animal model to study behavioral benefits and neural changes induced by exercising. One of the most often reported structural change after exercising in rodents is an increase in the rate of neurogenesis within the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus (Brown et al., 2003, van Praag et al., 1999a, van Praag et al., 1999b). The hippocampus is known to be important for spatial learning and memory. Accordingly, animals that showed an increase in Combining physical exercise with cognitive challenges Animal research has suggested that the hippocampus and spatial learning abilities are not only susceptible to physical exercise, but can also be affected by cognitive stimulation. In rodents, both wheel running and practicing hippocampus-dependent learning tasks have been shown to enhance neurogenesis (Gould et al., 1999, van Praag et al., 1999a), to increase the release of neurotrophins (Kesslak et al., 1998, Vaynman et al., 2004) and to improve spatial memory (Uysal et al., 2005, van Praag et Long-term effects of exercise As outlined in this review so far, data from intervention studies have provided convincing evidence that a few months of regular physical exercise have positive effects on cognitive functioning. However, little is known about the sustainability of exercise induced effects on cognitive functions; that is whether or how long gains prevail and under which conditions they prevail.

Most chronic disease deaths occur in middle-to low-income countries but are also a significant health problem in developed nations. Multiple chronic diseases now affect children and adolescents as well as adults. Being physically inactive is associated with increased chronic disease risk. Global societies are being negatively impacted by the increasing prevalence of chronic disease which is directly related to rising healthcare expenditures, workforce complications regarding attendance and productivity, military personnel recruitment, and academic success. However, increased physical activity (PA) and exercise are associated with reduced chronic disease risk. Most physiologic systems in the body benefit positively from PA and exercise by primary disease prevention and secondary disease prevention/treatment. The purpose of this brief review is to describe the significant global problem of chronic diseases for adults and children, and how PA and exercise can provide a non-invasive means for added prevention and treatment. Exercise-enhanced neuroplasticity targeting motor and cognitive circuitry in Parkinson's disease 2013, The Lancet Neurology Show abstract Exercise interventions in individuals with Parkinson's disease incorporate goal-based motor skill training to engage cognitive circuitry important in motor learning. With this exercise approach, physical therapy helps with learning through instruction and feedback (reinforcement) and encouragement to perform beyond self-perceived capability. Individuals with Parkinson's disease become more cognitively engaged with the practice and learning of movements and skills that were previously automatic and unconscious. Aerobic exercise, regarded as important for improvement of blood flow and facilitation of neuroplasticity in elderly people, might also have a role in improvement of behavioural function in individuals with Parkinson's disease. Exercises that incorporate goal-based training and aerobic activity have the potential to improve both cognitive and automatic components of motor control in individuals with mild to moderate disease through experience-dependent neuroplasticity. Basic research in animal models of Parkinson's disease is beginning to show exercise-induced neuroplastic effects at the level of synaptic connections and circuits.

Abstract Physical exercise may improve cognitive function by modulating molecular and cellular mechanisms within the brain. We propose that the facilitation of long-term synaptic potentiation (LTP)-related pathways, by products induced by physical exercise (i.e., exerkines), is a crucial aspect of the exercise-effect on the brain. This review summarizes synaptic pathways that are activated by exerkines and may potentiate LTP. For a total of 16 exerkines, we indicated how blood and brain exerkine levels are altered depending on the type of physical exercise (i.e., cardiovascular or resistance exercise) and how they respond to a single bout (i.e., acute exercise) or multiple bouts of physical exercise (i.e., chronic exercise). This information may be used for designing individualized physical exercise programs. Finally, this review may serve to direct future research towards fundamental gaps in our current knowledge regarding the biophysical interactions between muscle activity and the brain at both cellular and system levels.

Introduction The beneficial effect of physical exercise on cognition first appeared in literature in the 1930s ( Burpee and Stroll, 1936 , Beise and Peaseley, 1937 ). A search in PubMed with the terms “exercise” AND “cognition” shows how this topic has exploded in the last decades, reaching over one hundred publications a year in 1998 and over 3000 publications a year in 2020. However, the underlying mechanisms of physical exercise-induced cognitive improvements are still not fully understood, indicating the complexity of the neurophysiological processes that mediate the beneficial effects of physical exercise on the brain ( Gomez-Pinilla and Hillman, 2013 , El-Sayes et al., 2019 , Kim et al., 2019 ). Of critical importance in this respect is neuroplasticity ( Martin et al., 2000 , Autio et al., 2020 ). Neuroplasticity refers to the brain’s ability to undergo functional and structural changes in response to external or internal stimuli from the environment or organs in the body ( Voss et al., 2017 ). Currently, there is a vast amount of research showing that neuroplasticity could well be induced by acute (i.e., a single bout) or chronic (i.e., a program of multiple bouts) exposure to physical exercise ( Knaepen et al., 2010 , Svensson et al., 2015 , Vilela et al., 2017 , Müller et al., 2020 ). At the level of the brain, acute exercise studies in humans have discovered transient changes in neurotransmitter levels like glutamate and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) immediately following physical exercise, as measured with proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( 1 H-MRS) ( Maddock et al., 2016 ). Both glutamate and GABA are important neurotransmitters in the mammalian brain and are known to be primary mediators of long-term synaptic potentiation (LTP) and long-term synaptic depression (LTD) through glutamatergic (see Box 1 ) and GABAergic pathways. LTP and LTD are neuroplastic processes, which respectively cause strengthening or weakening of excitatory synaptic connections within the brain ( Lisman, 2001 ). Both induce changes in the synapse involving a rapid, short-lasting alteration of the function of existing synaptic proteins by processes such as phosphorylation (i.e., early LTP or LTD) and a slower, longer-lasting change in the availability of synaptic proteins by targeting cell DNA and inducing transcription of new proteins (i.e., late LTP or LTD) ( Loprinzi, 2019 ). Box 1 The long-term synaptic potentiation process (LTP). LTP is mediated primarily through glutamatergic pathways. In glutamatergic synapses, a signal in the form of an action potential is transmitted from one neuron to the next by the release of glutamate from the presynaptic neuron and the subsequent activation of glutamatergic amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) receptors in the postsynaptic neuron. Postsynaptic AMPA receptor activation causes influx of Na + , depolarizing the postsynaptic membrane, which is measured as an excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) with patch clamp techniques. If many EPSPs from multiple excitatory synapses accumulate, depolarization reaches the threshold for the generation of a new action potential and the neural signal is transmitted. LTP is an activity-dependent process that makes the synapse become more responsive to subsequent stimuli, increasing the chance an action potential will be generated in the postsynaptic neuron. The activity-dependence lies in the fact that repeated excitatory stimulation causes the synaptic connections to become more and more strengthened ( Lisman, 2001 , Vaynman et al., 2003 , Marsden et al., 2010 ). LTP is likely dependent on the activation of Ca 2+ -sensing signaling pathways, which is (at least in part) mediated by activation of pre- and postsynaptic N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. These Ca 2+ permeable receptors require membrane depolarization and activation by glutamate to open ( Fig. 1 ). In the presynaptic neuron , depolarization of the presynaptic membrane by an action potential first activates voltage-gated Ca 2+ channels. This facilitates Ca 2+ -dependent exocytosis of glutamate-containing synaptic vesicles. Consequently, Ca 2+ influx further increases by the opening of NMDA receptors, which results in the activation of pathways involved in LTP, see section 2. These pathways are mainly thought to involve the increased release of glutamate upon activation by a subsequent action potential. This may result from an increased number of glutamate-containing vesicles available in the reserve pool, an increased number of vesicles being transported from the reserve pool towards the releasable pool, and an increased number of vesicles being released upon Ca 2+ influx ( Loprinzi, 2019 ). At the postsynaptic excitatory neuron , glutamatergic AMPA receptor activation causes influx of Na + , depolarizing the postsynaptic membrane. Consequently, NMDA receptors become activated, allowing Ca 2+ to flow into the cell. Postsynaptic Ca 2+ -sensing pathways result in the activation of kinases, which through phosphorylation induce an increased activity and number of glutamatergic AMPA receptors. This way, the EPSP level in response to a subsequent release of presynaptic glutamate will be enhanced ( Lisman, 2001 ). Of note, another form of neural plasticity that is mediated through glutamatergic pathways is long-term synaptic depression (LTD). Similar to LTP, LTD is also activated by Ca 2+ influx inside the cell. In contrast to LTP, phosphatases and not kinases have the overhand during LTD processes at the excitatory glutamatergic synapse. This results in a weakening of glutamatergic synaptic connections, by for example, internalization of AMPA receptors and a decrease in the number of glutamates containing vesicles ( Collingridge et al., 2010 ). LTD has a low intracellular Ca 2+ threshold, and is typically induced by a prolonged modest increase in Ca 2+ . In contrast, the induction of LTP requires a brief, but higher amplitude of intracellular Ca 2+ increase ( Yang et al., 1999 ). An in between zone is also expected to exist, where the amplitude and/or duration of the Ca 2+ influx is not sufficient for the induction of neither LTP nor LTD ( Lisman, 2001 ). Several pathways may cause that LTD and not LTP would be induced by a Ca 2+ increase, as is described in more detail by Collingridge et al. (2010) . One influential pathway on LTP/LTD we would like to mention is through inhibitory inputs from GABAergic synapses. GABA receptors are Cl - channels, which hyperpolarize the postsynaptic membrane upon opening, called inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSP). This may cause membrane depolarization by Na + not to reach the threshold for opening of NMDA receptors at the glutamatergic synapse upon AMPA activation and Ca 2+ levels to remain low ( Marsden et al., 2010 , Mele et al., 2016 ). Studies have shown that high GABAergic input causes LTD to be induced more readily. This way, a certain concentration of intracellular Ca 2+ may induce LTD, when in the absence of GABAergic input it would induce LTP or neither LTP nor LTP ( Steele and Mauk, 1999 ). A detailed discussion on the LTD process and the interplay between LTP and LTD is outside the scope of this review paper, but is described in more detail by others, e.g. ( Steele and Mauk, 1999 , Yang et al., 1999 , Lisman, 2001 , Collingridge et al., 2010 , Marsden et al., 2010 , Mele et al., 2016 ). ‘LTP-like’ processes (i.e., the increased efficacy of synaptic neurotransmission through neural networks) are found in many brain regions, playing a critical role in several domains of cognitive function ( Martin et al., 2000 ). For example, disruption of LTP-like processes in the hippocampal, prefrontal, visual, auditory, and motor cortex were respectively suggested to result in an impairment of episodic memory function ( Chen et al., 2000 , Barnes, 2003 ), working memory and executive function ( Dallérac et al., 2011 ), visual ( Yeap et al., 2008 ), auditory ( O’Donnell et al., 2004 ), and motor processing ( Frantseva et al., 2008 ). These disruptions can be found with aging ( Barnes, 2003 ), Alzheimer’s disease ( Chen et al., 2000 ), major depression ( Normann et al., 2007 ), and other psychiatric ( Frantseva et al., 2008 , Yeap et al., 2008 ) and neurological disorders ( Rison and Stanton, 1995 , Bliss and Cooke, 2011 , Dallérac et al., 2011 , Conte et al., 2012 ). While the direct measurement of LTP requires invasive in vivo or in vitro electrophysiological tests, LTP-like processes can also be assessed with non-invasive techniques. For example, LTP-like processes in the human motor cortex can be assessed with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) ( Frantseva et al., 2008 ). Furthermore, electroencephalography (EEG) ( Kirk et al., 2010 ) can show LTP-like processes in the visual cortex by measuring visually-evoked potentials (VEP) ( Yeap et al., 2008 ), or in the auditory cortex by using auditory evoked potentials (AEP) ( O’Donnell et al., 2004 ). Physical exercise can induce either short- or long-lasting neuroplastic changes in the brain. Early LTP is considered a candidate mechanism for the brain’s short-lasting functional changes that occur during and/or immediately following acute exercise ( Crabbe and Dishman, 2004 , Yanagisawa et al., 2010 , Singh et al., 2014b , van Dongen et al., 2016 ). These functional brain changes can be detected with TMS ( Singh et al., 2014b ), EEG ( Crabbe and Dishman, 2004 ), functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) ( Yanagisawa et al., 2010 ), or functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) ( van Dongen et al., 2016 ). In addition, late LTP processes are likely activated during and/or shortly after the exposure to acute exercise, but measurable structural changes have only been observed following chronic exercise ( Colcombe et al., 2006 , Erickson et al., 2011 , Gonzales et al., 2013 , Haeger et al., 2019 , Herold et al., 2019 ). Importantly, the pathways activated in the process of late LTP also increase the transcription of growth and survival stimulating factors, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). The transcription of BDNF was shown both after acute exercise and chronic exercise ( Venezia et al., 2017 ). The resulting increased availability of BDNF may, in turn, upregulate pathways of neurogenesis , increasing the number of neurons in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus ( Cho et al., 2013 ). These newly formed neurons were described to activate LTP processes more easily ( Snyder et al., 2001 , Van Praag et al., 2002 ). Without effortful learning, and thus the activation of LTP, these new neurons do not survive more than three weeks ( Shors et al., 2012 ). This might indicate that newly formed neurons are dependent on the survival-promoting factors which are being released during LTP for further maturation and to be hooked up into functional networks ( Shors et al., 2012 , Denoth-Lippuner and Jessberger, 2021 ). A successful process of neurogenesis might explain the biochemical and structural brain changes reported in chronic exercise studies such as increases in N-acetyl aspartate, a neurometabolic marker of neuronal integrity ( Gonzales et al., 2013 ) measured with 1 H-MRS, and increases in gray matter volume and white matter microstructural organization ( Colcombe et al., 2006 ) measured with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These are interesting findings, as higher levels of N-acetyl aspartate and larger brain volume has been associated with better cognitive functioning in older adults ( Fjell and Walhovd, 2010 , Cleeland et al., 2019 ). In sum, a vast amount of research suggests that both acute and chronic exercise have beneficial effects on the biological mechanisms that mediate neuroplasticity, possibly through a physical exercise-induced enhanced response to LTP induction, which in turn induces functional and structural changes to the brain, improving cognitive function ( Erickson et al., 2011 , Broadhouse et al., 2020 ). Yet, how muscle activity eventually results in the facilitation of LTP is still a topic of debate. An increasingly popular explanation for the mechanism of cognitive enhancement following physical exercise is the exerkine hypothesis. Exerkines are all of the peptides, metabolites, and nucleic acids released into the bloodstream during and following physical exercise. Depending on the organ they are being released from, they are called myokines , adipokines , or hepatokines, respectively referring to physical exercise-induced factors released from muscle, adipose tissue , or the liver ( Pedersen, 2019 ). Some of these exerkines may cross the blood–brain barrier ( Kastin and Akerstrom, 1999 , Carro et al., 2000 , Dogrukol-Ak et al., 2003 , Higuchi et al., 2007 , Oury et al., 2013 , Agudelo et al., 2014 , Ribeiro et al., 2014 , Takimoto and Hamada, 2014 , Yau et al., 2014 , Li et al., 2015 , Moon et al., 2016 , Serra-Millàs, 2016 , Wrann, 2016 ). It is plausible to assume that exerkines which crossed the blood–brain barrier can facilitate signaling pathways that regulate the induction of LTP. In this narrative review, we elucidate the possible role that the physical exercise-induced enhancement of the LTP process by the release of exerkines may play in improving brain functions, while showing how it fits the currently popular view that exerkines are involved in multiple signaling pathways that mediate neuroplasticity. As a general objective, we aim to generate a framework that structures all relevant information about exerkines that are possibly involved in the regulation of early and late stages of LTP in the human brain. We decided to review existing literature on growth factors, myokines , cytokines, metabolites, hormones, and neuropeptides , including only those that are known to be released or generated during physical exercise and appear to have direct or indirect application for the enhancement of early and/or late LTP ( Fig. 1 , Fig. 2 ). We purposefully did not review all exerkines that may cross the blood–brain barrier, as for some of them, empirical evidence suggesting the cellular pathway for the facilitation of LTP is not available, unclear, or conflicting. For every exerkine addressed, we will describe their origin, discuss if the effect is to be expected after acute or chronic exercise and differentiate between cardiovascular or resistance exercise ( Table 1 ). In section two, the process of LTP will be explained in short, focused on the pathways important for discussion in the remainder of the paper. In section three, 16 exerkines of interest will be addressed one by one. We start with growth factors (i.e., brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), and growth hormone (GH)), followed by pro- and anti-inflammatory biomarkers (i.e., cytokines and kynurenine), of whom some are myokines. Then, we discuss other myokines (i.e., irisin , cathepsin-B, apelin , and adiponectin) and metabolites (i.e., lactate and β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB)). At last, we describe the remaining exerkines that could not be placed in any of the other groups (i.e., osteocalcin , orexin-A, ghrelin , and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)). In sections four and five, we summarize the most interesting conclusions to be drawn from this comprehensive review paper and propose how this information can be used for future research.

Long-term synaptic potentiation For the sake of clarity, we briefly report the most important intracellular pre- and postsynaptic pathways involved in LTP ( Fig. 1 ). At the presynaptic neuron, activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-type ionotropic glutamate receptors induces Ca 2+ -triggered autophosphorylation of Ca 2+ -calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CamKII). In turn, CamKII activates synapsin I by phosphorylation and mediates the transcription of synapsin I via phosphorylation of the transcription factor cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-response element binding protein (CREB) ( Vaynman et al., 2003 , Murray and Holmes, 2011 ). Synapsin I controls the fraction of synaptic vesicles available for release. After activation of synapsin I, synaptic vesicles from the reserve pool are transferred to the releasable pool. Moreover, elevated synapsin I levels at the presynaptic terminal are thought to increase the rate of synaptic vesicle recycling and formation. This is important to prevent synaptic fatigue due to vesicular rundown on subsequent stimulation ( Vaynman et al., 2003 , Gerth et al., 2017 ). In addition, calcium-sensitive adenylyl cyclases activate cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA). PKA is also capable of phosphorylating synapsin I ( Chenouard et al., 2020 ). For a more elaborate overview of presynaptic mechanisms , we refer to the review of Yang and Calakos (2013) . At the postsynaptic neuron, NMDA-dependent Ca 2+ influx also activates CamKII. Here, CamKII phosphorylates amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) receptors, making them more easily activated. Also, CamKII enhances surface AMPA receptor levels by inducing exocytosis of internalized receptors in the membrane surface ( Lu et al., 2001 ) and de novo synthesis of AMPA receptors via activation of the transcription factor CREB ( Middei et al., 2013 ). Next, PKA stimulates CamKII activity by inhibiting protein phosphatase-1, it potentiates AMPA receptors by phosphorylation ( Roche et al., 1996 ), and also activates CREB ( Winder and Sweatt, 2001 ). In addition to NMDA-receptors, several exerkines, such as BDNF and IGF-1, have been found to activate pre- and postsynaptic intracellular pathways with similar effects ( Fig. 1 ). These exerkine-induced pathways can transiently potentiate the response of presynaptic synapsin I or postsynaptic AMPA receptor activity during the activation of a subsequent LTP process by phosphorylation (i.e., early LTP) or by inducing transcription of synapsin I and AMPA receptors by activating the transcription factor CREB (i.e., late LTP) ( Vaynman et al., 2003 , Prescott et al., 2006 , Kim et al., 2010 , Murray and Holmes, 2011 , Molina et al., 2012 , Ribeiro et al., 2014 , Wang et al., 2019 ). Furthermore, some exerkines were reported to indirectly increase the effect of the following LTP induction. For example, by potentiating NMDA receptors, or by inducing transcription or enhancing activity of proteins critical for LTP, like NMDA receptors, downstream products like CamKII and CREB, or BDNF, IGF-1 and their receptors ( Fig. 2 ) ( Carro et al., 2001 , Vaynman et al., 2003 , Ding et al., 2006 , Yang et al., 2009 , Kim et al., 2010 , Molina et al., 2012 , Yang et al., 2014 , Wang et al., 2019 ). Other exerkines may play a regulatory role by modulating synaptic transmission (e.g., kynurenine) ( Rózsa et al., 2008 , Potter et al., 2010 , Demeter et al., 2013 , Vécsei et al., 2013 ) or transcription of other exerkines (e.g., lactate and osteocalcin) ( Wrann et al., 2013 , Khrimian et al., 2017 , Nicolini et al., 2020 ). These findings underscore how physical exercise may facilitate pathways involved in the LTP process by increasing the circulating levels of these exerkines. We will discuss these exerkine-induced pathways in more detail below. 3. Exerkines with the potential to alter LTP-related pathways In this section, we will describe the role of 16 different exerkines on LTP. These include growth factors, myokines, cytokines, metabolites, hormones, and neuropeptides that are released during physical exercise and have the potential to alter LTP-related pathways. When evidence on the exerkine-mediated facilitation or impairment of LTP-related pathways was not available, unclear or conflicting, the exerkine was not included in this paper, even if the concerned exerkine was known to cross the blood–brain barrier. We will report how the included exerkines are upregulated by physical exercise and the organ of their origin. Furthermore, we will highlight the possible synaptic pathways that they may activate ( Fig. 2 ). Finally, we will discuss if the effect is to be expected after acute or chronic exercise and differentiate between cardiovascular or resistance exercise ( Table 1 ). Findings from both animal and human studies are included. A detailed description of study characteristics including mean age of the subjects, gender of the subjects, healthy/unhealthy study population, fitness level of the subjects, physical exercise duration, physical exercise intensity, and the direction of the (subgroup specific) significant/insignificant changes of the levels of a certain exerkine following acute/chronic cardiovascular/resistance exercise of all physical exercise studies described in this section is provided in Supplementary Table S1 (for blood exerkine levels) and S2 (for brain exerkine levels). Table 1 can be considered a short summary of Supplementary Table S1 and S2. 3.1. Growth factors 3.1.1. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) BDNF is recognized as a growth factor with a wide repertoire of neurotrophic and neuroprotective properties in the CNS and the periphery ( Knaepen et al., 2010 ). It can be produced by neurons ( Lessmann et al., 2003 ), astrocytes ( Numakawa et al., 2010 ), and endothelial cells ( Wang et al., 2006 ) within the brain. During physical exercise, an increase in circulating BDNF levels may result from the release of BDNF from skeletal muscle cells or platelets ( Antony and Li, 2020 , Le Blanc et al., 2020 , Farmer et al., 2021 ). Skeletal muscle cells may synthesize ( Matthews et al., 2009 ) and release BDNF into the circulation ( Máderová et al., 2019 ) in response to physical exercise. Platelets were found to contain 99% of circulating BDNF ( Radka et al., 1996 ). The number of circulating BDNF-containing platelets is increased during physical exercise when the activation of the sympathetic system causes splenic constriction ( Ahmadizad and El-Sayed, 2003 , Stewart et al., 2003 ). At last, increased shear stress due to acceleration of blood flow during physical exercise causes the release of platelet-derived BDNF ( Fujimura et al., 2002 ). The increased shear stress was also reported in the cerebral vasculature during physical exercise ( Jorgensen et al., 1992 ). However, Pardridge et al. (1994) found that peripherally administered BDNF was rapidly cleared from the systemic circulation and was not able to be delivered to the brain. As was reviewed by Serra-Millàs (2016) , the relationship between peripheral and central levels of BDNF remains a topic of discussion. While some studies suggest peripherally administered BDNF may cross the blood–brain barrier or have beneficial effects on central nervous system functioning, several other studies reported blood–brain barrier permeability for BDNF to be poor or absent ( Serra-Millàs, 2016 ). It is possible that the central increases in BDNF availability following physical exercise, as were found in animal studies (see below), merely result from the stimulation of central BDNF synthesis. Other exerkines may be important mediators of this effect. This will be substantiated by pathways of the other exerkines discussed in sections 3.1.2 till 3.5.4, some of whom were found to induce the hippocampal release of BDNF during physical exercise. 3.1.1.1. Pathway Evidence from studies including animal models suggests that the physical exercise-induced increase of BDNF levels in the brain enhances the response to LTP induction by electrophysiological stimulation ( Novkovic et al., 2015 , Miao et al., 2021 ). For example, in wild type and heterozygote BDNF +/- mice, 5\xa0weeks of voluntary physical exercise was found to elevate BDNF levels compared with sedentary controls and enhance LTP activity, measured with in vitro electrophysiological recordings . In the BDNF +/- mice, LTP was initially impaired, but physical exercise restored it to the level of sedentary wild type mice ( Novkovic et al., 2015 ). Another study reported a dose-dependent enhancement of synaptic responses to electrophysiological stimuli after BDNF administration on slices of the anterior cingulate cortex of male mice in vitro ( Miao et al., 2021 ). BDNF acts via tropomyosin-receptor kinase-B (TrkB) receptors in the postsynaptic density of the excitatory synapse ( Fig. 1 , Fig. 2 ). TrkB receptors mediate many signaling cascades involved both in early and late LTP ( Müller et al., 2020 ). Specifically, BDNF binding to the TrkB receptor causes dimerization and autophosphorylation of the receptor. Consequently, docking sites for Src homology 2 domain-containing adapter protein (Shc) and phospholipase C-γ (PLCγ) emerge. Shc is coupled with Ras and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling cascades. Ras activates extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK), a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) that may, in turn, activate several other pathways by phosphorylating its target ( Murray and Holmes, 2011 ). For example, on rat hippocampal slices, inhibition of ERK was found to prevent the phosphorylation of CamKII, which is crucial in the LTP process ( Giovannini et al., 2001 ). ERK also activates CREB ( Finkbeiner et al., 1997 ) and following a physical exercise-induced rise in BDNF, CREB was seen to induce its own gene expression, thereby increasing the number of CREB molecules ( Vaynman et al., 2003 ). Moreover, CREB was found to induce the upregulation of BDNF in response to Ca 2+ influx in the postsynaptic cell ( Shieh and Ghosh, 1999 ), CamKII during the process of LTP ( Giovannini et al., 2001 ), NMDA receptor transcription following administration of BDNF ( Caldeira et al., 2007 ) and TrkB receptors following physical exercise in response to increased BDNF levels ( Vaynman et al., 2003 ). Ras also promotes the activation of PI3K. In turn, PI3K activates Akt, which counteracts pro-apoptotic proteins, stimulating survival ( Murray and Holmes, 2011 ). Both Ras and PI3K signaling cascades were found to lead to the phosphorylation of NMDA receptors following administration of BDNF on cultured mouse hippocampi , increasing NMDA receptor open probability ( Xu et al., 2006 ). Furthermore, PI3K was involved in increasing surface AMPA receptor expression during LTP in cultured hippocampal neurons ( Man et al., 2003 ). Results from Vaynman et al. (2003) suggested that the interplay between the TrkB and NMDA receptor signaling cascades is crucial for the CREB-mediated transcription of BDNF, TrkB, CREB and synapsin I mRNA, as blocking of any of these two receptors fully abrogated the physical exercise-induced increases in these transcripts ( Vaynman et al., 2003 ). Next to the Shc induced pathways, PLCγ will promote another pathway starting with the catalyzation of lipids to inositol 1,4,5 triphospate (IP3). IP3 binds to receptors on the endoplasmic reticulum, triggering calcium release ( Yamamoto et al., 2000 ). This calcium release enhances LTP through activation of the CamKII and PKA mediated pathways similarly as upon activation of NMDA-receptors. Furthermore, IP3 activity is required to keep AMPA receptors clustered at the postsynaptic membrane , as shown on hippocampal slices ( Arendt et al., 2010 ). PLCγ also induces an increase in diacylglycerol (DAG), which regulates protein kinase C (PKC). In turn, PKC might be required for the ERK cascade ( Murray and Holmes, 2011 ) and was found to potentiate AMPA receptors by phosphorylation in cultured neurons during LTP ( Roche et al., 1996 ). BDNF also binds TrkB receptors at the presynaptic neuron of the excitatory synapse ( Fig. 1 , Fig. 2 ). Here, in vitro examination found that ERK signaling activates synapsin I by phosphorylation, targeting synaptic vesicles from the reserve pool toward the releasable pool ( Jovanovic et al., 1996 ). Moreover, BDNF-mediated activation of the PLC/IP3 pathway will increase presynaptic intracellular Ca 2+ -levels. This increases CamKII signaling and results in CREB-mediated transcription of synapsin I. Synapsin I levels were found to increase following cardiovascular exercise, which was abrogated after blocking CamKII ( Vaynman et al., 2003 , Murray and Holmes, 2011 ). 3.1.1.2. Acute exercise effect Both acute cardiovascular and resistance exercise were found to transiently increase circulating BDNF in a meta -analysis that included 47 studies on cardiovascular exercise and eight studies on resistance exercise ( Dinoff et al., 2017 ). Dinoff et al. (2017) reported that physical exercise with a duration of more than 30\xa0min induced higher elevations of circulating BDNF than shorter physical exercise bouts. They also found that plasma BDNF measurements increased more in response to physical exercise compared to serum measurements and that studies including more males had greater effect sizes than those where the majority of participants were females. With approximately three-quarters of all participants in the included acute exercise studies being males, subgroup analysis revealed that only in males significant increases in circulating BDNF were found ( Dinoff et al., 2017 ). This might be due to that women already have higher basal serum BDNF levels than men ( Glud et al., 2019 ). It was reported that estrogen levels influence circulating BDNF levels and BDNF signaling pathways ( Harte-Hargrove et al., 2013 , Dong et al., 2017 ). Furthermore, Dinoff et al. (2017) found no significant difference in effect sizes associated with age, with most acute exercise studies including young adults. At last, higher cardiorespiratory fitness was associated with greater increases in circulating BDNF ( Dinoff et al., 2017 ). In the brain, studies in male rats showed that acute voluntary wheel running induced elevated levels of hippocampal BDNF ( Oliff et al., 1998 , Takimoto and Hamada, 2014 ). 3.1.1.3. Chronic exercise effect While Knaepen et al. (2010) concluded in their review that chronic exercise is rather unlikely to elevate basal BDNF concentration in healthy adults, more recent meta -analyses did find small effects in favor of a peripheral BDNF rise of baseline levels in response to regular cardiovascular exercise ( Szuhany et al., 2015 , Dinoff et al., 2016 ). Moreover, in a systematic review including older adults with cognitive decline, serum levels of BDNF significantly rose after chronic cardiovascular training ( de Assis and de Almondes, 2017 ). However, this was not confirmed in a more recent meta -analysis including older adults with or without cognitive decline ( Marinus et al., 2019 ). The latter meta -analysis, including eight resistance training and four combined cardiovascular and resistance training studies, stated that in order to increase baseline BDNF levels, resistance training is an essential component of the physical exercise program in older adults ( Marinus et al., 2019 ). In contrast, the meta -analysis of Dinoff et al. (2016) , including healthy adults of all ages, did not find an effect of chronic resistance training on resting circulating BDNF levels. Therefore, this effect is probably age-specific ( Table 1 ), although future studies are needed to confirm the inference we make here. Moreover, Dinoff et al. (2016) did not report effect differences dependent on physical exercise intervention characteristics such as duration, frequency, or intensity. In addition, there was no difference between BDNF rises measured in serum or plasma. Finally, age, gender, and body mass index were not related to the effect found after chronic exercise ( Dinoff et al., 2016 ). Brain levels of BDNF, TrkB and CREB in male rat hippocampus did also increase after chronic cardiovascular ( Vaynman et al., 2003 , Berchtold et al., 2005 , Cassilhas et al., 2012 ) and resistance training ( Tang et al., 2017 , Vilela et al., 2017 ). It was shown that 3\xa0weeks of running resulted in elevated hippocampal BDNF levels until 2\xa0weeks after cessation of physical exercise ( Berchtold et al., 2010 ). In the study of Tang et al. (2017) , the resistance trained male diabetic rats showed a higher upregulation of TrkB and CREB genes than cardiovascular trained diabetic rats. 3.1.2. Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) IGF-1 plays a role in enhancing insulin action ( Moses et al., 1996 ), and decreased levels of IGF-1 are associated with age-related sarcopenia ( Mak and Rotwein, 2006 , Bian et al., 2020 ). It is secreted both centrally and peripherally and may cross the blood–brain barrier ( Carro et al., 2000 ). The central release has been shown in regions of the brain involved in postnatal neurogenesis , e.g. hippocampus, cerebellum , and olfactory bulb ( Wrigley et al., 2017 ). IGF-1 release in the brain was inconsistently indicated as being regulated by growth hormone (GH) ( Furigo et al., 2018 ) or being GH-independent ( Lupu et al., 2001 ). Peripherally, GH is considered to mediate the main release of IGF1- from the liver ( Schwander et al., 1983 ). During physical exercise, circulating IGF-1 levels were found to increase rapidly in some studies, which indicates it is most likely released from IGF-1 stores and not mediated by GH-induced transcription ( Berg and Bang, 2004 ). It was suggested that muscle cells contain such IGF-1 stores that are released upon muscle contraction ( Pedersen, 2019 ). Furthermore, IGF-1 mRNA expression was found to be upregulated in contracting muscles independently of GH ( Berg and Bang, 2004 ). However, the increase in circulating IGF-1 levels is only inconsistently reported. A possible explanation was given by Carro et al. (2000) who indicated that after acute cardiovascular exercise brain IGF-1 levels increased, while circulating levels did not. They suggested that physical exercise might increase the uptake of IGF-1 in the brain (and other target organs) in association with its release from muscle and liver into the blood stream, keeping circulating IGF-1 levels relatively stable. Depending on the strength of this increased uptake, researchers might find increased, unchanged, or decreased circulating IGF-1 levels after physical exercise ( Carro et al., 2000 ). 3.1.2.1. Pathway In vitro examinations by Zheng and Quirion, 2004 , Ding et al., 2006 using hippocampal cultured neurons showed that the IGF-1 receptor shares downstream signaling cascades with the TrkB receptor in pre- and postsynaptic excitatory neurons ( Fig. 1 , Fig. 2 ). Hence, similarly to BDNF, IGF-1 is thought to activate PI3K/Akt, IP3/CamKII, and Ras/ERK pathways. Zheng and Quirion (2004) indicated IGF-1 causes rapid and sustained activation of Akt signaling , while it mediated only transient ERK signaling. The inverse was observed for BDNF, i.e. a transient activation of Akt signaling and a sustained activation of ERK signaling. Furthermore, systemic injection of IGF-1 or physical exercise-induced elevations of IGF-1 was found to increase transcription of hippocampal BDNF ( Carro et al., 2001 , Ding et al., 2006 ) and IGF-1 ( Ding et al., 2006 ) and intracerebroventricular administration of IGF-1 reversed the age-related decline in the number of NMDA receptors ( Sonntag et al., 2000 ). Blocking the IGF-1 receptor partly disrupted the physical exercise-induced increase of hippocampal BDNF levels and decreased memory recall performance ( Ding et al., 2006 ). To our knowledge, no studies have directly assessed the effect of physical exercise-induced IGF-1 on the increased response to induction of LTP. 3.1.2.2. Acute exercise effect Several reviews and meta -analyses confirmed that acute resistance exercise may increase circulating IGF-1 ( Berg and Bang, 2004 , de Alcantara Borba et al., 2020 , Gulick et al., 2020 ), while the findings concerning acute cardiovascular exercise are equivocal ( de Alcantara Borba et al., 2020 , Gulick et al., 2020 ). In the brain, there was evidence to suggest that acute cardiovascular exercise increases IGF-1 levels ( Carro et al., 2000 ). This was not confirmed in a more recent study ( Takimoto and Hamada, 2014 ). To the best of our knowledge, there are only two studies that examined the effect of acute resistance exercise on brain IGF-1 levels and signaling. One studied male rats ( Fernandes et al., 2016 ) while the other used female rats ( Kelty et al., 2019 ). Both failed to find an effect. Fernandes et al. (2016) indicated that this may have been caused by the time of sample collection, which was 24\xa0h after exercise, while circulating IGF-1 levels after acute exercise typically return back to baseline after 15 to 30\xa0min post-exercise ( Rubin et al., 2005 , West et al., 2009 , Rojas Vega et al., 2010 , Tsai et al., 2015 ). Also in the study of Kelty et al. (2019) , rats were killed and brain tissue was collected only 24\xa0h after the resistance exercise session. 3.1.2.3. Chronic exercise effect In a systematic review by Stein and colleagues (2018), circulating levels of IGF-1 were not found to be elevated after chronic cardiovascular exercise in older adults. Only one out of five studies found increased IGF-1 levels after cardiovascular exercise, while one even reported a decrease. This review included only two resistance training studies ( Stein et al., 2018 ). Both of them showed increased IGF-1 levels ( Cassilhas et al., 2007 , Tsai et al., 2015 , Stein et al., 2018 ). More recent meta -analyses confirmed that IGF-1 may increase following resistance training, but only in women more than 40\xa0years old, while at younger age IGF-1 levels might even decrease following resistance training ( Jiang et al., 2020 , Ye et al., 2020 , Amiri et al., 2021 ). Finally, evidence from animal models suggests that physical exercise training had no differential effect on the levels of IGF-1 in the brain as a function of gender. Specifically, it was found that hippocampal IGF-1 levels increased both in male and female rats following chronic cardiovascular training ( Ding et al., 2006 , Gomes et al., 2009 , Wong-Goodrich et al., 2010 , Cassilhas et al., 2012 ) and resistance ( Cassilhas et al., 2012 , Kelty et al., 2019 ) exercise. 3.1.3. Growth hormone (GH) GH is produced by the pituitary gland in response to GH-releasing hormone or somatostatin release from the hypothalamus. Most of the GH release occurs during sleep ( Sonntag et al., 2005 ), but it is also released from the pituitary gland during physical exercise ( Galbo, 1993 ). GH is thought to play a role in the post-exercise repair of tissues and synthesis of new tissues by stimulating protein anabolism . Furthermore, it helps to prepare the individual for future physical exercise bouts by enhancing the synthesis of gluconeogenic and lipolytic enzymes ( Galbo, 1993 ). Decreased GH levels are related to age-related sarcopenia in human subjects ( Bian et al., 2020 ). While studies before the year 2000 hypothesized that all of the cognitive effects of GH were mediated through its induction of IGF-1-synthesis, since then, some studies have indicated direct effects of GH on cognition ( Sonntag et al., 2005 ). 3.1.3.1. Pathway In the hippocampus, GH was found to induce dimerization of its receptor upon binding, which in turn activates Janus kinase 2 (JAK2). Activated JAK2 induces signaling cascades including PI3K/Akt and Ras/ERK. Via ERK, GH can also induce CREB activation. These pathways are very similar to the IGF-1 pathways and are shared with some of the BDNF pathways. GH receptor activates these pathways via JAK-mediated phosphorylation of non-receptor tyrosine kinases. In contrast, IGF-1 and BDNF receptors are receptor tyrosine kinases that can phosphorylate signaling molecules by themselves ( Lobie et al., 2000 ). It was shown that a period of daily GH injections facilitated LTP, restored age-related and sleep deprivation-induced alterations in NMDA receptor-dependent synaptic transmission , and enhanced AMPA receptor activity, as shown on CA1 hippocampal slices ( Kim et al., 2010 , Molina et al., 2012 ). At last, GH can stimulate neural IGF-1 signaling by inducing its transcription ( Furigo et al., 2018 ). We found no studies that examined the direct link between physical exercise-related increases in GH and the physical exercise-induced facilitation of LTP. Hence, this relationship can only be inferred from models that investigated the effect of GH administration ( Kim et al., 2010 , Molina et al., 2012 ). 3.1.3.2. Acute exercise effect Both acute cardiovascular and resistance exercise were found to induce increases in GH levels in a systematic review ( Wideman et al., 2002 ). It was indicated that this effect occurred both in men and women with similar levels being attained during physical exercise, but the increase from baseline was higher in men, with women having higher baseline GH levels. Older adults of both sexes showed an attenuated GH response to acute exercise. Furthermore, higher intensity of cardiovascular or higher volume of resistance exercise was suggested to induce larger GH increases ( Wideman et al., 2002 ). Furthermore, resistance exercise induced higher acute responses than cardiovascular exercise ( Consitt et al., 2007 ). 3.1.3.3. Chronic exercise effect A systematic review reported that some studies found increased baseline GH levels after chronic cardiovascular exercise, but not following chronic resistance training ( Wideman et al., 2002 ). The authors indicated that resistance exercise only induces an acute elevation of GH. However, resistance training studies that examine baseline 24\xa0h GH measurements (as is advised) remain scarce ( Wideman et al., 2002 ). In the brain, Blackmore and colleagues provided suggestive findings for the induction of GH signaling and activation of neural precursor cells in the subventricular zone after chronic cardiovascular exercise. They showed that in the absence of GH signaling, by administration of GH antagonist or in GH receptor null female mice, cardiovascular exercise training no longer resulted in the activation of neural precursor cells ( Blackmore et al., 2009 , Blackmore et al., 2012 ). 3.2. Pro- and anti-inflammatory markers 3.2.1. Cytokines Cytokines play a key role in immune responses. Cytokines such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-2, IL-8, IL-12, IL-15, IL-18, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) are considered to be markers of pro-inflammatory action. On the contrary, the cytokines IL-4 and IL-10 have anti-inflammatory effects ( Dai et al., 2013 , Svensson et al., 2015 , Agudelo et al., 2018 ). IL-6 activates both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory processes. It is suggested to have a controlling function in inflammation ( Smith and Miles, 2000 ). Some of these cytokines (e.g. IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α) are known to be released by muscle fibers into the bloodstream and, as such, are expected to play a role in the regulation of physical exercise-induced pro-and anti-inflammatory processes. Peripheral and central inflammatory levels are linked via blood-borne and neural routes of communication. As a result, peripheral inflammation may activate microglial cells in the brain. These innate immune cells react to inflammatory signals by de novo synthesis of inflammatory cytokines , further increasing inflammation within the brain ( Barrientos et al., 2015 ). Chronic elevation of (neuro-)inflammatory markers has previously been linked to obesity, metabolic syndrome, aging, cognitive decline, and many neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer’s dementia ( Kruse et al., 1993 , Cotman et al., 2007 , Yudkin, 2007 , Sartori et al., 2012 , Woods et al., 2012 , Su et al., 2019 ). Adipose tissue , especially visceral fat, is considered one of the largest contributors to systemic inflammation ( Yudkin, 2007 , Woods et al., 2012 ). Furthermore, inflammatory markers are secreted by senescent cells. These are old, damaged cells that, as a protective mechanism, have become locked into cell-cycle arrest to prevent the spread of damage and potential malignant transformation . In association, they exhibit altered secretory activity ( Coppé et al., 2010 , Hernandez-Segura et al., 2017 ). The number of these cells gradually increases as we get older ( Dimri et al., 1995 ). The age-related development of a chronic inflammatory status is also found in the brain ( Sartori et al., 2012 ). Indeed, magnetic resonance spectroscopy studies have shown age-related increases in neuro-inflammatory markers in the brain (i.e., myoinositol and choline) ( Glanville et al., 1989 , Urenjak et al., 1993 ). Furthermore, stereological findings have indicated increased numbers of glial cells in the frontal and temporal cortex with age ( Terry et al., 1987 ). These glial cells change into their pro-inflammatory phenotype in older adults ( Perry et al., 2007 , Cohen and Torres, 2019 ). It was suggested that these changes underlie, at least in part, the process of age-related cognitive decline ( Bourgognon and Cavanagh, 2020 ). 3.2.1.1. Pathway The effect of IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α, which are the most studied cytokines, on LTP and learning were recently reviewed by Bourgognon and Cavanagh (2020) . They describe that the effect is dependent of the intensity and duration of the inflammatory activity. Low brain cytokine levels may exert beneficial effects, while high or long-lasting elevations are detrimental to the LTP process. The latter is typically reported in older adults and neurodegenerative diseases ( Bourgognon and Cavanagh, 2020 , Ross et al., 2003 ). At the cellular level, a non-exhaustive summation of the pathways these cytokines interfere in (probably both in a beneficial or detrimental way depending on their concentration) are: the BDNF and IGF-1 signaling pathways, MAPK pathways both involved in synaptic plasticities such as the postsynaptic ERK pathway and those involved in cell damage or cell death such as c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 pathway, and the presynaptic ERK-mediated phosphorylation of synapsin I that induces glutamate release ( Bourgognon and Cavanagh, 2020 ). As an example, excessively high-intense chronic cardiovascular exercise was found to suppress LTP during in vivo recordings in the hippocampal CA1 area in rats, in association with the increased expression of inflammatory factors IL-1β and TNF-α and induced activation of microglial cells . In addition, the physical exercise paradigm increased levels of phosphorylated JNK, ERK and p38 ( Sun et al., 2017 ). Other studies on mice reported that the detrimental effect of elevated IL-1β on LTP could be abrogated by the administration of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 ( Lynch et al., 2004 , Lenz et al., 2020 ). While this study did not examine the effect of physical exercise, other studies have reported the circulating level of IL-10 to increase following cardiovascular exercise, e.g., Gomes da Silva et al. (2013) . 3.2.1.2. Acute exercise effect Acute bouts of cardiovascular and resistance exercise were associated with increased circulating levels of both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines ( Flynn et al., 2007 , Koch, 2010 , Johnson et al., 2020 ). The balance between the pro- and anti-inflammatory response to physical exercise is dependent on several factors, including the individual’s health status , intensity or duration of physical exercise, and glucose availability ( Flynn et al., 2007 ). In addition, pro-inflammatory cytokines may increase less following acute exercise in physical exercise-trained individuals, as was reported after six weeks of cardiovascular training ( Fonseca et al., 2021 ). Overall, the regulation of peripheral inflammation by physical exercise is a complex process and will not be addressed in detail in this review paper. For further reading, we refer to other review articles ( Cotman et al., 2007 , Woods et al., 2012 , Su et al., 2019 , da Scheffer and Latini, 2020 ). At brain levels, both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines also increased in response to acute cardiovascular exercise ( Packer et al., 2010 , Lovatel et al., 2013 , Packer and Hoffman-Goetz, 2015 , Nogueira et al., 2020 ). However, the link between physical exercise-induced peripheral and central inflammation is not clear. For example, in a study where IL-6 levels in human plasma and cerebrospinal fluid were measured after acute cardiovascular exercise at 60% of VO2 max, there was an increase in plasma IL-6 without accompanying cerebrospinal fluid IL-6 increase ( Steensberg et al., 2006 ). A more recent study, using a panel with 92 cytokines and chemokines to measure inflammatory markers in cerebrospinal fluid and plasma reported a modest increase in inflammatory markers in cerebrospinal fluid after acute vigorous intensity exercise ( Isung et al., 2021 ). However, after correction for multiple comparisons, only three cerebrospinal fluid and 12 plasma proteins were significantly changed. In line with Steensberg et al. (2006) , changes in cerebrospinal fluid IL-6 levels were nonsignificant ( Isung et al., 2021 ). Steensberg et al. (2006) suggested that IL-6 may not reach the brain via the cerebrospinal fluid, but through alternative routes such as via the hypothalamus, which does not have a blood–brain barrier, via afferent nerves , or from local release by endothelial cells or the pituitary gland ( Steensberg et al., 2006 ). 3.2.1.3. Chronic exercise effect Chronic cardiovascular and resistance exercises were found to reduce blood and brain pro-inflammatory cytokines and elicit anti-inflammatory effects in an impressive array of human and animal research ( Flynn et al., 2007 , Gibbons et al., 2014 , Kim, 2014 , Chupel et al., 2017 , Liu et al., 2020 , Roh et al., 2020 ). In humans, findings from resistance exercise studies suggested that lower levels of pre-exercise circulating pro-inflammatory factors were associated with better gains in muscle strength ( Forti et al., 2014 , Hangelbroek et al., 2018 , Grosicki et al., 2020 ). In contrast to the anti-inflammatory effect of chronic exercise, the cytokine hypothesis of overtraining by Smith states that an inadequate recovery between physical exercise bouts would lead to chronic inflammation, associated with fatigue and depression indicative of overtraining ( Smith, 2000 ). Only a limited amount of human studies investigated the effect of overtraining on pro-inflammatory markers, probably due to ethical considerations ( Izquierdo et al., 2009 , Main et al., 2009 , Main et al., 2010 , Halson et al., 2003 ). Most studies measured inflammatory markers immediately after cardiovascular exercise, which needs to be considered an acute exercise effect in excessively trained human subjects. These studies report increased elevations of pro-inflammatory cytokines following a bout of resistance or cardiovascular exercise in overtrained persons ( Izquierdo et al., 2009 , Main et al., 2009 , Main et al., 2010 ). We also found one study that reported increased morning pro-inflammatory markers before physical exercise in male cyclists during an intense training program ( Halson et al., 2003 ). On the brain level, animal studies found that chronic exercise decreased microglial activation in the hypothalamus of obese mice ( Barrientos et al., 2011 , Yi et al., 2012 ) and in the hippocampus of aged mice ( Kohman et al., 2013 ). Chronic cardiovascular ( Liu et al., 2013 , Bobinski et al., 2015 ) and resistance ( Liu et al., 2020 ) exercise decreased central pro-inflammatory cytokines in male rats, and chronic cardiovascular ( Gomes da Silva et al., 2013 ) and resistance exercise ( Liu et al., 2020 ) increased the level of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in the hippocampus of healthy old male rats and frontal cortex of male Alzheimer dementia mice, respectively. In contrast, maximal intensity cardiovascular exercise on seven consecutive days increased the expression of inflammatory factors IL-1β and TNF-α in the hippocampus of rats and induced the activation of microglial cells ( Sun et al., 2017 ). In healthy human subjects, observations from a recent study by Isung et al. (2021) showed that chronic exercise has only a small effect on inflammation-related protein levels in the cerebrospinal fluid. 3.2.1.4. Kynurenine Kynurenine is converted from tryptophan by the enzyme indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase in the liver ( Capuron et al., 2011 ). Pro-inflammatory cytokines, like IL-1β, TNF-α and IFN-γ have been shown to upregulate indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase ( Allison et al., 2017 ). In correspondence with high systemic inflammatory cytokine levels, high circulating kynurenine levels were found to be associated with reduced memory performance ( Solvang et al., 2019 ). During physical exercise, the activity of kynurenine aminotransferase is enhanced. This enzyme converts kynurenine into kynurenic acid , which is unable to cross the blood–brain barrier ( Agudelo et al., 2014 ). 3.2.1.5. Pathway Within the brain, kynurenine can be metabolized into quinolinic acid by macrophages and microglia, or into kynurenic acid by astrocytes. Quinolinic acid leads to overactivation of NMDA receptors, which contributes to excitotoxic neural damage ( Vécsei et al., 2013 ). Furthermore, it was found to have neuroinflammatory action ( Stone and Darlington, 2013 ). In contrast, kynurenic acid was found to be an antagonist of NMDA and α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors ( Potter et al., 2010 ). The latter receptors exist on presynaptic glutamatergic synapses and increase glutamate release from presynaptic neurons upon activation ( Vécsei et al., 2013 ). Similar to inflammatory cytokines, electrophysiological recordings on rat hippocampal slices in the CA1 region showed that perfusion of low concentrations of kynurenic acid was beneficial, while high concentrations were detrimental for LTP ( Rózsa et al., 2008 ). Only perfusion of low concentrations was found to increase AMPA receptor activity ( Prescott et al., 2006 ). In addition, low concentrations of kynurenic acid preferentially antagonized extrasynaptic NMDA receptors, sparing synaptic NMDA and AMPA receptors, while high concentrations completely antagonized both extrasynaptic and synaptic glutamatergic receptors ( Rózsa et al., 2008 , Demeter et al., 2013 , Vécsei et al., 2013 ). Kynurenic acid was not found to influence the number of NMDA or AMPA receptors ( Potter et al., 2010 ). Of note, none of these studies examined if physical exercise-induced elevations or reductions of kynurenine, quinolinic acid , or kynurenic acid have an influence on LTP. 3.2.1.6. Acute exercise effect A recent review paper from Joisten and colleagues (2020) that includes their own work reported the effect of acute and chronic exercise on kynurenine. After acute cardiovascular and resistance exercise, circulating kynurenine levels increased, but this elevation was associated with increased kynurenine aminotransferase and kynurenic acid levels ( Joisten et al., 2020 ). In their own work, Joisten et al. (2020) discovered that the kynurenine aminotransferase pathway was elevated to a higher extent following cardiovascular exercise compared with resistance exercise. From the literature review was derived that kynurenic acid/kynurenine ratios increased immediately and 60\xa0min after cardiovascular and immediately after resistance exercise, and kynurenine levels decreased compared with pre-exercise 60\xa0min after resistance or cardiovascular exercise ( Joisten et al., 2020 ). Another study recently reported that acute sprint interval exercise resulted in increased levels of kynurenine 60\xa0min after physical exercise in old but not in young healthy human subjects. The elevation of kynurenine in older adults was followed by increased levels of kynurenic acid 24\xa0h later ( Trepci et al., 2020 ). 3.2.1.7. Chronic exercise effect Chronic cardiovascular exercise was also found to upregulate muscle kynurenine aminotransferase activity in mice ( Agudelo et al., 2014 , Ieraci et al., 2020 ) and humans ( Agudelo et al., 2014 , Allison et al., 2019 ). Agudelo et al. (2014) showed this resulted in increased conversion of kynurenine into kynurenic acid. One other study confirmed decreased kynurenine levels following cardiovascular exercise in mice that received kynurenine injections ( Su et al., 2020 ). In contrast, most studies in humans have only reported trends of decreased circulating kynurenine levels or no effect after chronic cardiovascular or resistance exercise, as recently reviewed by Joisten et al. (2020) and confirmed in more recent studies (e.g., Isung et al. 2021 ). However, we found two studies that reported a decrease in circulating kynurenine levels after chronic resistance exercise in breast or pancreatic cancer patients, who had elevated baseline levels compared to healthy subjects ( Zimmer et al., 2019 , Pal et al., 2021 ). These results are suggestive to assume kynurenine levels only decrease following chronic exercise in conditions where they were elevated at baseline. In subjects with normal baseline levels, the upregulation of kynurenine aminotransferase activity seems only to keep levels in balance when physical exercise bouts tend to increase kynurenine levels. 3.3. Myokines 3.3.1. Irisin Irisin was initially best known for turning white adipose tissue into brown adipose tissue ( Boström et al., 2012 ). Furthermore, it was suggested to be a marker for muscle mass ( Ruan et al., 2020 ). Irisin is cleaved from the membrane protein FNDC5. This membrane protein is upregulated after activation of the transcriptional regulators: peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator 1α (PGC1α) and estrogen-related receptor-α (ERRα) ( Olesen et al., 2010 , Wrann et al., 2013 ). Physical exercise enhances the PGC1α/ERRα-induced expression of FNDC5 not only in muscle, but also in the hippocampus ( Wrann et al., 2013 , Wrann, 2016 ). It is suggested that peripheral, physical exercise-induced irisin can pass through the blood–brain barrier ( Wrann, 2016 , Lourenco et al., 2019 ). Finally, observations from an animal model showed that administration of irisin in the hippocampus increased the response to LTP induction by electrophysiological stimuli ( Mohammadi et al., 2019 ). 3.3.1.1. Pathway Physical exercise was found to upregulate FNDC5/irisin expression and improve LTP in a mouse Alzheimer’s dementia model. Downregulating FNDC5/irisin with lentivirus-mediated short hairpin RNA knockdown centrally or with anti-FNDC5 antibodies peripherally caused LTP not to improve following chronic exercise ( Lourenco et al., 2019 ). Physical exercise-induced irisin was found to increase BDNF levels and is thought to affect neurotransmission and/or regulation of LTP in the brain by stimulating the cAMP/PKA/CREB pathway ( Wrann et al., 2013 , Lourenco et al., 2019 ). Greater physical exercise-induced increases of irisin were correlated with higher physical exercise-induced BDNF levels ( Nicolini et al., 2020 ). However, it remains unknown which neuronal receptor induces this pathway after being activated by irisin ( Chen and Gan, 2019 ). 3.3.1.2. Acute exercise effect A systematic review reported that both acute cardiovascular and acute resistance exercise may induce a transient increase in irisin levels, as the authors found in six out of eight included studies ( Rodrigues et al., 2016 ). The two studies that did not find a significant effect used cardiovascular exercise ( Pekkala et al., 2013 ) ( Aydin et al., 2013 ). Tsuchiya et al. (2015) indicated that resistance exercise induces a larger irisin response than cardiovascular exercise alone or resistance and cardiovascular exercise combined. Kraemer et al. (2014) compared young men with women during the early follicular phase and mid-luteal phase of the menstrual cycle , but did not find any differences. Higher intensity cardiovascular exercise was associated with higher levels of irisin ( Daskalopoulou et al., 2014 , Huh et al., 2014 ), but there was no significant difference for age or fitness level ( Huh et al., 2014 ). 3.3.1.3. Chronic exercise effect Wrann et al. (2013) showed that irisin levels could be increased by chronic cardiovascular exercise both in blood and brain. Multiple animal studies using cardiovascular training confirmed their finding ( Wrann, 2016 , Uysal et al., 2018 , Lourenco et al., 2019 , Gruhn et al., 2021 ). In human studies, we found only two studies that showed increases in irisin levels in men following cardiovascular exercise ( Boström et al., 2012 , Miyamoto-Mikami et al., 2015 ) while others indicated no significant effect ( Pekkala et al., 2013 , Norheim et al., 2014 , Kim et al., 2016 ) and one showed decreases following sprint training in young physically active men ( Tsuchiya et al., 2016 ). Miyamoto-Mikami et al. (2015) found only significant increases in irisin levels in middle-aged/older men and not in the young subgroup. Despite that Wrann (2016) stated that resistance training would probably not induce FNDC5 expression, since resistance exercise was found to activate a different isoform of PCC-1α than cardiovascular exercise (PCC-1α4 instead of PCC-1α1), a recent meta -analysis of randomized controlled trials included three resistance training studies which showed significant irisin level increases ( Cosio et al., 2021 ). Furthermore, there were two resistance training studies reporting significant decreases and two reporting nonsignificant effects. Overall, the meta -analysis concluded that the effect of chronic resistance exercise on circulating irisin was a nonsignificant positive trend. However, subgroup analysis showed significant increases for older adults when % body fat decreased during the intervention period and when the intervention was less or equal to 12\xa0weeks. There was a significant decrease when resistance training lasted longer than 4\xa0months or when less than 80% of the sessions were supervised by a professional ( Cosio et al., 2021 ). Both studies with significant decreases had a duration of approximately 6\xa0months, with low intense physical exercise sessions and without progression in intensity ( Hecksteden et al., 2013 , Scharhag-Rosenberger et al., 2014 ). Subgroup analysis showed no differences for gender ( Cosio et al., 2021 ). One pilot study reported an increase in circulating irisin in their resistance training group compared to their cardiovascular training group and control group following 8\xa0weeks in obese subjects ( Kim et al., 2016 ). 3.3.2. Cathepsin-B Cathepsin-B is a lysosomal cysteine protease . During physical exercise, it is released from skeletal muscle cells. Cathepsin-B was found to pass through the blood–brain barrier and induce an increase in brain levels of BDNF. This was associated with improved memory function ( Moon et al., 2016 ). However, cathepsin-B is also suggested to be a major driver for inflammatory brain diseases, neurodegenerative disorders, and brain aging associated with cognitive decline, as reviewed by Hook et al. (2020) . Other authors have even advised to search for specific inhibitors of cathepsin-B as a therapeutic approach against neurodegeneration ( Nakanishi, 2020 ). 3.3.2.1. Pathway Cathepsin-B administration was reported to induce an increase in BDNF mRNA and protein levels on hippocampal progenitor cells in culture ( Moon et al., 2016 ). The downstream signaling cascades that caused transcription of BDNF are currently unknown. A direct effect of physical exercise-induced cathepsin-B on LTP has not yet been investigated. 3.3.2.2. Acute exercise effect A single bout of high-intensity interval exercise ( Nicolini et al., 2020 ) or resistance exercise ( Johnson et al., 2020 ) did not alter cathepsin-B levels in healthy young male adults. 3.3.2.3. Chronic exercise effect Evidence for chronic exercise-induced changes in cathepsin-B levels is inconsistent. Moon et al. (2016) showed increased levels after cardiovascular training both peripherally and in the brain, while this was not confirmed by other authors ( Gourgouvelis et al., 2018 , Mees et al., 2019 , Nicolini et al., 2019 , Pena et al., 2020 ). Chronic resistance exercise was found to elevate cathepsin-B mRNA levels in muscle tissue ( Norheim et al., 2011 ) and increase circulating levels in obese females ( Kim and Kang, 2020 ). Again, other studies only found non-significant trends or no effect in female mice or humans ( Pena et al., 2020 , Micielska et al., 2021 ). 3.3.3. Apelin Apelin is synthesized in many tissues, such as muscle, adipose tissue, and the brain ( Masoumi et al., 2018 , Wysocka et al., 2018 , Halon-Golabek et al., 2019 ). It was reported to improve glucose homeostasis . Apelin levels were found to be increased in obesity and diabetes mellitus. This is suggested to be a compensatory mechanism to decrease insulin resistance ( Boucher et al., 2005 , Bertrand et al., 2015 ). Furthermore, apelin was suggested to be a biomarker for the diagnosis of aging-associated sarcopenia ( Vinel et al., 2018 ). Pro-apelin is cleaved into apelin-36, and then further processed into shorter isoforms. Apelin-13 may represent the adipose tissue-derived isoform. Apelin-13 synthesis was found to be upregulated in adipose tissue of male obese mice ( Shin et al., 2013 ). It is not clear which is the most expressed isoform in muscle tissue, but most researchers use non-specific measurements of apelin ( Bae et al., 2019 ). Muscle-derived apelin might also be able to cross the blood–brain barrier, as intraperitoneal injections have been shown to increase apelin concentrations in the hypothalamus ( Higuchi et al., 2007 ). However, none of the physical exercise studies we found searched for central apelin levels. 3.3.3.1. Pathway Apelin administration to brain-derived glial cells increased BDNF levels in vitro. Inhibition of the apelin receptor downregulated BDNF mRNA expression, indicating apelin might promote BDNF-mediated LTP facilitation ( Kwak et al., 2019 ). Another study also found that one week of daily intracerebroventricular injection of apelin increased hippocampal BDNF levels, as measured in vitro 24\xa0h after the last injection on hippocampal slices. In addition, this study also discovered that an antagonist of the TrkB-receptor blocked the ameliorative effect of apelin on memory performance in rats ( Shen et al., 2019 ). Furthermore, apelin has been shown to act via the PI3K and ERK signaling pathways in the hippocampus. The beneficial effect of intracerebroventricular apelin administration on depression and memory of stressed rats was blocked by pretreatment with PI3K or ERK1/2 inhibitors ( Li et al., 2016 ). At last, apelin is considered an anti-inflammatory agent counteracting the elevation of neuroinflammatory markers such as IL-1β and TNF-α, as occurring following brain injury ( Masoumi et al., 2018 ). No studies searched for a causal link between physical exercise-induced elevations of apelin and the facilitation of LTP. 3.3.3.2. Acute exercise effect Some studies reported that an acute bout of endurance ( Bilski et al., 2016 , Son et al., 2019 , Dundar et al., 2019a , Kon et al., 2020 ), sprint interval ( Kon et al., 2019 ), or resistance exercise ( Kechyn et al., 2015 , Fortunato et al., 2018 ) significantly increased apelin plasma levels. But levels did not significantly change in other studies ( Waller et al., 2019 ). 3.3.3.3. Chronic exercise effect A recent meta -analysis from Bae and colleagues (2019), including nine studies, showed that circulating apelin levels increased following physical exercise. They reported that all four studies including participants with a mean age between 50 and 60\xa0years old showed significant increases. In contrast, only one of the five studies including younger adults could replicate these results. Only two studies included resistance exercise, with one reporting non-significant changes and the other reporting a decrease in apelin levels ( Bae et al., 2019 ). In rat studies, apelin levels increased following chronic cardiovascular and resistance exercise ( Zhang et al., 2006 , Ji et al., 2016 , Son et al., 2017 , Vinel et al., 2018 , Kwak et al., 2019 , Sabouri et al., 2020 ). However, decreases following chronic cardiovascular or resistance exercise were also reported. Some studies in obese women reported declines of (non-isoform specific) apelin levels linked to physical exercise-induced weight loss ( Sheibani et al., 2012 , Jang et al., 2019 ), but physical exercise-induced decreases in apelin levels were more consistently linked to physical exercise-associated improvements of insulin resistance ( Krist et al., 2013 , Bertrand et al., 2015 , Delavar and Heidarianpour, 2016 , Otero-Díaz et al., 2018 , Kolahdouzi et al., 2019 , Nam et al., 2020 ). Moreover, it was shown that insulin directly drives the upregulation of adipocyte-derived apelin in a state of hyperinsulinemia ( Boucher et al., 2005 , Yang et al., 2015 ), while muscle tissue expresses apelin only following physical exercise ( Yang et al., 2015 ). As apelin has a beneficial effect on glucose homeostasis, adipocyte-derived apelin might have a role in limiting insulin resistance when it is already present, while muscle-derived apelin has the potential to prevent it. 3.3.4. Adiponectin Adiponectin is mainly released from adipose tissue. However, during physical exercise, it is also expressed and released from skeletal muscle ( Dai et al., 2013 ). Circulating adiponectin levels were lower in obese adults ( Yang et al., 2002 ). Adiponectin was found to be able to cross the blood–brain barrier and mediate hippocampal neurogenesis ( Yau et al., 2014 , Li et al., 2015 ). Moreover, it is considered an anti-inflammatory marker with beneficial effects on cardiovascular and metabolic disorders ( Ouchi and Walsh, 2007 ). 3.3.4.1. Pathway Intracerebroventricular injection adiponectin was found to facilitate LTP in anesthetized rats ( Pousti et al., 2018 ). Wang et al. (2019) showed that administration of adiponectin increased AMPA and NMDA surface expression on hippocampal slices. However, the intracellular signaling pathway activated by adiponectin remains unclear. It was suggested that adiponectin might enhance NMDA-receptor function via the PI3K/Akt pathway in the hippocampus ( Pousti et al., 2018 ), as this pathway was activated following intracerebroventricular adiponectin injection in an Alzheimer’s rat model ( Xu et al., 2018 ). Furthermore, multiple studies have shown that adiponectin has an anti-inflammatory effect on the brain ( Forny-Germano et al., 2019 ). Although these studies may suggest that adiponectin can mediate the exercise-cognition effect, no studies have currently provided direct evidence that changes in circulating adiponectin levels following physical exercise facilitate LTP. 3.3.4.2. Acute exercise effect In systematic reviews, acute cardiovascular exercise was found to increase adiponectin levels ( Simpson and Singh, 2008 , Bouassida et al., 2010 ). Simpson and Singh (2008) suggested that high-intensity exercise is required for the modulation of adiponectin levels. Bouassida et al. (2010) indicated that increases are only found following physical exercise bouts of less than 60\xa0min. We found only two studies that examined the effect of acute resistance exercise. Both did not show significant changes in adiponectin levels ( Mansouri et al., 2011 , Ihalainen et al., 2017 ). 3.3.4.3. Chronic exercise effect A meta -analysis showed that adiponectin expression increased following chronic cardiovascular exercise, but not following resistance exercise in prediabetic and diabetic adults ( Becic et al., 2018 ). A more recent meta -analysis also reported an overall increase of adiponectin levels following chronic exercise, but only included two studies with resistance exercise. In one of the two studies, resistance exercise induced significant increases in adiponectin levels ( Rahimi et al., 2021 ). However, quite some other studies not included in these meta -analyses did report significant increases in adiponectin levels after chronic resistance exercise ( Fatouros et al., 2005 , Ihalainen et al., 2017 , Galbreath et al., 2018 , Montrezol et al., 2019 , Park et al., 2019 ) or combined cardiovascular and resistance exercise protocols ( Markofski et al., 2014 , Dieli-Conwright et al., 2018a , Dieli-Conwright et al., 2018b , Ghayomzadeh et al., 2020 ). Of interest, Davis et al. (2015) reported that the combination of cardiovascular and resistance exercise was better at increasing adiponectin levels than resistance exercise alone. This might be explained by the finding from others that adiponectin increase was linked with fat loss ( Bouassida et al., 2010 , Christiansen et al., 2010 , Kelly et al., 2014 ). 3.4. Metabolites 3.4.1. Lactate Acute high-intensity exercise increases muscle-derived lactate levels ( Saucedo Marquez et al., 2015 , Albesa-Albiol et al., 2019 ). Next, lactate may cross the blood–brain barrier via monocarboxylate transporters . Interestingly, these transporters were found to be rapidly upregulated during an acute bout of physical exercise ( Takimoto and Hamada, 2014 ). Brain lactate levels were found to remain elevated more than 40\xa0min after vigorously intense physical exercise, while blood lactate levels had already dropped back to baseline ( Maddock et al., 2011 ). Brain lactate can also arise from astrocyte metabolism ( Müller et al., 2020 ). Lactate is transferred via monocarboxylate transporters from astrocytes towards neurons when energy demand is high, such as during memory formation. Pharmacological inhibition of monocarboxylate transporter 2 , the transporter that is found on neurons to admit lactate, impairs long-term memory formation ( Newman et al., 2011 ). 3.4.1.1. Pathway Increased blood lactate levels were found to correlate with circulating BDNF, IGF-1, GH, and VEGF ( Schiffer et al., 2011 , Salgueiro et al., 2014 , Kujach et al., 2020 ). Furthermore, lactate was found to increase the hippocampal levels of transcriptional coactivator PGC1α and its transcriptional product, FNDC5/irisin. As described in section 3.3.1, FNDC5/irisin is known to induce BDNF expression ( Wrann et al., 2013 ). Lactate acts by activating silent information regulator 1 (SIRT-1), a class III histone deacetylase ( El Hayek et al., 2019 ). El Hayek et al. (2019) discovered in male mice that SIRT-1 is activated by the NADH molecules that originate from the conversion of lactate back to pyruvate. Moreover, both protein and mRNA levels of SIRT-1 were increased following physical exercise and lactate infusion. The same effect was found after intraperitoneal injections of lactate at concentrations that induced increases in hippocampal lactate levels of the same level as found after physical exercise ( El Hayek et al., 2019 ). In addition, lactate was found to potentiate active NMDA receptors in cultured cortical neurons , thereby increasing the response of downstream signaling pathways, which are involved in the LTP process ( Yang et al., 2014 ). Lactate can also be used in the tricarboxycyclic acid cycle to produce intermediates that can be used for de novo synthesis of amino acid neurotransmitters such as glutamate and GABA ( Kleppner and Tobin, 2002 ). Finally, lactate may also reduce neuroinflammation by changing microglia toward their anti-inflammatory phenotype, see section 3.2.1 ( Errea et al., 2016 ). Lactate causes the addition of a lactyl group to the lysine amino-acid residues in the tails of histone proteins (i.e., histone lactylation) which stimulates genes of the anti-inflammatory phenotype in microglia ( Zhang et al., 2019 ). Lactate seems to activate several pathways associated with LTP. It can be used as a precursor to the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate and the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA ( Kleppner and Tobin, 2002 ), and physical exercise-induced elevations of lactate were reported to cause SIRT-1 activation. The physical exercise-induced activation of PGC1α and, in turn, FNDC5/irisin, which induces BDNF synthesis, were found to be dependent on SIRT-1 activation ( El Hayek et al., 2019 ). As increased levels of BDNF are linked with the facilitation of LTP, the effect of lactate can be inferred. However, none of these studies examined the direct link between the physical exercise-induced facilitation of LTP and lactate. 3.4.1.2. Acute exercise effect Both acute high-intensity cardiovascular exercise and resistance exercise are capable of increasing blood lactate levels at intensities above the anaerobic threshold ( Saucedo Marquez et al., 2015 , Albesa-Albiol et al., 2019 ). Animal studies confirmed acute cardiovascular exercise-induced increases in brain lactate levels in the cortex, hippocampus and hypothalamus ( Takimoto and Hamada, 2014 ). In humans, a difference between the carotid artery and jugular vein lactate levels indicated lactate is used within the brain during acute cardiovascular exercise ( Ide et al., 1999 , Ide et al., 2000 ). Moreover, magnetic resonance studies showed increased brain lactate levels after high-intensity cardiovascular exercise in the visual cortex ( Maddock et al., 2011 ). 3.4.1.3. Chronic exercise effect No effect on baseline levels of lactate after chronic exercise is to be expected. However, one study showed that mice with free access to a running wheel for 30\xa0days had higher in vitro hippocampal lactate concentrations than sedentary controls. Therefore, they suggested that lactate accumulates following chronic cardiovascular exercise in the hippocampus of male mice ( El Hayek et al., 2019 ). 3.4.2. β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) Ketone bodies , like BHB, are increased in the circulation and brain after fasting, dieting, and prolonged physical exercise ( Mitchell et al., 1995 ). Ketone bodies are produced in the liver. They are used as an energy source under conditions of reduced glucose levels ( Mitchell et al., 1995 ). Similar to lactate, also BHB penetrates the blood–brain barrier through the monocarboxylate transporter ( Takimoto and Hamada, 2014 ). As described in section 3.4.1, the activation of these transporters was found to increase following acute exercise ( Takimoto and Hamada, 2014 ). Of interest, BHB administration was found to improve cognitive function in rats ( Murray et al., 2016 , Hernandez et al., 2018 ). 3.4.2.1. Pathway BHB acts as a direct class I histone deacetylase inhibitor. It prevents the recruitment of histone deacetylase 2 and 3 to the BDNF promoter I. This way, BDNF gene transcription was increased following BHB administration or the elevation of circulating BHB levels after chronic exercise interventions, as was shown on mice and rat hippocampal cultures ( Sleiman et al., 2016 , Hu et al., 2018 , Lan et al., 2018 ). Moreover, it acts via the cAMP/PKA pathway to activate CREB ( Hu et al., 2018 ). Incubation of hippocampal slices with BHB increased excitatory synaptic transmission , which is related to LTP facilitation ( Sleiman et al., 2016 ). While Sleiman et al. (2016) both reported increased hippocampal BHB levels following physical exercise and facilitation of LTP following administration of BHB on hippocampal slices, they did not directly measure LTP activity following physical exercise. 3.4.2.2. Acute exercise effect An acute bout of prolonged cardiovascular exercise was found to increase BHB blood ( Mitchell et al., 1995 , Nybo et al., 2003 , Kim et al., 2013 ) and brain ( Nybo et al., 2003 , Takimoto and Hamada, 2014 ) levels in animal and humans (arterial and jugular venous blood level differences). All of these studies used male animals or human subjects. Nybo et al. (2003) reported that the effect was absent when exercising subjects received carbohydrate supplementation. One study showed that acute resistance exercise also increased BHB levels in men ( Tsekouras et al., 2009 ). 3.4.2.3. Chronic exercise effect In old male mice, BHB serum levels increased following a 4-week physical exercise program in endurance trained, but not in resistance trained animals ( Kwak et al., 2021 ). However, in combination with a low calorie diet, both cardiovascular and resistance training were found to increase BHB levels ( Jo et al., 2019 , Vieira et al., 2021 ). Furthermore, elastic band exercise, which was considered a hybrid form of physical exercise between cardiovascular and resistance training, increased BHB serum levels in women with low pre-exercise BHB concentrations ( Kwak et al., 2021 ). Finally, BHB was found to accumulate in the hippocampus of male mice after a chronic cardiovascular exercise program ( Sleiman et al., 2016 , Lan et al., 2018 ). Non-significant trends of increased blood and brain BHB levels after chronic cardiovascular exercise are also reported ( Béland-Millar et al., 2020 ). 3.5. Other exerkines 3.5.1. Osteocalcin Osteocalcin is a bone-derived hormone. It is secreted by osteoblasts during bone resorption . It can be found in blood in active (uncarboxylated) and decarboxylated forms ( Khrimian et al., 2017 ). The uncarboxylated form of osteocalcin was found to cross the blood–brain barrier. There, it enhances the synthesis of monoamine neurotransmitters (serotonin and catecholamines), but inhibits the synthesis of GABA. This was found to favor learning in adult mice ( Oury et al., 2013 ). In mice, baseline osteocalcin serum levels were found to decrease with age ( Mera et al., 2016 ). Recent studies in humans also discovered an association between lower levels of osteocalcin and brain atrophy and cognitive performance decline ( Puig et al., 2016 , Fang et al., 2018 ). Bradburn and colleagues (2016) reported that lower levels of plasma osteocalcin were only associated with cognitive decline in older women, but not in older men or young adults ( Bradburn et al., 2016 ). However, another study including mainly older women (85% female, 15% male) with cognitive decline did not find an association between cognitive function and total or uncarboxylated osteocalcin ( Ross et al., 2018 ). For more information on the osteocalcin-cognition link, see review papers by Shan et al., 2019 , Nakamura et al., 2020 . 3.5.1.1. Pathway Osteocalcin was shown to bind to the G-protein-coupled receptor (Gpcr158) on cultured hippocampal neurons ( Khrimian et al., 2017 ). Osteocalcin treatment on these cultured hippocampal neurons resulted in an enhancement of hippocampal BDNF and BDNF mRNA expression and fastened trafficking of BDNF-containing vesicles to synapses. The peripheral injection of osteocalcin also improved memory function in old mice ( Khrimian et al., 2017 ). Moreover, greater physical exercise-induced increases in the active, uncarboxylated form of osteocalcin were found to be associated with higher serum BDNF levels in young healthy men ( Nicolini et al., 2020 ). However, no studies examined the direct effect of physical exercise-induced elevations in circulating osteocalcin on LTP activity. 3.5.1.2. Acute exercise effect The circulating levels of uncarboxylated osteocalcin were found to double during acute cardiovascular exercise in young mice, whereas in older mice, the response was much lower ( Mera et al., 2016 ). In humans, a bout of moderate to high-intensity cardiovascular exercise was found to increase uncarboxylated osteocalcin in males ( Levinger et al., 2014a ; Nicolini et al., 2020 ; Smith et al., 2021 ) and females ( Jürimäe et al., 2016 , Smith et al., 2021 ). Smith et al. (2021) reviewed studies with middle-aged and older adults reporting total, uncarboxylated, and carboxylated osteocalcin levels following acute exercise. They described that total osteocalcin levels increased more in middle-aged than in older adults and more in men than in women ( Smith et al., 2021 ). Osteocalcin levels did not change following acute resistance exercise ( Levinger et al., 2011 , Rogers et al., 2011 ). The recent systematic review of Smith et al. (2021) only included one study on acute resistance exercise. Hence, more studies are needed to confirm that acute resistance exercise is incapable of increasing circulating osteocalcin. 3.5.1.3. Chronic exercise effect A meta -analytic study showed that both chronic cardiovascular and resistance exercise were found to increase basal levels of circulating uncarboxylated osteocalcin ( Rahimi et al., 2021 ). In the study of Lester et al. (2009) , only resistance exercise or resistance exercise combined with cardiovascular exercise, but not cardiovascular exercise alone, resulted in increased levels of osteocalcin. Furthermore, baseline uncarboxylated osteocalcin levels were positively associated with muscle strength, which might indicate that chronic resistance exercise is the better approach to induce uncarboxylated osteocalcin ( Karlsson et al., 1995 , Levinger et al., 2014b ). 3.5.2. Orexin-A/Hypocretin-1 Orexin-A is synthesized by neurons in the hypothalamus ( Chieffi et al., 2017 ) or gastro-intestinal tract ( Nakabayashi et al., 2003 ), and by the pancreatic islets ( Dall’Aglio et al., 2010 ). Orexin-A levels are decreased in obese and sedentary humans, whereas high levels are associated with improved cognitive performance ( Polito et al., 2020 ). The origin of the peripheral rise in orexin A levels induced by physical exercise is not well known. However, it has been suggested to be induced by sympathetic nervous system activation ( Messina et al., 2016 ). It may be released in the bloodstream from the pituitary ( Tsunematsu and Yamanaka, 2012 ), leak from cerebrospinal fluid ( Chieffi et al., 2017 ), or diffuse through the blood–brain barrier ( Kastin and Akerstrom, 1999 ). 3.5.2.1. Pathway Hippocampal orexin-A infusion was reported to enhance the response to LTP induction by electrophysiological stimuli in vivo in anesthetized rats, which was blocked by a specific orexin-A receptor-1 antagonist ( Wayner et al., 2004 ). The same antagonist also decreased LTP in freely moving rats, as measured with two electrodes over the perforant pathway (i.e., the connectional route from the entorhinal cortex to the hippocampal formation) ( Akbari et al., 2011 ). In a mouse model in which orexin-producing neurons degenerate by three months of age, in vitro hippocampal LTP magnitude and the level of phosphorylated CREB were decreased. This suggests a role of orexin-A in CREB-mediated transcription ( Yang et al., 2013 ). In vitro electrophysiological recordings with and without administration of orexin receptor 1 +\xa0and 2, and PLC and PKA antagonists suggested that orexin-A mediates this effect on LTP by the PLC-pathway via orexin receptor-1 and cAMP/PKA-pathway via orexin receptor-2 ( Lu et al., 2016 ). Currently, a possible link between the physical exercise-induced increase of orexin-A and the facilitation of LTP-related pathways can only be inferred from these models, as no studies exist that examined the direct link between those two. 3.5.2.2. Acute exercise effect An acute bout of cardiovascular exercise was found to increase circulating orexin-A levels in young sedentary men ( Messina et al., 2016 ) and cerebrospinal fluid levels in animals ( Wu et al., 2002 , Martins et al., 2004 ). 3.5.2.3. Chronic exercise effect We found only one study that showed that chronic cardiovascular exercise increases circulating Orexin-A levels in healthy middle-aged men and men with metabolic syndrome ( Monda et al., 2020 ). 3.5.3. Ghrelin Ghrelin is mainly produced in the stomach before meals and released into circulation ( Cummings et al., 2001 ). It stimulates appetite and enhances the secretion of GH from the pituitary gland ( Kojima et al., 1999 ). Peripheral ghrelin may cross the blood–brain barrier, but it may also be synthesized in the brain itself ( Ribeiro et al., 2014 ). It has been shown to have neuroprotective properties ( Santos et al., 2017 ) and enhance the response to LTP induction by electrophysiological stimuli in the hippocampus ( Diano et al., 2006 , Chen et al., 2011 ). 3.5.3.1. Pathway Ghrelin binds to the growth hormone secretagogue type 1a receptor in the pituitary ( Kojima et al., 1999 ), where it induces the release of GH (see section 3.1.3) and in the hippocampus ( Guan et al., 1997 ), where it increases memory retention ( Diano et al., 2006 , Chen et al., 2011 ). Intraperitoneal injection of ghrelin resulted in hippocampal elevations of IGF-1 and IGF-1 mRNA levels (see Section 3.1.2 ). In cultured rat hippocampal neurons, Ribeiro et al. (2014) showed that GHS-1a receptors are found on the excitatory synapse. GHS-1a receptor activation by ghrelin administration resulted in the increase and phosphorylation of AMPA receptors in the postsynaptic density , enhancing excitatory synaptic transmission. This effect was mediated by the PLC/IP3, PLC/PKC, PLC/PI3K, and cAMP/PKA-pathways ( Ribeiro et al., 2014 ). No studies were found that assessed the influence of physical exercise-induced ghrelin on LTP-related pathways. 3.5.3.2. Acute exercise effect Autio et al. (2020) recently reviewed the effect of physical exercise on ghrelin levels. They indicated that acute cardiovascular and resistance exercise lowered circulating ghrelin levels in some studies. In contrast, Erdmann et al. (2007) suggested a role of physical exercise intensity, showing increased ghrelin levels after low-intensity cardiovascular exercise below the aerobic threshold. Also Toshinai et al. (2007) showed intensity dependent effects on ghrelin levels in healthy men, with higher intensity physical exercise inducing a greater suppression of ghrelin levels, associated with higher adrenalin and noradrenalin levels. 3.5.3.3. Chronic exercise effect Chronic cardiovascular and resistance exercise were found to increase baseline plasma ghrelin levels ( Ravussin et al., 2001 , Martins et al., 2010 , Kim et al., 2014 , Moraes et al., 2015 , Dundar et al., 2019b , Tremblay et al., 2019 ) and cardiovascular exercise increased 24\xa0h measurements of ghrelin (i.e., the sum of all serum ghrelin levels measured in blood obtained every 20\xa0min for a duration of 24\xa0h) ( Leidy et al., 2007 ). Some authors reported that only those with significant weight loss had increased ghrelin levels after chronic exercise ( Leidy et al., 2004 , Foster-Schubert et al., 2005 , Scheid et al., 2011 ). 3.5.4. Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) VIP is a peptide with vasodilatory function, which is secreted by nerve endings in the gastrointestinal tract, heart, lungs, thyroid, urinary bladder, kidney, genital organs, and brain ( Said and Mutt, 1970 , Henning and Sawmiller, 2001 ). VIP was found to cross the blood–brain barrier only unidirectionally from blood towards the brain ( Dogrukol-Ak et al., 2003 ). Within the brain, it may potentiate LTP-related pathways ( Cunha-Reis and Caulino-Rocha, 2020 ). 3.5.4.1. Pathway In the hippocampus, VIP is known to activate the VIP receptor 1, VAPC1, and VIP receptor 2 , VAPC2. VAPC1 activated PLC/IP3 and PLC/PKC-signaling, while VAPC2 induced the cAMP/PKA-pathway in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells ( Cunha-Reis et al., 2005 ). In vitro administration of VIP on CA1 cells activated these receptors and resulted in increased synaptic transmission by enhancing NMDA currents ( Yang et al., 2009 ). Inhibition of PKC or PKA attenuated the VIP-mediated enhancement of synaptic transmission ( Cunha-Reis et al., 2005 ). For a review concerning the facilitating action of VIP on LTP and LTP-related pathways, we refer to Cunha-Reis and Caulino-Rocha (2020) . However, we found no studies that assessed the direct effect of physical exercise-induced VIP elevations on LTP-related pathways. 3.5.4.2. Acute exercise effect A bout of cardiovascular exercise until exhaustion, submaximal muscular exercise, and an acute bout of low-intensity cardiovascular exercise of long duration were found to increase circulating VIP levels in men ( Galbo et al., 1979 , Woie et al., 1986 , Rolandi et al., 1988 , MacLaren et al., 1995 ). The acute exercise-associated rise in circulating VIP was suggested to result from the overflow of the peptide at skeletal muscle blood vessels, where it acts as a potent vasodilator ( Woie et al., 1986 ). 3.5.4.3. Chronic exercise effect A five-day period of physical exercise with calorie deficiency and sleep deprivation induced increases in VIP levels in male military cadets ( Øktedalen et al., 1983a , Øktedalen et al., 1983b ). However, calorie compensation lowered the VIP increase ( Øktedalen et al., 1983a ). An eight-week program of low-intensity cardiovascular exercise did not induce increases in VIP serum levels ( Amirazodi et al., 2019 ). 4. Concluding remarks This review describes current evidence for the role of exerkines in mediating the neurophysiological processes leading to LTP that occur in the brain following physical exercise. It is important to note that we only reported a small fraction of all the processes that exerkines may induce in the brain. Furthermore, we discussed only LTP processes at the glutamatergic excitatory synapse and did not refer in our review to mechanisms and pathways of neurogenesis, LTD-related processes, or processes at the GABAergic inhibitory synapse. Yet, LTP and neurogenesis are somewhat related, as neurogenesis may be boosted by the growth factors that are synthesized in neurons during LTP ( Cho et al., 2013 ), and newly formed neurons appear to depend on LTP for their survival and maturation ( Shors et al., 2012 , Denoth-Lippuner and Jessberger, 2021 ). In comparison with LTP and the modulatory effects of exerkines on pathways at the glutamatergic synapse, evidence for exerkine effects on LTD or changes in the GABAergic synapse is limited. However, some processes and pathways that were described in this review may also be implicated in up- or downregulation of GABAergic transmission , e.g., studies have reported an effect of lactate on GABA levels ( Maddock et al., 2016 , Coxon et al., 2018 ), and of BDNF on GABAergic modulation ( Vaz et al., 2011 ). Furthermore, evidence is still lacking regarding the effect that physical exercise-induced elevations of GABA concentrations in cortical neurons, measured with 1 H-MRS, may have on GABAergic neurotransmission ( Maddock et al., 2016 ). On the one hand, lactate may be converted to GABA, which is expected to increase its availability in presynaptic terminals and strengthen GABA-mediated inhibitory control ( Kleppner and Tobin, 2002 , Maddock et al., 2016 ). On the other hand, findings generated from studies involving non-invasive brain stimulation methods such as TMS demonstrated an overall downregulation of GABAergic activity following an acute bout of cardiovascular exercise (e.g., Singh et al., 2014a , Mooney et al., 2016 , Stavrinos and Coxon, 2017 , O’Leary et al., 2018 ; for a review see Levin et al. 2021 ). Although the LTP process has extensively been studied, for example, in relation to neuroplasticity , its relationship with exerkines needs further exploration. Most studies involve animal models and have investigated the effect of administration of a specific exerkine on the alteration of LTP-related pathways, but do not offer direct evidence that the physical exercise-induced increase of this exerkine may also alter LTP-related pathways. More specifically, only for three of the 16 exerkines presented in this review (BDNF, irisin, and pro-inflammatory cytokines), we found evidence suggesting that the physical exercise-related change in circulating exerkine levels was associated with the facilitation or impairment of LTP activity. In mice, elevated levels of BDNF ( Novkovic et al., 2015 ) and irisin ( Lourenco et al., 2019 ) following chronic exercise facilitated LTP activity and elevated levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-1β following seven days of daily maximal cardiovascular exercise were reported to have detrimental effects on LTP activity ( Sun et al., 2017 ). In other studies, the exerkine-effect on LTP activity was only reported following in vitro administration of the exerkine. However, the physical exercise-induced elevation of only four of the 16 exerkines included in this review (IGF-1, BHB, lactate, and irisin) was found to activate the transcription of one of the exerkines with known physical exercise-induced facilitatory effect on LTP (i.e., BDNF or irisin). For example, BDNF transcription in rodent brain was associated with physical exercise-induced elevations of IGF-1 ( Ding et al., 2006 ), irisin ( Wrann et al., 2013 ), and BHB ( Sleiman et al., 2016 ) following chronic exercise and with the physical exercise-induced elevation of IGF-1 ( Carro et al., 2001 ) following acute exercise. Furthermore, neural synthesis of irisin was suggested to be an effect of physical exercise-induced elevations in lactate, measured after 30\xa0days of voluntary physical exercise in mice( El Hayek et al., 2019 ). Of note, physical exercise-induced elevations in irisin were both found to enhance the response to electrophysiological stimulation of LTP ( Lourenco et al., 2019 ) and to mediate hippocampal BDNF transcription ( Wrann et al., 2013 ). Thus, the faciliatory effect of irisin on LTP activity may be indirect by the induction of a rise in BDNF levels. The circulating levels of the ten remaining exerkines were found to be altered by physical exercise, but at present, none of the studies measured their role in the physical exercise-induced facilitation of LTP activity. Current evidence about the role of these exerkines on LTP is mainly derived from studies, in which these exerkines were administered in vitro and subsequent changes in LTP activity (in case of GH, kynurenine, adiponectin, orexin-A, ghrelin, and VIP) or BDNF levels (in case of cathepsin-B, apelin, and osteocalcin) were found ( Wayner et al., 2004 , Diano et al., 2006 , Rózsa et al., 2008 , Kim et al., 2010 , Chen et al., 2011 , Molina et al., 2012 , Moon et al., 2016 , Khrimian et al., 2017 , Pousti et al., 2018 , Kwak et al., 2019 , Cunha-Reis and Caulino-Rocha, 2020 , Nicolini et al., 2020 ). Of note, there were some inconsistencies in the reported effect of physical exercise on exerkine levels. Some differences might be due to the discrepancy in the quantification of biomarkers, timing of sample collection, pre-analytic sample processing, the analytical method, and calculation of other factors ( Son et al., 2018 ). As an example, studies have described how BDNF levels may differ between measurements due to circadian variability, the time between blood collection and centrifugation , or whether BDNF was measured in serum or in plasma ( Cain et al., 2017 , Gejl et al., 2019 ). Of importance, the time between the last physical exercise bout and sample collection is often not clearly denoted in chronic exercise studies. However, this is critical to differentiate between changes in exerkine levels that represent acute exercise effects in trained individuals and changes in baseline exerkine levels as a function of chronic exercise. Acute exercise may transiently change exerkine levels lasting for minutes up to more than 24\xa0h after physical exercise ( Garneau et al., 2020 ). To accurately measure longer-lasting changes in baseline exerkine levels induced by chronic exercise, we would advise having at least one, but preferably two or more full rest days between blood sample collection and the last physical exercise bout. Chronic intervention studies should also consider adding follow-up measurements several months after the end of the intervention in order to examine whether exerkine levels return to their pre-intervention levels or remain elevated. In addition to the differences in blood sampling methods, there is a large heterogeneity in the physical exercise protocols and study subjects’ characteristics, which vary according to the study’s objectives. It is interesting to learn which type of physical exercise works best to change a certain exerkine in a certain population as this may lead to the design of individualized physical exercise protocols. The ultimate goal for individualized physical exercise training is to find a physical exercise protocol that works best to improve performance or prevent a specific type of cognitive or motor deficit in a specific population. In young and healthy older adults, the primary aim may be the improvement or acquisition of certain skills that has been shown to be associated with LTP induction during the memory consolidation phase (e.g., Statton et al., 2015 ; for a review, see Wanner et al., 2020 ). For older adults with neurodegenerative disorders or abnormal cognitive decline, physical exercise may have more specific functional/therapeutic goals (e.g., inhibit inflammation or improve cardiovascular function). In the following paragraphs, we will discuss what we can learn from the literature that was summarized in this review paper. As we did not review the link between certain domains of cognitive function and specific exerkines, our discussion will be limited to the effect of physical exercise and subject characteristics on the release of these exerkines into circulation. Where possible, the association between these physical exercises and subject characteristics and LTP will be highlighted. First, different modes of physical exercise (i.e., cardiovascular versus resistance exercise) are expected to activate different regulatory pathways. Kim and colleagues (2019) argued that resistance exercise may be better in promoting the release of myokines, while cardiovascular exercise may have a greater influence on other exerkines such as adiponectin ( Davis et al., 2015 , Kim et al., 2019 ). Compared with resistance exercise, the beneficial effect of cardiovascular exercise on the brain may, to a greater extent, be attributed to improvements in cardiovascular function or changes in energy metabolism, such as increased delivery of nutrients and oxygen ( Kim et al., 2019 ). From our review, it becomes clear that the evidence on exerkine release during and following acute and chronic resistance exercise is limited compared to cardiovascular exercise. Therefore, it is not possible to draw final conclusions. However, it was argued that resistance training is an essential component of the physical exercise program to boost BDNF levels in older ( Marinus et al., 2019 ) and osteocalcin levels in young adults ( Lester et al., 2009 ). Acute or chronic resistance exercise was preferred to boost IGF-1 ( de Alcantara Borba et al., 2020 , Gulick et al., 2020 , Jiang et al., 2020 ) and acute resistance exercise resulted in larger irisin level increases than cardiovascular exercise ( Tsuchiya et al., 2015 ). In contrast, adiponectin levels were found to increase to a greater extent if physical exercise contained a component of cardiovascular exercise, compared with resistance exercise alone ( Davis et al., 2015 ). Second, physical exercise intensity was reported to influence the release of exerkines. Acute exercise of higher intensity was associated with higher circulating levels of lactate ( Saucedo Marquez et al., 2015 , Albesa-Albiol et al., 2019 ), irisin ( Daskalopoulou et al., 2014 , Huh et al., 2014 ) and adiponectin ( Simpson and Singh, 2008 ). While some studies reported that BDNF levels were higher following acute high-intense versus low-intense physical exercise, e.g., Schmolesky et al. (2013) , the meta -analysis of Dinoff et al. (2017) only found a nonsignificant positive trend (p\xa0=\xa00.085) between BDNF levels and higher physical exercise intensity. In general, the release of exerkines is expected to require a certain physical exercise intensity before protein synthesis is activated. However, higher intensity is not always better. For example, ghrelin levels increased more following low-intense acute exercise compared with high-intense physical exercise in the study of Toshinai et al. (2007) . Furthermore, chronic high-intense physical exercise without the necessary recovery periods (i.e., overtraining) was associated with increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, with detrimental effects on LTP ( Sun et al., 2017 ). Third, longer physical exercise duration was associated with higher levels of BDNF following acute exercise intervention. Also in chronic exercise interventions, the length of the intervention may influence the change in baseline exerkine levels. For example, a meta -analysis reporting the effect of resistance exercise on irisin levels described that irisin levels significantly increased in interventions lasting less than 12\xa0weeks and decreased in physical exercise interventions lasting longer than 16\xa0weeks ( Cosio et al., 2021 ). Two studies had reported decreased irisin levels. Both were not only of long duration (6\xa0months or more), but also used low-intense physical exercise sessions without progression in intensity ( Hecksteden et al., 2013 , Scharhag-Rosenberger et al., 2014 ). Hence, it is possible that the physical exercise intensity level, known to affect irisin response ( Daskalopoulou et al., 2014 , Huh et al., 2014 ), may have had a higher impact on the irisin levels than the physical exercise duration. Fourth, age is considered to play an important role in how our body responds to physical exercise. Furthermore, the effect of age is widely studied with respect to LTP. For example, in old compared with young rodents , in vitro radioligand binding studies have shown a significant age-related loss of postsynaptic glutamatergic receptors, especially of the NMDA subtype, which is critical for the LTP process ( Kito et al., 1990 , Cohen and Müller, 1992 ). In addition, in vitro electrophysiological studies found LTP induction deficits in hippocampal slices of old rats compared with their younger counterparts ( Deupree et al., 1993 , Moore et al., 1993 ). Increasing age is also linked with a decrease in the baseline levels of myokines and growth factors, with BDNF as the cornerstone ( Tapia-Arancibia et al., 2008 , Erickson et al., 2010 , El-Sayes et al., 2019 ). However, higher physical exercise-induced elevations were found in older adults for IGF-1 following chronic resistance exercise ( Jiang et al., 2020 , Ye et al., 2020 , Amiri et al., 2021 ), for irisin following chronic cardiovascular ( Miyamoto-Mikami et al., 2015 ) and resistance exercise ( Cosio et al., 2021 ), and for apelin following chronic cardiovascular exercise ( Bae et al., 2019 ). In contrast, GH ( Wideman et al., 2002 ) and total osteocalcin ( Smith et al., 2021 ) increase following acute exercise were lower in older adults compared with young or middle-aged adults. Furthermore, in the process of aging, persons gradually progress into a more pro-inflammatory state. For example, the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β was found to be increased in old rats, and the concentration of dentate gyrus IL-1β was inversely related to the level of hippocampal LTP measured in vivo ( Murray and Lynch, 1998 ). From a mechanistic perspective, chronic inflammation was found to damage neurons and impair neurotrophic factor signaling ( Cotman et al., 2007 , Bourgognon and Cavanagh, 2020 , Scheiblich et al., 2020 ). Of note, older adults may also be more vulnerable to the pro-inflammatory effects of acute high-intense physical exercise. For example, Trepci et al. (2020) found increased levels of the inflammatory marker kynurenine 60\xa0min after acute sprint interval exercise in old but not in young healthy human subjects ( Trepci et al., 2020 ). Fifth, gender differences may influence the effect of physical exercise. As with aging, also gender may influence the baseline levels of certain exerkines. As a result, significant pre-to-post physical exercise changes are more easily found in the gender with the lowest baseline levels ( Glud et al., 2019 ). This was reported for BDNF ( Dinoff et al., 2017 ); baseline BDNF levels were found to be influenced by estrogen levels, with women having higher basal serum BDNF levels than men ( Harte-Hargrove et al., 2013 , Dong et al., 2017 , Glud et al., 2019 ). In addition, we found studies reporting higher acute exercise-induced increases of BDNF ( Dinoff et al., 2017 ) and total osteocalcin ( Smith et al., 2021 ) in men and higher chronic resistance exercise-induced increases of IGF-1 in women ( Jiang et al., 2020 , Ye et al., 2020 , Amiri et al., 2021 ). It is remarkable to note that the majority of studies were conducted using male human subjects or animals. Therefore, while some studies reported gender-related differences in exerkine responses following physical exercise, gender-related differences are unknown for most of them. Sixth, it was reported that if the physical exercise intervention induced weight loss, the circulating levels of irisin ( Cosio et al., 2021 ), adiponectin ( Bouassida et al., 2010 , Christiansen et al., 2010 , Kelly et al., 2014 ), and ghrelin ( Leidy et al., 2004 , Foster-Schubert et al., 2005 , Scheid et al., 2011 ) increased, while apelin levels of obese women decreased in association with significant weight loss ( Sheibani et al., 2012 , Jang et al., 2019 ). However, decreases in apelin levels were more consistently associated with the improvements in insulin sensitivity caused by physical exercise ( Krist et al., 2013 , Bertrand et al., 2015 , Delavar and Heidarianpour, 2016 , Otero-Díaz et al., 2018 , Kolahdouzi et al., 2019 , Nam et al., 2020 ). More specifically, it is thought that adipocyte-derived apelin is positively associated with insulin resistance ( Boucher et al., 2005 , Yang et al., 2015 ). It remains unclear if the muscle-derived isoform of apelin would also be responsive to changes in insulin sensitivity. Glucose metabolism also plays a role in the release of BHB, with higher levels of BHB found following acute exercise sessions that cause hypoglycemia and long physical exercise sessions without carbohydrate supplementation ( Nybo et al., 2003 ), or in chronic exercise in association with low calorie diet ( Jo et al., 2019 , Vieira et al., 2021 ). Importantly, diabetes mellitus and obesity are both also associated with a pro-inflammatory state ( Yudkin, 2007 , Woods et al., 2012 , Pedersen, 2017 ) which may affect LTP ( Murray and Lynch, 1998 , Sun et al., 2017 , Bourgognon and Cavanagh, 2020 ). Furthermore, these cardiovascular risk profiles were linked with cognitive decline ( Jefferson et al., 2015 , Viticchi et al., 2015 , Chatterjee et al., 2016 ) and with structural brain alterations ( Cox et al., 2019 ). Future studies should address whether the cognitive decline in persons with obesity, diabetes mellitus or other cardiovascular risk factors is related to impairments in LTP and the extent by which LTP is compromised by elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. 5. Future directions We reviewed a total of 16 different exerkines that were linked to the LTP process. However, the number of myokines currently discovered alone exceeds 600 ( Görgens et al., 2015 ). Researchers should keep exploring the specific bioactivity of exerkines on body systems. Especially, their effect on the central nervous system remains largely undescribed. Unfortunately, technical issues limit the investigation of exerkine effects on the human brain. Only some exerkines can be measured in humans with noninvasive techniques such as 1 H-MRS, e.g., lactate and BHB ( Dacko and Lange, 2019 ). Invasive alternatives that may be used in patient groups, but are not commonly used in research, are cerebrospinal fluid measurements (e.g., Steensberg et al., 2006 , Isung et al., 2021 ) and carotid artery versus jugular vein differences (e.g., Ide et al., 1999 , Ide et al., 2000 ). Hence, most evidence for exerkine changes in the brain arises from animal studies. However, most studies included in this review, which examined the effect of exerkines on LTP, did not measure the physical exercise-induced elevation, but administered the exerkine in vitro on brain slices or by the use of intravenous injections. More clinical and preclinical (physical exercise) research is needed to increase understanding of the effects that exerkines have on the brain and LTP activity. In addition to the exerkines presented in this review, other review papers have presented exerkines that are worth further investigation, as their effect on the LTP process is currently unclear ( Woodbury and Ikezu, 2014 , Morland et al., 2017 , Pedersen, 2019 , Autio et al., 2020 , Kwon et al., 2020 , da Scheffer and Latini, 2020 ). There is a relatively lower amount of studies examining resistance exercise effects compared with cardiovascular exercise effects. For example, in rodent studies, which are crucial to increase insight into the neurophysiological pathways that are modulated by physical exercise or exerkines, the resistance exercise protocol (most often weighted ladder climbing) is much less used than the cardiovascular exercise protocol (i.e., treadmill running). More specifically, we found only two studies that examined brain exerkine levels after acute resistance exercise ( Fernandes et al., 2016 , Kelty et al., 2019 ). In addition, studies comparing resistance and cardiovascular protocols are needed to make final decisions on differences between cardiovascular and resistance exercise effects. These studies comparing both protocols are scarce, e.g., Tang et al., 2017 , Joisten et al., 2020 , Tsuchiya et al., 2015 , Davis et al., 2015 , Lester et al., 2009 . Also, only for some exerkines there are sufficient high-quality studies to make valuable comparisons in meta -analytic studies, like for BDNF ( Dinoff et al., 2016 , 2017), IGF-1 ( de Alcantara Borba et al., 2020 , Gulick et al., 2020 , Jiang et al., 2020 , Ye et al., 2020 , Amiri et al., 2021 ), and osteocalcin ( Rahimi et al., 2021 ). But again, the reason for this is the limited number of studies using resistance exercise protocols. In sum, we need more clinical and preclinical research to focus on the effect of exerkines following resistance exercise on cognitive improvements and changes in LTP activity. Especially as more and more evidence suggests that resistance exercise might be the preferred physical exercise mode to boost certain of the exerkines ( Tsuchiya et al., 2015 , Kim et al., 2019 , Marinus et al., 2019 , de Alcantara Borba et al., 2020 , Gulick et al., 2020 , Jiang et al., 2020 ). This review did not focus on specific disorders that may cause acute or progressive deficits in cognitive function, such as neurodegenerative disorders, stroke, or traumatic brain injury . Yet, more insight into the effect of physical exercise in these specific cases would be of value for rehabilitation practitioners. In addition, certain exerkines may benefit specific domains of cognitive function. This was not discussed in this review, as we focused specifically on the alteration of LTP-related pathways. The combined evaluation of which physical exercise protocol would be most optimal to target specific exerkines and the evaluation of which exerkine could benefit a specific cognitive function may direct researchers towards the design of individualized physical exercise programs that can be implemented as a treatment strategy. Due to the large heterogeneity in possible physical exercise protocols, many more studies will be needed before such physical exercise treatment can be designed. For example, physical exercise characteristics that should be considered are intensity, duration, frequency, and the amount or size of the muscles used. Also physical exercise type can be further divided into specific sports. While running might be only slightly different from cycling, bigger differences can be expected when using hybrid forms of physical exercise between cardiovascular and resistance training, like elastic band exercises ( Kwak et al., 2021 ), or types of physical exercise that require memorizing movement patterns like dancing ( Kimura and Hozumi, 2012 ) or Tai Chi ( Wayne et al., 2014 ), or a combination of physical and cognitive training ( Netz, 2019 ). At last, increasing insight on the effects of exerkines on our body may lead to the design of pharmacological pills containing exerkines to mimic the effects of physical exercise. This may be especially useful in those unable to perform physical exercise at a sufficient duration and intensity, as recently reviewed by Gubert and Hannan (2021) . 6. Summary We reviewed physical exercise-induced circulating factors (i.e., exerkines) and their effect on LTP-related pathways ( Fig. 2 ). For each of these exerkines we assessed the physical exercise and subject characteristics that influence the alterations of exerkine levels in the circulation and the brain following acute or chronic, cardiovascular or resistance exercise ( Table 1 ). By combining and structuring evidence from a large and rapidly increasing amount of research, this review summarizes what is already sufficiently known and where research is limited. This knowledge may serve to guide researchers towards designing an individualized physical exercise treatment to improve cognitive health. The beneficial effect of physical exercise on cognitive function is only one of the many reasons to promote physical activity for people of all ages, especially in adults with cognitive decline. This is very important in a society that faces the prospect of an aging population.

This hormone is considered to be critical for neuroplastic processes in the adult brain (Frater et al., 2018; Vints et al., 2022b). Like the age-related increases in inflammation in our blood circulation, the age-related reduction in circulating IGF-1 levels is also suggested to play a role in cognitive aging (Frater et al., 2018). Show abstract Obesity and sarcopenia are associated with cognitive impairments at older age. Current research suggests that blood biomarkers may mediate this body-brain crosstalk, altering neurometabolism and brain structure eventually resulting in cognitive performance changes. Seventy-four older adults (60–85\xa0years old) underwent bio-impedance body composition analysis, handgrip strength measurements, 8-Foot Up-and-Go (8UG) test, Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), blood analysis of interleukin-6 (IL-6), kynurenine, and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), as well as brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( 1 H-MRS), estimating neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation. Normal fat% or overweight was associated with larger total gray matter volume compared to underweight or obesity in older adults and obesity was associated with higher N-acetylaspartate/Creatine levels in the sensorimotor and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Muscle strength, not muscle mass/physical performance, corresponded to lower kynurenine and higher N-acetylaspartate/Creatine levels in the dorsal posterior cingulate and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. The inflammatory and neurotrophic blood biomarkers did not significantly mediate these body-brain associations.

Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is an essential neurotrophin that is also intimately connected with central and peripheral molecular processes of energy metabolism and homeostasis, and could play a crucial role in these induced mechanisms. This review provides an overview of the current knowledge on the effects of acute exercise and/or training on BDNF in healthy subjects and in persons with a chronic disease or disability. A systematic and critical literature search was conducted. Articles were considered for inclusion in the review if they were human studies, assessed peripheral (serum and/or plasma) BDNF and evaluated an acute exercise or training intervention. Nine RCTs, one randomized trial, five non-randomized controlled trials, five non-randomized non-controlled trials and four retrospective observational studies were analysed. Sixty-nine percent of the studies in healthy subjects and 86%of the studies in persons with a chronic disease or disability, showed a ‘mostly transient’ increase in serum or plasma BDNF concentration following an acute aerobic exercise. The two studies regarding a single acute strength exercise session could not show a significant influence on basal BDNF concentration. In studies regarding the effects of strength or aerobic training on BDNF, a difference should be made between effects on basal BDNF concentration and training-induced effects on the BDNF response following an acute exercise. Only three out of ten studies on aerobic or strength training (i.e. 30%) found a training-induced increase in basal BDNF concentration. Two out of six studies (i.e. 33%) reported a significantly higher BDNF response to acute exercise following an aerobic or strength training programme (i.e. compared with the BDNF response to an acute exercise at baseline). A few studies of low quality (i.e. retrospective observational studies) show that untrained or moderately trained healthy subjects have higher basal BDNF concentrations than highly trained subjects. Yet, strong evidence still has to come from good methodological studies. Available results suggest that acute aerobic, but not strength exercise increases basal peripheral BDNF concentrations, although the effect is transient. From a few studies we learn that circulating BDNF originates both from central and peripheral sources. We can only speculate which central regions and peripheral sources in particular circulating BDNF originates from, where it is transported to and to what purpose it is used and/or stored at its final destination. No study could show a long-lasting BDNF response to acute exercise or training (i.e. permanently increased basal peripheral BDNF concentration) in healthy subjects or persons with a chronic disease or disability. It seems that exercise and/or training temporarily elevate basal BDNF and possibly upregulate cellular processing of BDNF (i.e. synthesis, release, absorption and degradation). From that point of view, exercise and/or training would result in a higher BDNF synthesis following an acute exercise bout (i.e. compared with untrained subjects). Subsequently, more BDNF could be released into the blood circulation which may, in turn, be absorbed more efficiently by central and/or peripheral tissues where it could induce a cascade of neurotrophic and neuroprotective effects.

This could influence the effect of a GXT on peripheral BDNF levels. The\npreceding exercise of low to moderate intensity, together with the GXT, has also been evaluated as a prolonged\nacute exercise protocol of high intensity and will be discussed in section 2.6.1. In the study of Laske et al.,[ 59 ] BDNF concentration in healthy control subjects did not increase following an\nacute exercise of high intensity. In the study of Gustafsson et al.,[ 58 ] a significant increase in [BDNF] p following an acute exercise of high\nintensity was only found in male control subjects. In the study of Gustafsson et al.,[ 58 ] a significant increase in [BDNF] p following an acute exercise of low to\nmoderate intensity was only found in male persons with MDD. Seifert et al.[ 68 ] found an increase in [BDNF]p measured in the vena jugularis but not in arterial [BDNF] p following an aerobic training programme. Baker et al.[ 50 ] only found an increase in men with mild cognitive impairment. References Hennigan A, O’Callaghan RM, Kelly AM.

This review unifies the knowledge gained across various neuroscience techniques to provide a comprehensive profile of the neural mechanisms that mediate exercise-induced neuroplasticity. Using a model of exercise-induced neuroplasticity, this review emphasizes the sequence of neural events that accompany exercise, and ultimately promote changes in human performance. This is achieved by differentiating between neuroplasticity induced by acute versus chronic aerobic exercise. Furthermore, this review emphasizes experimental considerations that influence the opportunity to observe exercise-induced neuroplasticity in humans. These include modifiable factors associated with the exercise intervention and nonmodifiable factors such as biological sex, ovarian hormones, genetic variations, and fitness level. To maximize the beneficial effects of exercise in health, disease, and following injury, future research should continue to explore the mechanisms that mediate exercise-induced neuroplasticity. This review identifies some fundamental gaps in knowledge that may serve to guide future research in this area. Get full access to this article View all access and purchase options for this article.

The aim of this meta-review was to establish the benefits, safety and adherence of HIIT interventions across all populations from systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Major databases were searched for systematic reviews (with/without meta-analyses) of randomised & non-randomised trials that compared HIIT to a control. Thirty-three systematic reviews (including 25 meta-analyses) were retrieved encompassing healthy subjects and people with physical health complications. Evidence suggested HIIT improved cardiorespiratory fitness, anthropometric measures, blood glucose and glycaemic control, arterial compliance and vascular function, cardiac function, heart rate, some inflammatory markers, exercise capacity and muscle mass, versus non-active controls. Compared to active controls, HIIT improved cardiorespiratory fitness, some inflammatory markers and muscle structure. Improvements in anxiety and depression were seen compared to pre-training. Additionally, no acute injuries were reported, and mean adherence rates surpassed 80% in most systematic reviews. Thus, HIIT is associated with multiple benefits. Further large-scale high-quality studies are needed to reaffirm and expand these findings.

Women who suffer an acute coronary event are more likely to be less physically active than men. 1 Participation in exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (CR) has been shown to improve exercise capacity, enhance quality of life and reduce cardiovascular mortality. 2 Although women are in need of the secondary prevention advantages provided by CR, they are, ironically, less likely than men to adhere to CR. 3 Traditional CR may not meet the needs of women; innovative programmes which target women’s motivation and interests are in dire need. 4 Women-only CR is becoming more common, but developing new, women-only programmes can be challenging and costly particularly when adherence rates are low. 5 Introducing different exercise modalities in existing CR programmes may be a more feasible option for programme directors and benefit the women they serve. Aerobic interval training (AIT) has been shown to produce similar or greater improvements in physical and psychosocial health outcomes in a time-efficient manner when compared to traditional moderate-to-vigorous intensity continuous exercise (MICE) in patients with CVD. 6 Such studies have, however, predominantly involved men, and rarely addressed mental health. 6 The purpose of this matched case–control study was to examine the impact of AIT when compared to MICE on mental and physical health outcomes in women with CVD participating in CR, with the hypothesis that AIT would produce similar or greater improvements in mental and physical health outcomes when compared to MICE. Women who engaged in MICE served as the controls; they were matched for age (±2 years, on average) and cardiovascular diagnosis. Approval for the study was obtained from the Ottawa Health Sciences Network Research Ethics Board (protocol no. 20170721-01H). All exercise training sessions were performed in our prevention and rehabilitation centre. AIT participants exercised twice weekly for 10 weeks. The initial 2 weeks of the 10-week programme served as a familiarisation period during which participants learned a dance-based routine for the AIT protocol. Each session was 45 minutes in duration and followed a modified Norwegian AIT protocol which consisted of: (a) 10-minute warm-up at 60–70% peak heart rate (HR); (b) 4\u2009×\u20094 minutes of high-intensity intervals at 85–95% peak HR interspersed with 3 minutes of low-intensity intervals at 60–70% peak HR; and (c) 10-minute cool-down at 60–70% peak HR. MICE participants exercised twice weekly for 8 weeks. Each session was 60 minutes in duration and followed CR guidelines which consisted of: (a) 10-minute warm-up; (b) 35 minutes of aerobic conditioning at 70–85% peak HR (i.e. moderate-to-vigorous intensity); and (c) 15-minute cool-down. 7 Peak HRs were estimated using the formula: 220 – age (–30 bpm for those taking β-blockers). 8 Depression and anxiety were assessed using the hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS), and body mass, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, resting blood pressure and HR were measured using standardised procedures at the beginning and end of CR. Descriptive data for the 60 participants (AIT n =\u200930; MICE n =\u200930) are shown in Table 1 . We observed improvements over time in anxiety (AIT −1.8\u2009±\u20093.5; MICE −1.5\u2009±\u20093.0 points, P <\u20090.001, ƞ 2 =\u20090.198) and depression (AIT −0.7\u2009±\u20093.0; MICE −1.1\u2009±\u20092.3 points, P =\u20090.003, ƞ 2 =\u20090.151) in women participating in AIT and MICE. We also observed improvements over time in BMI (AIT −0.4\u2009±\u20091.2; MICE −0.2\u2009±\u20090.7\u2009kg/m 2 , P =\u20090.021, ƞ 2 =\u20090.090), waist circumference (AIT −4.4\u2009±\u20097.4; MICE −2.3\u2009±\u20094.7\u2009cm, P <\u20090.001, ƞ 2 =\u20090.231) and resting diastolic blood pressure (AIT −1.0\u2009±\u20097.9; MICE −4.7\u2009±\u20099.0\u2009mmHg, P =\u20090.035, ƞ 2 =\u20090.090) in women participating in AIT and MICE. No significant differences in the number of exercise sessions attended were found between the AIT (91%) and MICE (96%) groups ( P =\u20090.243). Table 1.

The present study employed a mixed research method. An experimental study was conducted to analyze the current status of the volunteers’ sports performance and body composition, and then a questionnaire was designed for the subjects’ physical and mental health. The data were then analyzed using SPSS 26.0 software for statistical analysis such as t -test and ANOVA. The subjects were then interviewed to collect their opinions on the study results, and finally, the results were explored by multivariate analysis. The study found that intermittent exercise can help university students develop physical fitness and performance, improve body composition, and regulate physical and mental health. The combination of intermittent exercise with sports massages further enhanced the performance of sit-ups and standing long jump, improve blood pressure, BMI, and self-confidence, as well as reducing suicidal tendencies (experimental group > control group). However, intermittent exercise participants still experienced fatigue, headache, emotional loss, and fear of depression, and the addition of sports massage did not significantly improve flexibility and cardiorespiratory endurance (control group > experimental group).

Introduction Human resources are one of the main driving forces of a country’s economic development, and the young population is the cornerstone and hope for the country’s future development. With the advancement of technology, economic development, and medical quality, the average life expectancy of Chinese people has improved dramatically [ 1 ], providing stable human resources for national development. Due to the booming business and trade, the economic level has risen, the quality of life and the consumption ability have increased, the nutritional intake is convenient and diversified. However, due to the fast pace of life and the pressure of work, the obese population is increasing year by year, the number of patients with hypertension and cardiovascular diseases remains high [ 2 ], the age of patients is decreasing year by year [ 3 , 4 ], and the risk for young people is increasing [ 5 ], which depletes medical resources and affects public health and national development [ 6 ]. According to previous data, more than 70% of adolescents worldwide face the problem of low activity level and lack physical adaptability [ 7 ]. In addition, the increased environmental risk in the community due to the COVID-19 epidemic from 2019 onwards has decreased the willingness of adolescents and children to get out and exercise [ 8 ]. Physiologically, changes in lifestyle behaviors, increased sedentary or lying-down time [ 9 ], or reduced willingness to engage in exercise can lead to increased body weight, decreased cardiopulmonary and physical adaptability [ 10 ], as well as physiological symptoms such as disorders of muscles, bones, and perceptual nerves, and gastrointestinal discomfort [ 11 , 12 ]. Psychologically, the lack of social and interpersonal interaction and communication can easily lead to emotional instability, anxiety, panic, and increased psychological stress [ 10 , 13 ], resulting in adaptive disorders that may induce cardiovascular disease [ 14 ] and permanent vascular tension disorder under long-term deterioration [ 11 ]. It is evident that, in addition to the current health problems arising from low activity levels and inadequate physical adaptability [ 7 , 15 ], living under the COVID-19 environmental risk and response protocols poses a deeper negative impact on the well-being and growth of adolescents [ 8 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 ]. Studies have confirmed that the COVID-19 environment has significant effects on the mental or physical health of adolescents [ 8 ] which has become a major concern for governments [ 6 , 19 , 20 ]. It has also been shown that physical exercise can help improve physical and mental health [ 21 , 22 ], regulate psychological stress [ 23 , 24 ], and improve life and academic performance [ 25 ]. However, in fact, university students’ willingness to exercise is still decreasing due to requirement differences in the exercise environment, equipment and methods, convenience of exercise participation process [ 26 ], perception differences in the goal of physical appearance improvement, and comfort of exercise experience, as well as time and cost factors [ 27 ]. Therefore, making exercise decisions that require less time and cost and have significant exercise outcomes can reduce barriers to exercise participation, meet the objectives of adolescents’ exercise needs, and help improve their current physical and mental health problems [ 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 ]. Based on the intensity design, intermittent exercise can be divided into two modes: HICT and MICT. It is a break from the conventional method of long-duration low-intensity aerobic exercise for fat loss [ 28 ]. Both exercise intensities are gradually adopted by the public because they both improve cardiorespiratory fitness with short time requirements and high efficiency [ 29 ]. Although studies have shown that HICT exercise mode is more effective in improving well-being and physical fitness [ 30 ], long-term use of HICT training is associated with periodic fatigue [ 16 ]. Therefore, to promote the use of intermittent exercise to improve the physical and mental health of university students, periodic fatigue [ 16 ] will be an influential factor in the willingness of university students to exercise. Exercise can improve well-being [ 22 ], but exercise fatigue can also cause negative effects on physical and mental health [ 28 , 29 , 30 ]. Soreness or fatigue after exercise will affect sleep quality and daily life [ 31 ] and affect participants’ willingness to exercise or performance [ 32 ]. Therefore, if intermittent exercise is recommended to improve physical fitness for health, finding ways to resolve or relieve fatigue and restore exercise performance [ 31 , 33 , 34 , 35 ] will be instrumental to the willingness of university students to engage in intermittent exercise. Massage is one of the age-old tools of medical care in China [ 36 , 37 ]. Through massage techniques, it helps to relieve muscle tension, cardiovascular and visual disorders, and improve health [ 38 ], which has been validated in relevant studies [ 39 ]. Massage techniques should have the same effect in relieving fatigue produced by intermittent exercise. Therefore, the investigators believed that the combination of sports massage techniques would improve the fatigue in university students adopting intermittent exercise mode, which would help to further increase their willingness to engage in intermittent exercise. Studies have shown that exercise can help improve health [ 22 ] and massage can relieve fatigue [ 38 , 39 ]. However, most of the current studies on intermittent exercise have focused on human health [ 38 ], analyzed exercise patterns [ 29 ], and investigated their effects on improving exercise performance [ 38 ] and fat loss [ 28 ]. Massage studies, on the other hand, focus on the treatment of cervical nerve [ 36 ] and lower back pain [ 39 ] as well as the relief of muscle soreness [ 40 , 41 ]. In the context of the current COVID-19 epidemic, only a few studies have examined the effects of massage and intermittent exercise on adolescents’ exercise behavior [ 42 ], daily activity and respiratory status [ 43 , 44 ], and physical and mental health [ 45 , 46 ]. Besides, there has been no study combining the themes of massage and intermittent exercise. Therefore, we believed that it would be helpful to fill the gap in the current research by examining the effects of massage on athletic performance, body composition, and perception of physical and mental health of exercise participants, based on the example of university students, and provide guidance for governments, educational institutions, teachers, and individual students. 2. Literature Review 2.1. Seven-Minute High-Intensity Circuit Training (HICT) Intermittent exercise is a break from the norm to perform long periods of low-intensity aerobic exercise for fat loss [ 28 ]. According to the difference in exercise intensity, intermittent exercise can be subdivided into HICT and MICT, both of which have an improvement effect on the cardiorespiratory fitness of healthy adults. HICT is more effective, but both have the characteristics of short duration and high efficiency, which are gradually being adopted by the public [ 29 ]. The 7-min high-intensity circuit training (7 min HICT) exercise mode emphasizes that participants can exercise in a safe environment, without special exercise equipment, in any environment, and with high exercise effectiveness. Exercise mode adopts 30 s of exercise, 10 s of rest exercise cycle, performing jumping jacks, wall sits, push-ups, abdominal crunch, step-up onto a chair, squat, triceps dip on a chair, plank, high knees, lunge, push-up, and rotation, swap left and right—side plank, and 12 other dynamic and static exercise programs [ 47 ], which can achieve aerobic exercise effects to increase muscle endurance at the same time [ 48 ]. 2.2. Massage Massage, also known as tui na, is one of the oldest medical treatments in China [ 36 ]. It is a medical and health care method that uses the part of the hands for manipulation and was gradually developed by the ancient Chinese people after summarizing their knowledge and skills from long experiences of labor and disease care [ 37 ]. Massage can be divided into medical massage, health massage, and sports massage in terms of techniques, contents, and application objects [ 36 , 37 ]. According to research, massage has been shown to be useful in reducing cardiovascular and visual diseases and improving overall health quality [ 41 ]. Massage techniques are diverse and mainly aim at relieving fatigue and tension in patients [ 47 ]. Massage techniques and skills are diverse but are derived in similar ways from various branches. Common massage techniques include pushing, rubbing, kneading, kneading and pinching, pressing, scrubbing, tapping, shaking, pulling, and acupressure. They all aim to achieve the goal of patient comfort and effectiveness [ 49 ], and in fact, the effects are similar and do not differ much. 2.3. Seven-Minute High-Intensity Circuit Training (HICT) and Massage HICT has positive effects on improving physical and mental health as well as physical fitness [ 27 ], achieving great results in a short time span. Therefore, the investigators believed that, under the pressure of the current epidemic environment, high-intensity intermittent exercise could resolve the barriers to exercise caused by time and space constraints and increase university students’ willingness to exercise. Although exercise helps to improve health [ 22 ], long-term training produces periodic fatigue [ 12 , 44 , 45 ] and results in tiredness and muscle discomfort [ 16 , 29 , 30 ], which in turn affects the willingness to exercise. Studies have confirmed that massage helps to reduce exercise fatigue [ 36 , 37 , 38 , 39 ], prolong the ability to exercise, and preserve health. Therefore, it was hypothesized that massage should have the same fatigue-reducing effect on participants of intermittent exercise. However, since there have been no relevant research results, the investigators sought to investigate whether massage would have the same effect on the exercise performance and body composition of intermittent exercise participants. 2.4. Physical Fitness (Exercise Performance) Healthy physical fitness is composed of four different physical abilities, including cardiorespiratory fitness, muscular fitness, flexibility, and body composition [ 50 ]. Physical fitness can be assessed in terms of cardiorespiratory fitness, muscular fitness, flexibility, and body composition [ 47 ]. Cardiopulmonary fitness is measured in seconds and is usually performed by running and walking. The smaller the number, the better the cardiorespiratory fitness [ 51 ]. It is used to understand the function of gas exchange in the lungs and the rate at which the heart transports blood and oxygen and other nutrients to the whole body to provide energy for overall physical activity [ 23 ]. The muscle fitness test is evaluated by one-minute bent knee sit-ups and standing long jump and measured in terms of the number of reps and centimeters, the larger the number, the better the muscle fitness [ 51 ]. It is used to understand the strength of the abdominal and lower limb muscle groups of the individual. Flexibility is determined by measuring how far the body is bent forward in a seated position, measured in centimeters, and the longer the measurement distance, the better the result. Body composition is represented by the body mass index (BMI), and the standard value falls between 18 and 25 (standards vary for men and women). The measurement formula is: BMI = weight (kg)/height (m 2 ) Therefore, to understand the effects of intermittent exercise on physical fitness and athletic performance of university students, corresponding test indicators and methods are needed. The physical fitness and exercise performance will be measured by 800/1500 running and walking, one-minute bent knee sit-ups, standing long jump, and seated forward bend, and the physiological health indicators will be assessed by body weight, height, blood pressure, and BMI. 2.5. Physical and Mental Health Awareness As stated by WHO in 1948, physical and mental health refers to a state of physical, mental, and social well-being [ 52 ]. This includes the physical, psychological and social aspects of an individual’s body composition, mental health, and social adjustment [ 53 ]. Physical and mental health is an analytical method of self-perception assessment [ 54 , 55 ], and public health issues, moreover, require scientific evidence to present the actual results [ 56 ]. Investigating individual physical and mental health phenomena based on personal perceptions can reveal the impact of the current environment on people [ 20 ]. Physical and mental health can be viewed in terms of psychological, spiritual, and attitudinal components [ 20 , 57 , 58 ], as evidenced by anxiety, competence, enthusiasm, headache, abdominal pain, insomnia, stomach pain, irregular diet, and suicidal ideation [ 59 , 60 ]. Therefore, the researchers sought to understand whether the physical and mental health of university students who used massage to relieve muscle and psychological stress after intermittent exercise were relieved. The study of the psychological, mental, and attitudinal aspects of the subjects would provide accurate information. As shown in Figure 1 . Figure 1. The research structure. 3. Methods and Instruments 3.1. Study Framework, Design, Positioning, and Hypotheses Exercise is beneficial for physical and mental health [ 22 ]. 7-min high-intensity circuit training can be used in a safe environment, without special exercise equipment, in any setting to obtain high exercise effectiveness [ 47 ]. Although intermittent exercise will produce sports fatigue, massage helps to recover from fatigue, effectively activates blood circulation, and improves body quality [ 41 , 61 ]. This exercise theory and model may be effective in improving the physical and mental health of university students. Therefore, based on the above theory, a mixed research method [ 62 , 63 , 64 , 65 , 66 , 67 ] was used to obtain 20 volunteers and divide them into an experimental and a control group. During the experimental period, both groups were tested to perform a 7-min intermittent exercise experiment, and their physical fitness performance, body composition, and body composition were monitored. The questionnaires were compiled with reference to the literature [ 24 , 25 , 26 , 27 , 28 , 29 , 30 , 31 , 32 , 33 , 34 , 35 , 36 , 37 , 38 , 39 , 40 , 41 , 42 , 43 , 44 , 45 , 46 , 47 , 48 , 49 , 50 , 51 , 52 , 53 , 54 , 55 , 56 , 57 , 58 , 59 , 60 ], and the subjects’ physical and mental health cognitions were continuously collected and validated by statistical validation using SPSS 26.0 statistical software. Lastly, all the information was gathered and integrated by a rigorous sequence of consolidation, organization, and analysis so as to finally construct the article [ 68 ] and analyze the results with multivariate verification [ 69 , 70 ]. Based on the above description, there are three research hypotheses: Hypothesis 1 ( H1 ) . It is hypothesized that massage would result in a significant improvement in the physical fitness performance of intermittent exercise participants. Hypothesis 2 ( H2 ) . It is hypothesized that massage would result in a significant improvement in the body composition of intermittent exercise participants. Hypothesis 3 ( H3 ) . It is hypothesized that there would be significant improvements in physical and mental health for participants with or without sports massage combined with intermittent exercise. 3.2. Study Procedure and Tools The study was conducted to verify the effects of massage on the physical fitness performance, body composition, and physical and mental health of intermittent exercise participants. Two types of research designs were used: An ambient exercise experiment and a questionnaire survey. The research process and tools are described below. 3.2.1. Experimental Design of Physical Fitness Testing Due to the regulation and requirement of exercise planning and the fact that the exercise performance could not reach the intermittent exercise performance, the final number of subjects in the physical fitness test experiment was 20. In addition to the subjects’ daily routine, the experimental group adopted a 7-min high-intensity intermittent exercise design and performed a sports massage after the exercise; the control group did not receive a sports massage, and the two groups conducted the experiment for 7 weeks. Tested on the day before and after the intermittent exercise training for 7 weeks. The experiment was conducted using a digital watch (timing), a multifunctional smartphone (video playback, recording, and audio recording), a leather ruler (measuring height and flexibility), an oximeter, and a bodyweight meter to measure the basic values of height, weight, blood pressure, blood oxygen concentration, and trimesters, and to record the 800/1500 m running time. In the study design, the physical fitness and body composition data were measured before and after the experiment on the first and last day, and the participants’ body composition values such as height, weight, blood pressure (pulse), blood oxygen concentration, and trimesters were measured. The participants were also tested in 800/1500 m running and walking, standing long jump, seated forward bend, and knee-bending sit-ups. On the first day, after obtaining data on physical fitness and body composition, the experiment was explained and massage knowledge and skills were reinforced. On the second day, according to the experimental program of 5 consecutive days per week for 7 weeks, body composition and blood pressure (pulse) data were obtained before each operation, and a 7-min intermittent exercise course was conducted afterward. A total of 12 exercise movements were performed, with 30 s of operation and 10 s of rest for each movement. After the exercise training was completed, the exercise massage was immediately carried out for 5–10 min before the exercise experiment program was completed. 3.2.2. The Compiling and Analysis of Mental Health Questionnaire The physical and mental health scale was developed with reference to relevant literature [ 23 , 24 , 25 , 26 , 27 , 28 , 29 , 30 , 31 , 32 , 33 , 34 , 35 , 36 , 37 , 38 , 39 , 40 , 41 , 42 , 43 , 44 , 45 , 46 , 47 , 48 , 49 , 50 , 51 , 52 , 53 , 54 , 55 , 56 , 57 , 58 , 59 , 60 ], and then three coaches with national sports team coaching experience and academics in the fields of exercise physiology and psychology were invited to review the contents of the questionnaire. Ten questionnaires were distributed initially, and the reliability and validity of the questionnaires were examined using SPSS 26.0 statistical software, and a high-reliability question with a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.7 or higher was used for follow-up analysis [ 71 ]. However, due to the environmental safety considerations of the COVID-19 epidemic and the specific exercise program and target population, the questionnaires were distributed and collected using the Chinese Wenjuanxing online questionnaire platform. Intentional sampling was used and the participants of this experiment were defined as the subjects. A total of 120 subjects were originally included in the survey, but due to elimination and withdrawal during the participation period, a total of 66 questionnaires were obtained including the participants. Basic statistics were used to examine the post-experimental self-awareness questionnaires of the participants. VOOV video conferencing software was used to interview the participants, experts, and scholars, and opinions were presented based on the statistical test results. Finally, the multivariate verification analysis method was used to integrate the information from different research subjects [ 69 , 70 ] by various research theories and methods, and accurate knowledge and meanings were obtained by comparing the research results from multiple perspectives and data [ 68 ]. Self-perception assessment of physical and mental health [ 54 , 55 ] examines psychological, spiritual, and attitudinal components [ 57 , 58 ] in terms of anxiety, competence, enthusiasm, headache, abdominal pain, insomnia, stomach pain, eating irregularities, and suicidal intention [ 59 , 60 , 62 ]. There were 13 questions on physical and mental health, and the results of statistical analysis showed that the KMO value was 0.671, while Bartlett’s approximate χ 2 value was 185.86 and df was 78, with a significance of p < 0.001, which was suitable for factor analysis. The explained variances of the scales were 34.95%, 25.13%, and 13.88%, and the total explained variance was 73.97%. After factor analysis, all of them were retained. The alpha coefficients of the three scales were 0.917, 0.909, and 0.905, and the alpha coefficient of the total scale was 0.920. Based on the above analysis results, it is clear that this questionnaire has good reliability. As shown in Table 1 . Table 1. Analysis of questionnaire tools. 3.3. Study Scope and Limitations A mixed-method study was conducted to verify the effects of massage on physical fitness performance, body composition, as well as physical and mental health of intermittent exercisers using experimental, quantitative, and qualitative studies. The subjects of the study were students aged about 20 years old from a university in Fujian, China. Due to safety considerations such as schooling, daily life, personal physical health, and athletic performance ability, as well as factors such as funding, time, and manpower, it was not possible to provide a sample size for validation and analysis, so it was not possible to extend the validation to other countries, ages, or occupational backgrounds. The above limitations will be listed as suggestions for follow-up research, awaiting further studies by other researchers for improvement. 3.4. Ethical Considerations The data for this study were collected by a combination of intentional sampling and snowball sampling, and the participants were all students enrolled in the course. Therefore, all respondents approved and understood the purpose of the study and agreed to cooperate in providing relevant data. All questionnaires and interviews were recorded and data were collected anonymously and knowingly. 4. Analysis of Results It is known in the literature that exercise improves physical and mental health [ 22 ], although intermittent exercise tends to produce fatigue, which affects exercise performance and willingness to participate [ 35 ]. Massage can help to relieve fatigue [ 37 ], stabilize cardiovascular disease [ 41 ], and restore physical and mental health [ 38 ]. According to the study design, the physical fitness performance, body composition, and physical and mental health awareness of the subjects were analyzed. The study consisted of two parts: an experimental study and a questionnaire survey. All subjects were recruited as volunteers who were clear about the purpose of the experiment during the study. Under the condition that their living and learning needs were not affected, the subjects agreed to cooperate with the research project process and were willing to provide sample data during the experiment in an anonymous and non-public manner, thus the experimental data were considered highly valid. However, the experimental data may still be affected due to the experimental targets and the consideration of subjects’ health and safety. We, therefore, recruited students aged about 20 years old from a university in Fujian, China as the target population. Sixty-six participants, 30 males and 36 females, were enrolled in the questionnaire survey. The experimental study was conducted with 20 valid samples (7 males and 13 females), and the experimental group (with massage, 5 males and 5 females) and the control group (without massage, 2 males and 8 females) were assigned by intentional sampling. 4.1. Analysis of Physical Fitness Differences The data of the experimental subjects were obtained from the experimental group (Tester) of 10 individuals, numbered T1–T10, and the control group (Controller) of 10 individuals, numbered C1–10. According to the physical fitness test standard [ 72 ], the performance of sit-ups, seated forward bends, standing long jump, and cardiorespiratory endurance were analyzed, and the assessment levels included gold, silver, bronze, medium, and to be enhanced. The standard values for male and female testing in the assessment were: The standard number of sit-ups within 60 s was gold (>44:>35), silver (42–43:33–34), bronze (38–41:28–32), medium (33–37:24–28), and to be enhanced (26–32:18–23). The standard times of seated forward bend within 60 s are: gold (>41:>44), silver (38–40:41–43), bronze (32–37:35–40), medium (26–31:29–34), and to be strengthened (17–25:20–27). The distance of the long jump was measured in centimeters during the two jump tests, and the longest distance was measured, gold (>235:>182), silver (245–249:175–178), bronze (229–241:162–172), intermediate (214–226:149–159), and to be strengthened (191–210:130–146). Cardiorespiratory endurance was measured in seconds for single exercise performance in running (male: female), gold medal (<7′10:<4′10), silver medal (7′37–7′25:4′24–4′18), bronze (8′28–7′49:4′49–4′30), medium (9′18–8′37:5′10–4′54), and to be enhanced (10′30–9′31:5′52–5′21). The analysis revealed that the subjects’ physical fitness changed after the experiment. The improvement in sit-ups ranged from a low of 1 to a high of 34, with women (+34) showing a greater improvement than men (+10). The improvement in seated forward bend ranged from a minimum of 0 cm to a maximum of 20 cm, with females (+20) improving more than males (+5). All subjects improved in the standing long jump, except for one female (−3) whose performance decreased, with a minimum improvement of 3 cm and a maximum improvement of 48 cm, and males improved more than females. All subjects improved in cardiorespiratory endurance, with a minimum improvement of 5 s and a maximum improvement of 1 min and 43 s (103 s), and the performance of females (1 min and 43 s) was more obvious than that of males (60 s). As shown in Table 2 . Table 2. Statistical difference analysis of physical fitness of the experimental group before and after the experiment. Before the experiment, all subjects in the control group performed 23–43 sit-ups, 0–60 cm seated forward bend, 138–220 cm standing long jump, 7′43 for men (1500 m), and 5′40 for women (800 m). After the experiment, all subjects in the control group showed growth in sit-ups, with a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 8, with females (+8) showing greater growth than males (+2). In the Seated forward bend event, all subjects showed growth, with a minimum of 1 cm and a maximum of 22 cm, and greater growth for females (+22) than males (+2). In the standing long jump event, except for two female (−5) subjects who decreased, all the subjects grew, with minimum growth of 5 cm and maximum growth of 13 cm, and the growth of male (+13) was higher than that of female (+10). In the cardiorespiratory endurance category, all subjects showed an increase in speed, with a minimum increase of 24 s and a maximum increase of 1 min and 10 s (70 s), and the improvement was more pronounced. As shown in Table 3 . Table 3. Statistical difference analysis of physical fitness of the control group before and after the experiment. Based on the above results, the experimental group was compared with the control group in sit-ups, seated forward bends, standing long jump, and cardiorespiratory endurance. It was found that the experimental group had better results than the control group in all items except for the seated forward bend (20:22). In both male and female subjects, the control group improved more than the experimental group in seated forward bend and cardiorespiratory endurance, while the experimental group outperformed the control group in sit-ups and cardiorespiratory endurance. This result indicates that Hypothesis 1 holds. As shown in Table 4 . Table 4. Comparative analysis of exercise performance data between experimental group and control group. Inspector: “When you are engaged in the seven-minute intermittent exercise, how does massage change the test results of your front and back exercise adaptability?” T1: “Although intermittent exercise is intensive and frequent, it feels very effective …, massage can make me feel less fatigued during exercise.” C1: “I feel tired easily during exercise, especially my thighs.” T2: “Exercising makes me feel stronger and stronger in my thighs …; I will not affect my sports performance due to fatigue.” C6: “In the initial stage, when the test was to be carried out, I always felt that I could not complete the test …, but after exercising, I did not expect to be able to complete the test. This means that whenever I feel fatigued after exercising, I will not be able to complete the test tomorrow. Will not be able to boost motivation.” 4.2. Analysis of Body Composition Differences According to the test standard [ 73 ], BMI was calculated by weight and height data of individuals, and converted by the formula, and divided into underweight (18.5–), healthy (18.5–24), overweight (24–27), mild obesity (27–30), moderate obesity (30–35), and obesity (35+). The blood pressure was measured in mmHg, and the diastolic blood pressure was divided into normal (<120), initial (120–139), phase I (140–159), and phase II (>160), and the systolic blood pressure was divided into normal (<80), initial (80–89), phase I (90–99), and phase II (>100). The analysis revealed that the experimental group had a height of 153–176 cm, a weight of 50.6–66.5 kg, a diastolic blood pressure of 64–100, a systolic blood pressure of 111–163, and a BMI of 21.4–17.9. After the experiment, the experimental group had no change in height, but had a minimum change of −0.2 and a maximum change of +1.22 in weight, with a greater change in men (−2.3) than in women (−2). The minimum change in BMI was −0.7 and the maximum change was −1.2, with a greater change in males (−1.4) than females (+0.3). In blood pressure, all subjects showed improvement. Diastolic blood pressure improved at a minimum of −4 and a maximum of −25, with a greater change in women (−25) than in men (−19); systolic blood pressure improved at a minimum of 0 and a maximum of −47, with a greater change in men (−47) than in women (−20). As shown in Table 5 . Table 5. Statistical comparison of body quality and physical fitness of subjects in the experimental group before and after the experiment. The analysis revealed that the control group initially had a height of 157–168 cm, a weight of 44.6–60 kg, a diastolic blood pressure of 68–80, a systolic blood pressure of 100–134, and a BMI of 16.5–23.7. After the experiment, there was no change in height in the control group, but the weight change was −2 at the minimum and +1.5 at the maximum, with a greater change in males (−2.3) than in females (−2.0). The change in BMI was 0 at the minimum and −0.7 at the maximum, with a greater change in males (−1.4) than in females (+0.3). Blood pressure improved in all subjects, with diastolic blood pressure improving at a minimum of +2 and a maximum of −1.4, with a greater change in women (+9) than in men (+5); systolic blood pressure improved at a minimum of 0 and a maximum of −19, with a greater change in women (+19) than in men (−3). As shown in Table 6 . Table 6. Statistical comparison of body quality and physical fitness of subjects in the control group before and after the experiment. According to the above results, there was no difference between the experimental group and the control group in terms of height measurements. In terms of body weight, the control group grew more than the experimental group (1.5 > 0.22). In terms of diastolic blood pressure, the experimental group improved more than the control group (−25 > −15) and systolic blood pressure (−47 > −19). The improvement in BMI was greater in the experimental group than in the control group (−1.2 > −0.7), and the improvement was greater in the experimental group than the control group for men and in the control group than the experimental group for women. This result indicates that Hypothesis 2 holds. As shown in Table 7 . Table 7. Comparison of body composition data between experimental and control groups. Inspector: “When you are engaged in the seven-minute intermittent exercise, how does massage change your blood pressure and body composition (height, weight)?” T2: “I feel more massaged, which reduces my fatigue problem, …, sleeps better, and usually feels calmer …” C3: “Although I feel tired easily during exercise, I feel better breathing after exercise and when I get up every morning …; my appetite feels better …” T10: “After more massages, exercise makes me feel better and better. Adding massage after exercise makes me feel better. When I get up the next day, I feel more energetic and emotionally stable …” C1: “As the number of days of exercise increases, the fatigue will become more and more obvious …” C4: “After each exercise, fatigue still exists, and it is becoming more and more obvious …; After a day of study and exercise, after a day of rest, you will feel more energetic.” 4.3. Physical and Mental Health Awareness Analysis Next, the analysis of physical and mental health awareness revealed that all subjects believed that intermittent exercise could increase confidence (4.02), improve sleep (3.45), and increase appetite (2.63), but had little effect on relieving headaches (2.49), emotional disorders (2.77), and fear of depression (2.97). In addition, both the experimental and control groups showed significant ( p > 0.01) differences in back pain and suicidal tendency, and the experimental group was better than the control group. There was no significant difference between the perceptions of men and women in the different experimental groups ( p > 0.05). This result indicates that Hypothesis 3 is not valid. As shown in Table 8 . Table 8. Analysis of physical and mental health awareness of subjects with different experimental contents. Inspector: “When you are engaged in the seven-minute intermittent exercise, how does massage change your physical and mental health before and after?” T2: “I feel more massaged, which reduces my fatigue problem … After exercise, it makes me sleep better and my body feels calmer …; I feel that all the stress is gone.” T4: “After exercising, I feel the pressure disappeared all day; my stomach muscles feel tighter and tighter.” T5: “After each exercise, the waist muscles feel tight.” C3: “Although exercise makes me feel more comfortable, the fatigue after exercise still makes me feel uncomfortable …” T10: “After more massages, exercise makes me feel better and better. Adding massage after exercise makes me feel better. When I wake up the next day, I feel better …” C1: “As the number of days of exercise increases, the feeling of fatigue will become more and more obvious …; The fatigue that cannot be eliminated, coupled with the pressure of study, will make you feel a little tired.” C4: “If I can, I hope that there will be no fatigue after exercise. Soreness will cause problems in my studies.” 4.4. Discuss 4.4.1. Physical Fitness Difference Analysis The main physical fitness tests are sit-ups, seated forward bends, standing long jump, and cardiorespiratory endurance. Sit-ups and cardiorespiratory endurance require a high level of muscular endurance performance. The standing long jump requires sufficient explosive power and body coordination. Seated forward bend requires flexibility of the limbs and comfortable muscle and joint extension to achieve good athletic performance. The experiments confirmed that the intermittent exercise participants who received the massage (experimental group) had better results than the group without the massage (control group) in all physical fitness measures, except for the seated forward bend. We believed that although intermittent exercise features short time requirements and high efficiency [ 29 ], long-term training results in periodic fatigue [ 16 , 47 , 48 ], which can be a nuisance for exercise participants. Massage has a significant effect on relieving fatigue [ 49 ] and improving physical fitness [ 41 ]. For the experimental group, although fatigue might occur, the massage technique could be used to accelerate the metabolism of lactic acid, eliminate fatigue, and restore muscle comfort. While the training objectives of the exercise program in this study were mainly about muscular fitness and cardiorespiratory endurance training and not about physical extension activities, the participants still benefited from massage techniques that restore their muscle flexibility and eliminate fatigue. Therefore, in addition to strengthening the existing exercise objectives, enhancing the endurance and function of muscles and the cardiorespiratory system can also slightly improve muscular extensibility. Consequently, the experimental group had better results than the control group in all tests except for the seated forward bend. In both male and female subjects, the control group improved more than the experimental group in the seated forward bend and cardiorespiratory endurance tests, while the experimental group outperformed the control group in sit-ups and cardiorespiratory endurance. 4.4.2. Body Composition Difference Analysis The results showed that although the bodyweight of the experimental group increased, the improvement in blood pressure (diastolic and systolic) and BMI was greater than that of the control group. We believed that massage helps to deter cardiovascular disease [ 41 ] and intermittent exercise helps to improve physiological status [ 33 ]. The integration of exercise planning and massage can help to obtain better exercise results. In this study, the main objective of the training was to improve cardiopulmonary fitness and muscular endurance. Good cardiopulmonary fitness helps to increase oxygen intake and improve blood circulation while relieving psychological stress, which can improve physical fitness to a certain extent. However, most of the subjects had already passed the growth period, and the experiment was only conducted for a short time span. If we want to extend the investigation of the effect of intermittent exercise on growth, it will be necessary to extend the experiment period or find other subjects for the experiment. In addition, in the early stage of the experiment, the BMI of the participants were generally between 16.5–23.7 which indicated a healthy or thin state (healthy: 18.5–24). Because exercise stimulates blood circulation and accelerates metabolism, the body needs to generate a considerable amount of energy to cope with the high-intensity exercise. In order to obtain sufficient energy, the participants thus increased their nutritional intake, which in turn changed their health status. However, excessive dietary intake may lead to nutrient accumulation and fatigue from exercise, which may affect exercise performance and willingness to burn calories, resulting in insufficient exercise performance. Therefore, the results of the study showed that there was no difference in the height measurement for all subjects. For blood pressure and BMI, the experimental group improved better than the control group, and the control group gained more weight than the experimental group. 4.4.3. Physical and Mental Health Awareness Difference Analysis The results showed that all intermittent exercise participants significantly felt a boost in confidence, improved sleep, and increased appetite, but there was no improvement in headache, loss of emotional control, or fear of depression. The data indicated that the control group experienced more pronounced back pain and suicidal tendencies, and there was no difference in the feelings of the different genders in each group. We believed that due to the improved life quality and excessive nutritional intake [ 2 ], coupled with environmental risks in the community [ 8 ] that change the lifestyle and willingness to exercise, youths are at risk for physical and mental health problems [ 9 ]. Exercise is beneficial to physical and mental health [ 22 ]. High-intensity intermittent exercise can further increase metabolism, relieve stress, and effectively improve physical and mental health. Due to its short duration and fast exercise effect, high-intensity intermittent exercise has become an ideal option for young people to improve their physical and mental health. In addition, massage can eliminate the fatigue generated after exercise, promote blood circulation, accelerate metabolism, improve muscle tension, and relieve stress. However, because of the busy schedule of university students and the heavy load of homework, coupled with the high intensity of intermittent exercise, those who are not participants in long-term sports or have no exercise planning may not be able to relieve the pressure of engaging in exercise and still feel nervous, fear, and even have headache problems. Therefore, all subjects thought that intermittent exercise could increase confidence, improve sleep, and increase appetite, but it was not very effective in relieving the feelings of headache, loss of emotional control, and fear of depression. Although intermittent exercise is highly intense and demanding, massage can be performed after exercise to relieve muscle pain. The exercise carried out in this study mostly aimed to improve cardiorespiratory endurance, which can effectively promote blood circulation, enhance concentration and sports performance, and further increase self-confidence. However, because they were mostly endurance training and abdominal muscle exercises, if the massage was not correctly performed or insufficient, it might not be able to relieve the fatigue of deep abdominal muscles, resulting in the problem of back pain. Therefore, although the experimental group was prone to the problem of back pain due to exercise, it was effective in improving self-confidence and reducing suicidal ideation. 5. Conclusions The findings of the study showed that intermittent exercise for university students can help enhance physical fitness and sports performance, improve body composition, and regulate physical and mental health status. If combined with sports massage, physiologically, it can improve the performance of sit-ups, standing long jump, blood pressure, and BMI. Psychologically, it can improve self-confidence and reduce the negative thoughts of seeking death. However, sports massage has little effect on the negative psychological feelings of headache, emotional loss of control, fear or depression, and physiological phenomena such as flexibility and cardiorespiratory endurance of participants of intermittent exercise. Based on the findings of the study, the following recommendations are made: 1. Establishing intermittent exercise programs for university students to improve their physical and mental health. According to the results of the experiment, intermittent exercise is beneficial to improve physical and mental health, and schools should be encouraged to introduce relevant exercise courses to help university students establish good exercise habits in the face of a reduced social and sports environment. 2. Adjusting intermittent exercise content to meet different needs. Intermittent exercises have certain restrictions and intensities, which cannot be easily adapted due to the physical and mental health of college students. Therefore, it is recommended that participants should adjust the intensity of exercises on their own based on their health conditions, or design exercise programs that train different body components, muscles, or tissues to provide participants with choices. 3. Continuing exploration in light of the study limitations and findings. The study found that massage significantly affected the performance of intermittent exercise participants. However, due to the limitations of the study, the changes in performance during exercise were not explored in depth. In addition, this study only recruited Chinese university students as the experimental subjects, so the findings may not be applicable to other countries or age groups of exercise participants. Therefore, it is recommended that subsequent researchers extend the study to examine changes in exercise performance or explore other regions and subjects to help fill in the research gaps.

Abstract There is a growing body of literature that recognizes the positive effects of exercise on mood states such as anxiety, stress and depression, through physiological and biochemical mechanisms, including endorphins, mitochondria, mammalian target of rapamycin, neurotransmitters and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, and via the thermogenic hypothesis. In addition, psychological mechanisms influence the effects of exercise on mood states, as suggested by both the distraction hypothesis and the self-efficacy hypothesis. Exercise has also been shown to reduce inflammation via several different processes (inflammation, cytokines, toll-like receptors, adipose tissue and via the vagal tone), which can contribute to better health outcomes in people suffering from mood disorders. Introduction There are many studies advocating the positive effects of exercise on mental health [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8]. The general outcome from research indicates that exercise can bring about many physiological changes which result in an improvement in mood state, self-esteem and lower stress and anxiety levels. The physical effects of exercise include reduction of blood pressure, enhanced cardiovascular fitness, weight loss, and prevention of chronic diseases such as cancer, diabetes, hypertension, obesity, osteoporosis and cognitive conditions like Alzheimer’s [9], [10], [11], [12], [13]. As yet, there is no conclusive proof that implicates a single mechanism or group of mechanisms that reliably affect the exercise-mood relationship, nor does it seem that the nature of exercise being either aerobic or anaerobic is a significant factor as both forms of exercise can bring about an improvement in mental health [14], [15], [16]. It appears that the benefits of exercise come about by numerous physiological or psychological changes. Physiological effects of exercise can include an increase in endorphin levels [17], [18], [19], [20], body temperature [21], [22], [23], [24], mitochondrial function and mitochondriogenesis [25], [26], [27], an increase in the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTor) signalling [28], [29], [30], neurotransmitter production [31], [32], [33], [34] and attenuation of the hypothalamic pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis response to stress [15], [27], [31]. Whilst psychological effects may include a distraction from feelings of depression and anxiety [35], [36], [37] and positive feelings associated with mastery and selfefficacy [8], [38], [39], [40]. There is much evidence that inflammation and inflammatory diseases contribute to mood disorders and poor mental health, and it seems that exercise may help to lower inflammation and be beneficial in contributing to better mental health outcomes in patients who suffer from inflammatory disorders [1], [41], [42], [43], [44]. The purpose of this article is to highlight current and developing knowledge of the positive effects of exercise on mental health. Section snippets Methodology This review article presents current knowledge of the benefits associated with exercise on mental health and the physiological and psychological mechanisms contributing to these benefits. PubMed, Google Scholar and Medline were searched for relevant articles using the following key terms: Exercise OR physical activity AND mental health, exercise OR physical activity AND depression, exercise OR physical activity AND stress, exercise OR physical activity AND anxiety, exercise AND inflammation, Exercise and mental health There has been much research into the effects of exercise on mental health [45], [46]. This research repeatedly suggests that regular physical activity can significantly improve mental health and lessen symptoms of depression anxiety and stress [14], [47], [48], [49], [50]. It is even suggested that physical activity can enhance mental wellbeing as equally as psychotherapy [49]. In fact, just 20–40 min of aerobic exercise can improve anxiety and mood for several hours, although people suffering The physiological mechanisms of exercise on mood states There are several physiological and biochemical hypotheses put forward as to why exercise improves mood and mental health. These include the endorphin hypothesis, the thermogenic hypothesis, mitochondrial dysfunction, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), neurotransmitter dysfunction and the hypothalamic pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, all of which have been proposed to play a mechanistic role in altered mental states (Fig. 1). The psychological mechanisms of exercise on mood states When discussing the effects of exercise on mental health it is pertinent to consider the psychosocial aspects at play. Exercise routines and physical activity through sport have been shown to provide a distraction from negative thoughts and ruminations, and a boost in self-esteem through self-efficacy or mastery. The often social aspect of physical activity can also provide an outlet for people suffering from depression, anxiety and/or stress [99]. The inflammatory mechanisms of exercise on mood states Chronic inflammation is a prime contributor to chronic diseases, leading cause of death in the world [102]. Chronic inflammation has also been attributed to the pathogenesis of depression and poor mental health [41]. There is a growing body of evidence linking the immune and nervous systems. It is becoming increasingly clearer, that the immune system plays a vital part in the pathogenesis of mental health disorders. These can include anxiety, mood changes and depression. Often it is the under Conclusion Mental health disorders including those of anxiety, depression and stress are usually treated with medication and psychotherapy. Some individuals however, prefer alternative approaches such as exercise. We present here evidence that exercise can alleviate symptoms of anxiety, depression, and stress states. It is clear that exercise improves mental well-being and is a viable preventative or adjunct treatment option for improved mental health outcomes. Contributors K.M. and V.A. wrote the article.

The existing literature suggests that physical activity (PA), exercise, and aerobic fitness promote well-being and reduce risk of mental health problems. In this review, we focus on PA, exercise, and fitness as modifiable resilience factors that may help promote self-regulation via strengthening of top-down control of bottom-up processes in the brain, thereby acting as a buffer against mental health problems during this period of vulnerability. First, we briefly review the link between PA, exercise, and aerobic fitness with mental well-being and reduced mental health problems in adolescence. Then we present how impairments in self-regulation, which involves top-down control to modulate bottom-up processes, are common across a wide range of mental health disorders. Finally, we use the extant neuroimaging literature to highlight how neural systems underlying top-down control continue to develop across adolescence, and propose that PA, exercise, and aerobic fitness may facilitate resilience through strengthening individual brain regions as well as large-scale neural circuits to improve emotional and behavioral regulation. Future neuroimaging studies assessing the effects of PA, exercise, and aerobic fitness at various developmental stages in each sex and studies considering the characteristics (e.g., frequency, intensity, type) and social context of PA and exercise are vital to better understand both macro- and microscale mechanisms by which these behaviors and attributes may facilitate mental health resilience during adolescent development. Physical activity, exercise, and chronic diseases: A brief review 2019, Sports Medicine and Health Science Show abstract Chronic diseases are the leading cause of death worldwide with increasing prevalence in all age groups, genders, and ethnicities. Most chronic disease deaths occur in middle-to low-income countries but are also a significant health problem in developed nations. Multiple chronic diseases now affect children and adolescents as well as adults. Being physically inactive is associated with increased chronic disease risk. Global societies are being negatively impacted by the increasing prevalence of chronic disease which is directly related to rising healthcare expenditures, workforce complications regarding attendance and productivity, military personnel recruitment, and academic success. However, increased physical activity (PA) and exercise are associated with reduced chronic disease risk. Most physiologic systems in the body benefit positively from PA and exercise by primary disease prevention and secondary disease prevention/treatment. The purpose of this brief review is to describe the significant global problem of chronic diseases for adults and children, and how PA and exercise can provide a non-invasive means for added prevention and treatment.

However, cardio isn’t a one-size-fits-all approach. Different methods can yield varied results depending on your goals, fitness level, and lifestyle. To lose weight effectively through cardio, it’s essential to understand how to optimise your workout. This article will explore how to do cardio the right way at the gym, focusing on the science behind fat loss, cardio modalities, workout intensity, and the balance between cardio and strength training. The Science Behind Weight Loss and Cardio Before delving into cardio methods, it’s important to understand the fundamental principles of weight loss. Weight loss occurs when you create a calorie deficit, meaning you burn more calories than you consume. This can be achieved by reducing your caloric intake, increasing physical activity, or both. Cardiovascular exercise helps by increasing the number of calories burned. Fat Loss vs Weight Loss It’s crucial to distinguish between fat loss and weight loss. Weight loss refers to a reduction in overall body weight, which could involve losing water weight, lean muscle mass, or fat. Fat loss specifically targets reducing body fat. For long-term health and aesthetics, losing fat while preserving muscle mass is ideal. Types of Cardio for Weight Loss Different types of cardio workouts can offer various benefits, but when it comes to weight loss, some are more effective than others. The most common forms of cardio include steady-state cardio, high-intensity interval training (HIIT), and low-intensity steady-state cardio (LISS). Steady-State Cardio Steady-state cardio involves performing aerobic exercise at a consistent, moderate pace for an extended period, typically lasting 30 minutes to an hour. This could include jogging, cycling, rowing, or using the elliptical machine. Steady-state cardio is highly effective for improving cardiovascular endurance and burning calories. A study published in the Journal of Obesity found that steady-state cardio can be effective for fat loss when combined with a calorie-controlled diet . However, the main drawback is that the body adapts to this type of exercise over time, potentially reducing its efficacy unless progressively adjusted in terms of intensity or duration. High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) HIIT involves short bursts of high-intensity activity followed by periods of rest or low-intensity exercise. An example of HIIT is alternating between 30 seconds of sprinting and 60 seconds of walking on the treadmill. These workouts are typically shorter, lasting 20–30 minutes, but they have been shown to burn calories more efficiently than steady-state cardio in a shorter time frame. A study published in The Journal of Sports Medicine and Physical Fitness suggests that HIIT may be more effective for fat loss compared to traditional steady-state cardio due to its ability to boost metabolic rate and increase post-exercise oxygen consumption (EPOC) . This means that your body continues to burn calories after the workout has ended, often referred to as the “afterburn effect.” Low-Intensity Steady-State Cardio (LISS) LISS is similar to steady-state cardio but performed at a lower intensity. Activities like walking on a treadmill or using a stationary bike at a low pace for 45–60 minutes fall into this category. LISS is often recommended for beginners or those looking for a more relaxed form of cardio. While LISS burns fewer calories per minute than HIIT, it’s gentler on the joints and easier to sustain for longer periods. It can be a good option for individuals recovering from injuries or looking to increase their daily caloric expenditure without excessive fatigue. 5 Signs You Are Burning Fat, NOT Muscle How Much Cardio Is Needed for Weight Loss? The amount of cardio needed for weight loss depends on several factors, including your diet, current body weight, and fitness level. According to the American College of Sports Medicine , for significant weight loss, individuals should aim for 300 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per week . This translates to roughly 5 hours of exercise per week, which could be broken down into five 60-minute sessions of moderate-intensity cardio or more frequent shorter sessions of higher-intensity workouts. Frequency and Duration For optimal fat loss, aim to incorporate cardio into your routine 3–5 times per week. Balancing cardio with other forms of exercise, such as resistance training, is essential for preserving lean muscle mass while losing fat. If you’re new to exercise, start with 20–30 minutes per session and gradually increase the duration as your fitness level improves. Combining Cardio and Strength Training While cardio is essential for burning calories, strength training plays a crucial role in maintaining muscle mass during weight loss. A study from The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition emphasised the importance of combining cardio with strength training to optimise fat loss and prevent muscle loss during a calorie deficit . Muscle mass increases your resting metabolic rate, meaning you’ll burn more calories at rest, which can accelerate fat loss over time. 12 Must-Have Exercises In Your Training Program Optimising Your Cardio Sessions Getting the most out of your cardio sessions requires more than just hopping on a treadmill and running for 30 minutes. Consider the following strategies to maximise the effectiveness of your cardio workouts. Train in Different Heart Rate Zones Training in different heart rate zones can help target specific fitness goals. These zones are typically expressed as percentages of your maximum heart rate (MHR), which is roughly calculated by subtracting your age from 220. Zone 1 (50–60% of MHR): This is a light, low-intensity zone often used for recovery or very long-duration cardio sessions. It primarily burns fat, but at a slower rate. Zone 2 (60–70% of MHR): This zone is often referred to as the “fat-burning zone” as the body primarily uses fat as a fuel source. It’s best for longer, steady-state cardio. Zone 3 (70–80% of MHR): This is a moderate to high-intensity zone where the body starts to use more carbohydrates for energy. It improves cardiovascular endurance. Zone 4 (80–90% of MHR): This zone is used for high-intensity exercise like interval training. It burns more calories but relies heavily on glycogen (stored carbohydrates) for fuel. Zone 5 (90–100% of MHR): Maximal effort zone used in short bursts for activities like sprints or HIIT. It can only be sustained for a few seconds to a minute and burns a high number of calories in a short period. By varying your cardio workouts between different heart rate zones, you can target fat loss while improving overall cardiovascular fitness. The Most Underrated Cardio Routine for Fat Loss Cardio Equipment: What to Choose? The gym is filled with cardio machines, and each offers unique benefits. Choosing the right machine depends on your fitness level, preferences, and specific goals. Treadmill Running or walking on a treadmill is one of the most common forms of cardio. It’s versatile and allows you to adjust speed and incline for varying intensity. Incline walking, for example, can increase the calorie burn without the high impact of running. Stationary Bike Cycling on a stationary bike is a low-impact form of cardio that can be ideal for people with joint issues. It’s also easy to incorporate into HIIT workouts by alternating between high-resistance sprints and low-resistance recovery periods. Rowing Machine Source: Photo courtesy of CrossFit Inc. The rowing machine offers a full-body workout that combines cardiovascular endurance with strength training. It’s an excellent choice for burning calories while engaging multiple muscle groups, including the legs, back, and arms. Elliptical Trainer The elliptical provides a low-impact cardio option that mimics running without the stress on the joints. It’s also effective for engaging both the upper and lower body when using the handles. Stair Climber The stair climber is a challenging option that targets the lower body while providing a cardiovascular workout. It’s particularly effective for building leg strength while burning calories. Progression: How to Avoid Plateaus One of the biggest challenges in any fitness journey is avoiding plateaus. A plateau occurs when your body becomes accustomed to a certain level of exercise and calorie expenditure, causing weight loss to slow down or stop. To avoid this, it’s crucial to implement progression in your cardio workouts. Gradual Increase in Intensity Progressively increasing the intensity of your cardio workouts can help you continue losing weight. This could involve increasing the incline on the treadmill, adding resistance to the stationary bike, or incorporating more sprints into your HIIT sessions. Vary Your Workouts Changing your cardio routine regularly helps prevent boredom and ensures that your body doesn’t become too efficient at one type of exercise. Consider alternating between different cardio machines or mixing up your routine with outdoor activities like cycling or swimming. Incorporate Strength Training To maintain muscle mass and further boost your metabolism, include strength training in your routine. Resistance training builds muscle, which in turn increases your resting metabolic rate, making it easier to lose fat. Cardio and Nutrition: A Balanced Approach Cardio alone isn’t enough to guarantee weight loss. What you eat is just as important as how you train. To lose weight, you must be in a calorie deficit, which means burning more calories than you consume. The Role of Macronutrients Protein: Protein is crucial during a weight loss phase to help preserve muscle mass. Aim for 1.6 to 2.2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day, depending on your activity level and goals . Carbohydrates: While carbs have been demonised in some diets, they are essential for providing energy during cardio sessions, especially high-intensity workouts like HIIT. Fats: Healthy fats are necessary for hormone production and overall health. They also help you feel fuller for longer, which can aid in weight loss when in a calorie deficit. Tips to Lose a LOT of Body Fat WITHOUT Counting Calories Timing Your Meals Around Cardio When performing cardio, meal timing can make a difference in your energy levels and overall performance. Eating a small meal or snack that includes carbohydrates and protein about 30–60 minutes before your cardio session can provide the energy needed for an intense workout. Post-workout, aim to consume a meal with protein and carbohydrates within 1–2 hours to support muscle recovery and replenish glycogen stores. Rest and Recovery: The Missing Ingredient Rest and recovery are often overlooked components of a successful weight loss strategy. Overtraining can lead to burnout, injury, and a plateau in weight loss progress. Ensure you’re getting enough rest between intense cardio sessions, especially if you’re incorporating HIIT or long-duration workouts. Importance of Sleep Sleep plays a critical role in weight loss and overall health. Research published in the Annals of Internal Medicine found that individuals who were sleep-deprived lost more lean body mass compared to those who were well-rested, despite being in a calorie deficit . Aim for 7–9 hours of sleep per night to support recovery and optimise fat loss. Conclusion: Cardio for Sustainable Weight Loss Cardio is a powerful tool for weight loss when done correctly. The key is to find a balance between the type, intensity, and frequency of cardio that works for you while incorporating strength training and following a nutrient-dense diet. By varying your workouts, tracking your progress, and prioritising recovery, you can achieve sustainable weight loss and improved overall fitness. Key Takeaways Factor Recommendation Types of Cardio Incorporate a mix of steady-state cardio, HIIT, and LISS for optimal results. Frequency & Duration Aim for 3–5 cardio sessions per week, with workouts lasting 20–60 minutes. Cardio Equipment Choose equipment that suits your goals and fitness level, such as treadmills, bikes, or rowing machines. Heart Rate Zones Vary your cardio intensity by training in different heart rate zones to maximise fat burning. Progression Increase intensity gradually and vary your workouts to avoid plateaus. Strength Training Combine cardio with strength training to preserve muscle mass and enhance fat loss. Nutrition Focus on a balanced diet rich in protein, carbohydrates, and healthy fats to support weight loss. Recovery & Sleep Ensure adequate rest and aim for 7–9 hours of sleep per night to optimise fat loss. References American College of Sports Medicine, 2014.

Acute responses to the 7-minute workout. J Strength Cond Res 31(9): 2572–2578, 2017—A popular smartphone application called the 7-Minute Workout (7Min) claims to be scientifically proven to promote weight loss and improve cardiovascular function. The application has 10 million downloads and has been reviewed by 350,000 users. However, changes in metabolic and perceptual variables in response to 7Min are unknown. Our study compared acute responses between 7Min and a time-matched session of cycling-based high-intensity interval exercise (HIIE). Fourteen active men and women (age and V̇ o 2 max = 25.4 ± 8.3 years and 40.5 ± 6.4 ml·kg −1 ·min −1 ) initially underwent V̇ o 2 max testing. During 2 subsequent sessions separated by ≥48 hours, they completed 7Min or HIIE. During exercise, oxygen uptake (V̇ o 2 ), heart rate (HR), blood lactate concentration (BLa), and rating of perceived exertion were measured. Peak V̇ o 2 was higher ( p < 0.001) in HIIE vs. 7Min, and HIIE yielded greater ( p < 0.001) mean V̇ o 2 (1.83 ± 0.41 L·min −1 vs. 1.44 ± 0.32 L·min −1 ) and HR (159.0 ± 10.7 b·min −1 vs. 140.7 ± 18.3 b·min −1 , p < 0.001) vs. 7Min. Blood lactate concentration increased ( p < 0.001) during exercise but was similar between bouts ( p = 0.07). Rating of perceived exertion was higher ( p = 0.008) in response to HIIE vs. 7Min. Although 7Min yields lower peak V̇ o 2 and HR than HIIE, it is characterized by bursts approaching 90 %HRmax and causes significant BLa accumulation, representing vigorous exercise. Nevertheless, 7Min is on the low end of the intensity spectrum, which questions whether it represents true HIIE and will confer similar benefits if performed long term. Introduction Current physical activity guidelines in adults recommend completion of 150 min·wk −1 of moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT) or 75 min·wk −1 of vigorous activity ( 15 ). Nevertheless, the frequency of regular participation in physical activity is low ( 9 ), which reduces cardiorespiratory fitness as determined by maximal oxygen uptake (V̇ o 2 max). This low fitness level has implications for morbidity and mortality, as cross-sectional studies ( 21,26 ) show that V̇ o 2 max is related to health status and risk of cardiac events. One of the most commonly cited barriers to regular exercise participation is lack of time ( 34 ) which has caused fitness and health professionals to explore alternative exercise approaches to MICT. High-intensity interval training (HIIT) is characterized by brief, intense bursts of activity at near-maximal workloads separated by recovery. A more intense modality of HIIT is sprint interval training (SIT) which is performed at supramaximal intensities and has lower training volume than HIIT. Typically, HIIT and SIT require lower exercise time than MICT which makes them more time efficient. Many studies conducted in healthy adults show that chronic HIIT and SIT lead to similar ( 8,13 ) and in some cases superior adaptations ( 27 ) compared with MICT. A review of 28 studies comprising 723 participants ( 25 ) demonstrated greater increases in maximal oxygen uptake (V̇ o 2 max) in response to HIIT vs. MICT in healthy adults. Consequently, there is growing interest in the utility of HIIT as a countermeasure to the low frequency of physical activity widely seen in most adults. However, HIIT as described above is typically performed in a laboratory setting requiring use of cycle ergometers and motor-driven treadmills which are operated by trained personnel. In addition, the laboratory personnel construct all exercise protocols and provide substantial support and motivation to the participant, which reduces the “real-world” application of these particular HIIT regimes outside the laboratory setting. Nevertheless, HIIT has been identified as one of the top trends in health and fitness ( 33 ), despite only few studies exploring its efficacy and practicality when performed outside a laboratory. In overweight, sedentary adults, no change in V̇ o 2 max was shown in response to 12 weeks of HIIT which was performed in a group setting at a park ( 22 ). The lack of changes may be due to the low participant adherence to HIIT (59–75%). By contrast, significant increases in V̇ o 2 max and insulin sensitivity as well as improved blood lipid profiles were shown in response to 10 weeks of group-based, instructor-led HIIT cycling ( 30 ). Despite the significant health-related adaptations demonstrated in this study, HIIT was supervised by a trained instructor, and participants had the support of others who were training at the gym. These equivocal data suggest that more convenient and easily accessible forms of high-intensity interval exercise (HIIE) need to be developed, especially those performed without supervision and using modern technology such as various web-based applications. In fact, Gray et al. ( 18 ) encouraged scientists to test the utility of HIIE outside a laboratory or gym to places including the home. One workout that has become widely popular is the 7-Minute Workout (7Min). This workout is designed to mirror a typical HIIE session in that it uses short bouts of all-out exercise interspersed with brief recovery periods. However, it differs vs. traditional HIIE, as it uses various body weight exercises rather than cycling, and there is no need for any specialized equipment. One study in active men and women ( 29 ) showed that 24 sessions of 7Min led to significant increases in muscle endurance, but no changes in V̇ o 2 max or body fat were demonstrated. Another study requiring healthy individuals to complete 7Min daily for 6 weeks showed small reductions in body fat and waist circumference ( 23 ). However, no studies have examined the intensity of 7Min or compared it with any other HIIE regimes. Without empirical data, it is misleading to claim that their exercise is “scientifically proven.” Researching the intensity of this regime is important because if 7Min is shown to elicit intensities associated with HIIE, it can potentially provide clients a true HIIE-based workout in the comfort of their home and serve as a widely accessible alternative to traditional MICT or HIIE. It is evident that adaptation to exercise training is the accumulated effect of specific transcriptional and translational “microadaptations” occurring after each exercise bout ( 12 ), and the magnitude of the stimulus received from acute bouts may partially underlie individual variation in long-term training responses. The aim of this study was to compare acute physiological and perceptual responses between a single session of cycling-based HIIE and 7Min. We hypothesized that HIIE would elicit higher heart rate (HR) and V̇ o 2 responses vs. 7Min. Methods Experimental Approach to the Problem This study used a randomized, within-subjects crossover design. All sessions were held between 09:30 and 12:30 and were preceded by 24-hour abstention from physical activity and no food for 3 hours. Participants were instructed to come to the laboratory hydrated and well rested, which were confirmed with a written log. Initially, V̇ o 2 max was measured to determine cardiorespiratory fitness and peak power output (PPO). At the same time of day at least 48 hours later, participants completed 7Min or HIIE and then returned at least 48 hours later to complete the other bout. During exercise, HR, V̇ o 2 , blood lactate concentration (BLa), and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) were measured. All bouts were completed within a 2-week period. Subjects Habitually active individuals (7 men and 7 women) between the ages 19 and 45 years participated in this study. They regularly completed resistance training, noncompetitive sport, CrossFit, surfing, and aerobic exercise, but none was training for a particular sport. Their physical characteristics are shown in Table 1 . Participants were not pregnant, did not smoke, or have knee or joint ailments or any pre-existing health condition, which were confirmed through completion of a health-history questionnaire, which may preclude their participation. Participants provided written informed consent, and all study procedures were approved by the California State University–San Marcos Institutional Review Board. Table 1.: Participant physical characteristics (mean ± SD , N = 14).* Procedures Initially, height (cm) and body mass (kg) were measured using a laboratory scale and stadiometer. Subsequently, participants were prepared for ramp-based incremental exercise on an electrically braked cycle ergometer (Velotron Dynafit Pro, RacerMate Inc., Seattle, WA, USA) to measure V̇ o 2 max and PPO. Exercise began with a 2-minute warm-up at 40–60 W followed by 20–30 W·min −1 increases in work rate until volitional exhaustion was attained (pedal cadence <50 rev per minute). V̇ o 2 max was identified as the mean value of the last 2 data points, and its attainment was confirmed using 2 of the following 3 criteria: respiratory exchange ratio >1.10, HR within 10 b·min −1 of 220—age, and a plateau in V̇ o 2 ( 1 ). All participants met at least 2 of these criteria. During exercise, pulmonary gas exchange data were obtained every 15 seconds using a metabolic cart (ParvoMedics True One, Sandy, UT, USA), which was calibrated pre-exercise according to the manufacturer. Participants wore noseclips and breathed through a 3-way valve. 7-Minute Workout and High-Intensity Interval Exercise Both protocols were preceded by a 5-minute warm-up at 20 % PPO. The 7Min workout consisted of twelve 30-second bouts consisting of these exercises in the following order: jumping jacks, wall sit, push-ups, abdominal crunches, step-ups onto chair, squats, triceps dips on chair, planks, high knees, lunges, push-up with rotation, and side planks. Participants were instructed to perform as many repetitions as possible during each 30-second bout. Each bout was followed by 10 seconds of passive recovery during which participants quickly changed body position to prepare for the subsequent bout. During HIIE, participants cycled for 7 minutes at a self-selected cadence between 60 and 90 rev per minute. The duration of this HIIE bout was matched to 7Min, and both protocols involved 6 minutes of work. During HIIE, twelve 30-second bouts at 70 % PPO were completed, with each bout separated by a 10-second active recovery at 20 % PPO. Preliminary testing determined that this was the highest intensity that could be tolerated by nonathletic individuals with such brief recovery periods. This protocol elicits an intensity of approximately 80–90 %HRmax, similar to that used in previous training studies ( 2,20 ) showing that HIIT, when performed at this intensity and with slightly higher volume, led to significant increases in V̇ o 2 max. During exercise, oxygen uptake and HR (Polar, Woodbury, NY, USA) were continuously measured and expressed every 15 seconds. Oxygen uptake was obtained following identical procedures used in V̇ o 2 max testing. Mean HR and V̇ o 2 values were averaged from the 2 data points obtained during each exercise bout and the one proceeding it in recovery. Blood lactate concentration was obtained before exercise with the participant seated in a chair, and at 33% (immediately after bout 4) and 66% of bout duration (immediately after bout 8) and 3 minutes after exercise. A small amount of blood (total volume = 20 μL) was taken from each subject's fingertip using a lancet (Owen Mumford, Inc., Marietta, GA, USA), and a portable monitor (Lactate Plus, Nova Biomedical, Waltham, MA, USA) was used to determine BLa. In addition, RPE ( 6 ) was taken at the same time as BLa. The meaning of the category ratio (CR-10) scale was communicated by instructing participants to report perceptions of their exertion in terms of their breathing, HR, and level of fatigue. For this scale, a score of 1 represents no exertion and a score of 10 represents maximal exertion. Statistical Analyses Data are expressed as mean ± SD and were analyzed using SPSS Version 20.0 (Chicago, IL, USA). The Shapiro-Wilks test was used to assess normality. Two-way analysis of variance with repeated measures was used to compare changes in dependent variables across time (4 and 12 levels) and protocol (HIIE vs. 7Min). If a significant F ratio was obtained, Tukey's post hoc test was used to identify differences between mean values. A dependent t -test was used to examine differences in calorie expenditure and mean/peak HR and V̇ o 2 between protocols. Cohen's d was used as an estimate of effect size. Our sample size is similar to previous studies comparing physiological responses between various HIIE protocols ( 14,16,36 ), and G Power ( 11 ) showed that a sample size equal to 8 was adequate to detect a 0.1 L·min −1 difference in oxygen uptake between bouts. Statistical significance was set at p ≤ 0.05. Results Change in V̇ o 2 and Calorie Expenditure Data in Figure 1A show that V̇ o 2 increased during exercise ( p < 0.001) and that there was a time × protocol interaction ( p < 0.001). Post hoc analyses showed that V̇ o 2 was significantly higher in response to HIIE vs. 7Min at all time points (Cohen's d ranging from 0.46 to 2.31). V̇ o 2 during HIIE consistently increased from bout 1 (1.52 ± 0.32 L·min −1 ) to bout 8 (2.38 ± 0.48 L·min −1 ) and increased further to bout 11 when it peaked at 2.49 ± 0.47 L·min −1 , equal to 83 %V̇ o 2 max. V̇ o 2 for 7Min varied based on the exercise performed, as it increased from bout 1 to bout 2 (0.92 ± 0.19 to 1.27 ± 0.31 L·min −1 , jumping jacks to wall sit), then decreased in response to bout 3 (1.19 ± 0.23 L·min −1 , push-ups). Subsequently, V̇ o 2 continued to rise until bout 7 (2.06 ± 0.44 L·min −1 , triceps dips). In bout 8 (1.70 ± 0.36 L·min −1 , planks), it was reduced, yet increased again in the latter stages of 7Min to a peak value equal to 73 %V̇ o 2 max in response to bout 10 (2.18 ± 0.48 L·min −1 , lunges). Mean (1.49 ± 0.32 L·min −1 vs. 1.83 ± 0.41 L·min −1 , p < 0.001, d = 0.96) and peak V̇ o 2 (2.45 ± 0.50 L·min −1 vs. 2.73 ± 0.54 L·min −1 , p = 0.001, d = 0.60) was lower in 7Min compared with HIIE. Calorie expenditure was lower ( p = 0.002, d = 0.80) during 7Min (76.2 ± 18.0 kcal, range = 43–121 kcal) than HIIE (89.0 ± 17.6 kcal, range = 60–113 kcal). Figure 1.: Differences in (A) oxygen uptake, (B) heart rate (HR), and (C) rating of perceived exertion in response to high intensity interval exercise (HIIE) compared with 7-Minute Workout (7Min) (mean ± SD ). * p ≤ 0.05 between HIIT and 7Min. The V̇ o 2 and HR data presented for each bout represent the mean value of the 2 data points during exercise and the value in recovery. Change in Heart Rate and Rating of Perceived Exertion Heart rate gradually increased ( p < 0.001) during 7Min and HIIE, but there was no time × protocol interaction ( p = 0.09) ( Figure 1B ). During 7Min, HR increased from bout 1 (jumping jacks, 119.0 ± 9.6 b·min −1 ) to bout 2 (wall sit, 132.4 ± 13.8 b·min −1 ) after which it was sustained until bout 5 (step-up onto chair, 142.9 ± 16.9 b·min −1 ). In response to bout 6 (squats, 149.0 ± 23.6 b·min −1 ), HR further increased but was maintained up to bout 9 (high knees, 165.3 ± 17.4 b·min −1 ) after which it continued to increase after bout 11 (push-up with rotation, 164.6 ± 17.1 b·min −1 ). During HIIE, HR steadily increased throughout exercise from bout 1 (134.6 ± 15.2 b·min −1 ) to bout 12 where it peaked at 170.4 ± 18.6 b·min −1 which is equivalent to 93 %HRmax. Peak HR was lower ( p = 0.015, d = 0.40) during 7Min (168.6 ± 17.0 b·min −1 ) compared with HIIE (175.3 ± 16.5 b·min −1 ). Average HR was higher in response to HIIE vs. 7Min (159.0 ± 10.7 b·min −1 vs. 140.7 ± 18.3 b·min −1 , p < 0.001, d = 0.85). Similar to HR, RPE increased during exercise ( p < 0.001), and there was a time × protocol interaction ( p = 0.008) ( Figure 1C ). High-intensity interval exercise demonstrated higher RPE than 7Min at bout 4 (3.9 ± 0.8 vs. 3.1 ± 0.9, d = 0.98) as well as at end exercise (6.0 ± 1.1 vs. 5.0 ± 0.9, d = 1.03). Change in Blood Lactate Concentration Baseline values of BLa were similar between HIIE (1.4 ± 0.4 mM) and 7Min (1.1 ± 0.3 mM). Blood lactate concentration increased during exercise ( p < 0.001), but there was no time × protocol interaction ( p = 0.07), although BLa values acquired at bout 8 and postexercise were higher in 7Min vs. HIIE. These data are shown in Figure 2 . Figure 2.: Differences in blood lactate concentration in response to high-intensity interval training (HIIT) compared with 7-Minute Workout (7Min) (mean ± SD ). Discussion The aim of our study was to compare the acute responses of a laboratory-based HIIE regime to a whole-body 7Min which can be performed at home without specialized equipment or close supervision. In response to HIIE, participants revealed significantly higher V̇ o 2 , perceived exertion, and calorie expenditure compared with 7Min, but changes in BLa were similar. The peak HR and V̇ o 2 of 7Min were equal to 90 %HRmax and 81 %V̇ o 2 max, respectively, which would require bursts of relatively intense exercise similar to that found in HIIE. Nevertheless, the greater mean and peak V̇ o 2 , HR, and RPE in HIIE suggest a greater acute cardiorespiratory and metabolic stimulus than 7Min, which places 7Min on the lower end of the intensity spectrum typically associated with MICT. The 7-minute HIIE bout used in this study was completed at 70 % PPO, which is similar to work rates used in previous studies using HIIT to improve V̇ o 2 max in sedentary populations ( 2,19 ). This bout elicited peak HR and V̇ o 2 equivalent to 93 %HRmax and 91 %V̇ o 2 max, respectively, as well as significant accumulation of BLa. Similar near-maximal intensities were revealed in a study by Skelly et al. ( 32 ), in which men completed 10 bouts of HIIE at workload equal to 90 %HRmax. However, the absolute oxygen uptake of our protocol (1.83 L·min −1 and 1.49 L·min −1 ) is lower than that reported by Skelly et al. ( 32 ), which is attributed to the lower duration and volume of exercise completed in the current study as well as their use of exclusively men as participants who were heavier (mass = 91 kg) and fitter (V̇ o 2 max = 46 ml·kg −1 ·min −1 ). Nevertheless, a similar relative cardiorespiratory strain (peak HR ∼95 %HRmax) was demonstrated in young men and women performing eight 1-minute HIIE bouts at 85 % PPO separated by 1-minute recovery ( 36 ). Therefore, the 7-minute bout of cycling as used in this study represents a legitimate form of HIIE. Our data show 10–40% higher V̇ o 2 throughout HIIE vs. 7Min ( Figure 1A ) as well as significantly higher mean and peak V̇ o 2 . Despite the lower mean and peak V̇ o 2 response observed in 7Min compared with HIIE, it is characterized by frequent bursts of activity requiring near-maximal effort. Nevertheless, the mean HR of 7Min was equal to 73 %HRmax which is classified as moderate exercise according to the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) ( 15 ). In fact, the mean HR of 7Min is similar to the intensity seen with 50 minutes of MICT equal to 70 %HRmax ( 32 ). By contrast, the mean HR value characteristic of HIIE (159 b·min −1 ) was similar to that reported in men completing the 4 × 4 or 16 × 1-HIIE bouts ( 35 ), and approximately 20 b·min −1 higher than that elicited from 7Min. Together, these findings suggest that 7Min as currently developed is not a suitable form of HIIE. Some data report that chronic whole-body HIIT may result in significant improvements in health and fitness. In response to 6 weeks of multimodal circuit HIIT training including high-load strength training, significant increases in V̇ o 2 max, anaerobic power, and anaerobic threshold were demonstrated which are similar in magnitude to adaptations accrued from rowing-based HIIT ( 7 ). Nevertheless, multimodal training led to increased strength which was not observed in response to rowing. However, this multimodal regime was 60 minutes in duration, which makes it impractical for most exercisers. In recreationally active women (V̇ o 2 max = 43.0 ml·kg −1 ·min −1 ), 4 weeks of extremely low-volume whole-body aerobic-resistance training consisting of burpees, jumping jacks, mountain climbers, and squat thrusts led to significant increases in V̇ o 2 max and muscle endurance ( 24 ). However, this study demonstrated higher HR and RPE than found in the current study ( Figure 1 ) which may elicit superior adaptation compared with 7Min, which presents lower cardiorespiratory and perceptual strain. These enhancements in physical fitness are impressive, considering that their regime only required 4 minutes of training time per day. Moreover, the improvement in cardiorespiratory fitness is important, considering that a 1-MET increase in V̇ o 2 max is associated with a 13–15% lower risk of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular event ( 21 ). However, the utility of this particular regime for inactive persons is unknown, especially considering that mean HR was ∼90 %HRmax, and RPE peaked at 17.3 ± 1.4 on the Borg 6–20 scale ( 5 ). An interesting finding of this study is the different V̇ o 2 and HR response observed during various exercises comprising 7Min ( Figure 1A, B ). Heart rate and V̇ o 2 were highest when dynamic lower-body exercise including high knees, lunges, step-ups onto a chair, and squats were performed; whereas, lower V̇ o 2 and HR were evident when participants completed small muscle mass exercise (triceps dip), passive exercise (wall sit), or were supine as in the case of planks and abdominal crunches. Compared with more dynamic exercises, the wall sit and abdominal exercises are characterized by a lower force which is commensurate with a lower metabolic rate. Replacing these exercises with dynamic, multijoint movements including burpees, deadlifts, or box jumps would further increase the muscle mass engaged and overall intensity of this bout ( 24 ). Rating of perceived exertion was higher in response to HIIE, despite no difference in BLa between protocols but higher mean and peak HR vs. 7Min. Our RPE values for 7Min at end exercise (5.0 ± 0.9, “hard”) are similar to RPE (14.5 ± 2.2 on the Borg ( 5 ) 6–20 scale, representing hard) exhibited in response to another form of HIIE, intense calisthenics ( 16 ). The 7Min protocol requires activation of whole-body musculature which allows the force to be distributed across a wider range of muscles compared with cycling, which is highly dependent on the knee extensors and flexors and has been reported to elicit substantial pain ( 10 ). Consequently, the different pattern of muscle mass used may have led to lower perceptions of exertion during 7Min than HIIE. In fact, most participants preferred 7Min vs. HIIE and rated it as being easier. The RPE and V̇ o 2 data support this claim. Blood lactate concentration increased in response to both HIIE and 7Min to values greater than 4 mM, which is associated with the onset of the lactate threshold ( 17 ) and a transition to higher intensity exercise. The slightly greater BLa values in 7Min vs. HIIE may be caused by the recruitment of more fast-twitch, nonoxidative muscle fibers in muscles of the trunk, upper body, and gluteals required to perform exercises including planks, push-ups, triceps dips, lunges, and squats. Our BLa values are lower than those reported for Wingate-based SIT and repeated burpees ( 16 ). However, BLa values from 7Min are similar to those reported (∼6.0 mM) in women performing 3 sets of 10 exercises of whole-body resistance exercise ( 4 ). The activation of all fiber types in more areas of the body would elicit higher BLa than when primarily the leg muscles are activated ( 14 ). Our data can only be applied to healthy active men and women, so dissimilar results may be found in sedentary individuals or those familiar with circuit training similar to 7Min. The HIIE protocol used in this study was completed at lower intensities than previously used ( 2,3,16 ), as we needed to select an intensity that elicited interval exercise, yet was not too rigorous for our relatively nonathletic population to complete with such brief recovery between bouts. However, its mean and peak HR response equal to 86 % and 93 %HRmax and substantial BLa accumulation would suggest that it represents a true form of HIIE. Moreover, we matched the protocols for duration to ensure that any difference observed between HIIE and 7Min was not due to greater training time. We advised participants to exercise maximally during 7Min, but it was evident that during some exercises, deficits in strength or physical function led to a lower number of repetitions performed and potentially lower HR and V̇ o 2 response. We recommend that home-based workouts such as 7Min introduce greater flexibility of individual exercises to better apply to clients of diverse fitness and muscular function, which may allow individuals to attain various health-related benefits, including enhanced cardiorespiratory fitness, muscular endurance, or fat loss, as reported in recent studies ( 23,29 ). Lastly, both bouts were preceded by a brief warm-up which may not be feasible for home-based exercise. Exercise duration is a key factor in adherence to exercise. In fact, the number 1 reason for not participating in physical activity is due to time constraints ( 34 ). Recent studies show that chronic HIIT promotes improvements in V̇ o 2 max ( 2,7 ), insulin sensitivity ( 28 ), and fat loss ( 19 ) and may require less time compared with prolonged MICT. Our data show that despite similar exercise duration, a single session of cycling-based HIIE elicits higher mean and peak HR and V̇ o 2 as well as calorie expenditure vs. the whole-body 7Min workout. Recent studies ( 23,29 ) show small increases in V̇ o 2 max and muscle endurance and reductions in fat mass in response to chronic exercise using 7Min, but these adaptations did not occur in all participants. Future research should compare long-term responses to this protocol, especially considering that 7Min is easily accessible and has the potential to increase both muscular fitness and V̇ o 2 max which are independently associated with health risk ( 26,31 ). Practical Applications Our results are useful for fitness professionals who prescribe HIIE, which has infinite permutations varying in intensity, duration, number of bouts, and recovery interval. Unlike most HIIE protocols which are confined to a laboratory or a group exercise setting, 7Min is accessible to a wide range of individuals who desire to exercise in their home. Our data show that 7Min elicits substantial changes in HR, oxygen uptake, and BLa, but they are of insufficient magnitude to represent HIIE.

Kraemer 1 , 2 & Nicholas A. Ratamess 3 26k Accesses 110 Altmetric 12 Mentions Explore all metrics Abstract Resistance exercise has been shown to elicit a significant acute hormonal response. It appears that this acute response is more critical to tissue growth and remodelling than chronic changes in resting hormonal concentrations, as many studies have not shown a significant change during resistance training despite increases in muscle strength and hypertrophy. Anabolic hormones such as testosterone and the superfamily of growth hormones (GH) have been shown to be elevated during 15–30 minutes of post-resistance exercise providing an adequate stimulus is present. Protocols high in volume, moderate to high in intensity, using short rest intervals and stressing a large muscle mass, tend to produce the greatest acute hormonal elevations (e.g. testosterone, GH and the catabolic hormone cortisol) compared with low-volume, high-intensity protocols using long rest intervals. Other anabolic hormones such as insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) are critical to skeletal muscle growth. Insulin is regulated by blood glucose and amino acid levels. However, circulating IGF-1 elevations have been reported following resistance exercise presumably in response to GH-stimulated hepatic secretion. Recent evidence indicates that muscle isoforms of IGF-1 may play a substantial role in tissue remodelling via up-regulation by mechanical signalling (i.e. increased gene expression resulting from stretch and tension to the muscle cytoskeleton leading to greater protein synthesis rates). Acute elevations in catecholamines are critical to optimal force production and energy liberation during resistance exercise. More recent research has shown the importance of acute hormonal elevations and mechanical stimuli for subsequent up- and down-regulation of cytoplasmic steroid receptors needed to mediate the hormonal effects. Other factors such as nutrition, overtraining, detraining and circadian patterns of hormone secretion are critical to examining the hormonal responses and adaptations to resistance training.

As a relatively new training modality, HIFT is often compared to high-intensity interval training (HIIT), yet the two are distinct. HIIT exercise is characterized by relatively short bursts of repeated vigorous activity, interspersed by periods of rest or low-intensity exercise for recovery, while HIFT utilizes constantly varied functional exercises and various activity durations that may or may not incorporate rest. Over the last decade, studies evaluating the effectiveness of HIIT programs have documented improvements in metabolic and cardiorespiratory adaptations; however, less is known about the effects of HIFT. The purpose of this manuscript is to provide a working definition of HIFT and review the available literature regarding its use to improve metabolic and cardiorespiratory adaptations in strength and conditioning programs among various populations. Additionally, we aim to create a definition that is used in future publications to evaluate more effectively the future impact of this type of training on health and fitness outcomes. Keywords: athletes ; military ; first responders ; exercise ; general physical preparedness 1. Introduction High-intensity interval training (HIIT) refers to an exercise program that is characterized by relatively short bursts of vigorous activity, interspersed by periods of rest or low-intensity exercise for recovery. HIIT is primarily applied utilizing aerobic exercise, such as a running on a treadmill and cycling on an ergometer [ 1 , 2 ]. Even though this type of training has been used among athletes since the later part of the 20th century [ 3 ], it recently has gained momentum among fitness enthusiasts, and has been identified as a “Top 10 Fitness Trend” in 2018 [ 4 ]. Over the last decade, studies evaluating the effectiveness of HIIT programs have shown improvements in metabolic and cardiorespiratory adaptations [ 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 ]. Additionally, Burgomaster and colleagues [ 9 ] reported significant improvements in time to exhaustion after only six sessions of HIIT over a two-week period. This increase in endurance is most noteworthy as it was accomplished without an increase in maximal oxygen consumption (VO 2max ), which suggests “peripheral” adaptations, such as changes in carbohydrate metabolism, and enzymatic activity within the muscles might be responsible for these changes [ 10 ]. Although several investigators have substantiated the benefits of HIIT, less is known about the effects of a relatively new training modality, known as high-intensity functional training (HIFT). HIFT emphasizes functional, multi-joint movements via both aerobic and muscle-strengthening exercises [ 11 ]. HIFT can be modified to any fitness level and elicits greater muscle recruitment than repetitive aerobic exercises, thereby improving cardiovascular endurance, strength, and flexibility [ 11 , 12 , 13 ]. Most studies using the HIFT methodology have used a CrossFit training template [ 11 , 13 , 14 ], which is based on the concept of increased work capacity over time [ 15 ] while using a variety of exercise modalities including mono-structural (e.g., running, rowing, etc.), as well as body weight movements (e.g., squats, push-ups, etc.) and weightlifting derivatives (e.g., snatch, shoulder press, deadlift, etc.). Recently, several investigators have examined the effects HIFT-based programs after multiple weeks of training, and have shown significant improvements in maximal oxygen consumption (~12%) [ 11 , 12 ], decreases in body fat (~8%) [ 11 , 16 ], as well as improvements in bone mineral content (~1%) [ 16 ] after 16-weeks of HIFT. In addition investigators have reported higher levels of enjoyment [ 14 , 17 ], between HIFT participants and those engaged in more traditional resistance training programs, as well as a greater sense of community [ 18 , 19 ], which facilitates initiation and adherence to exercise training [ 20 ]. Therefore, we propose the definition of HIFT as a training style [or program] that incorporates a variety of functional movements, performed at high-intensity [relative to an individual’s ability], and designed to improve parameters of general physical fitness (e.g., cardiovascular endurance, strength, body composition, flexibility, etc.) and performance (e.g., agility, speed, power, strength, etc.). Thus, and with this definition in mind, the aims of this paper are to: (1) detail what we believe should constitute HIFT modalities; (2) provide a historical perspective of how HIFT programs have developed over the last decade; (3) provide differentiation between current high-intensity protocols; and (4) examine the application of HIFT training. Considering the limited research in the area, our goal is to provide a “working definition” of this style of training so that researchers around the world can equally refer to the same type of training and continue to study and expand our understanding of HIFT. Even though several reviews of the pertinent literature exist, to our knowledge, this is the first manuscript that provides a working definition of what should constitute a HIFT program. To date, investigators have used several terms to identify this type of training (e.g., high-intensity power training, multimodal high-intensity training, functional high-intensity training, etc.). Therefore, as the training modality continues to gain interest in the scientific community, a formal definition is warranted to better assess and compare the effectiveness, safety, and long-term effects of these training programs in future studies, considering the potential impact on public health outcomes. 2. HIIT vs. HIFT: Key Differences A common misconception about HIFT is that it is synonymous with HIIT. While HIFT and HIIT share some conceptual commonalities, such as the high-intensity nature of the training, there are distinct differences in their methodologies that result in important differences in physiological responses and adaptations. The most important differences are in terms of the use of functional movement patterns and resistance-based exercises, as well as the prescription of rest intervals. Typically, HIIT protocols use modalities that are unimodal in nature (i.e., running, cycling, rowing, etc.), whereas HIFT protocols are defined using multimodal and “functional” exercises. Although there are many definitions and criteria that may be used to describe functional exercises, it has been proposed that functional exercises are those that involve whole body, universal motor recruitment patterns in multiple planes of movement such as squats, deadlifts, cleans, snatches, pull-ups, vertical jumps, and more [ 12 , 14 , 21 ]. In more traditional training, these types of powerlifting, weightlifting, and gymnastics exercises are performed for prescribed sets and repetitions with a long recovery time and are assumed to not result in a significant cardiovascular response with either acute or chronic exercise [ 22 ]. However, when prescribed in a continuous circuit or interval format, and conducted at high intensity, these exercises are potent stimuli for not only improving muscle strength and power, but cardiovascular, aerobic, and anaerobic adaptations as well [ 22 ]. Limited research exists comparing the two training modalities; however, studies using HIFT methods specifically have resulted in significant changes in body composition [ 14 , 23 ], muscle strength and power [ 12 , 24 , 25 ], as well as aerobic capacity [ 11 , 12 , 26 ]. Recently, Buckley et al. [ 27 ] compared the training response of multimodal-based HIIT (similar to HIFT; MM-HIIT) with those of unimodal-based HIIT (rowing ergometer; Row-HIIT) in women. Both groups completed six weeks of training three times per week and each protocol included six-rounds of one-minute intervals completed in an “all-out” manner, with a three-minute passive cooldown between rounds. Whereas the Row-HIIT completed multiple intervals on the rowing ergometer, the MM-HIIT group completed several repetitions of a heavy strength movement (squats, deadlifts, presses, etc.), a moderate load power/accessory movement (lunges, push-ups, ring rows, push presses, etc.), and a metabolic conditioning finisher (box jumps, burpees, ball slams, battle ropes, etc.) during the 60 s work intervals. While both the MM-HIIT and Row-HIIT groups significantly improved aerobic capacity (7% vs. 5%, respectively), and anaerobic power (15% vs. 12%, respectively), after six weeks of training, only the MM-HIIT group improved muscle strength, power, and muscular endurance [ 27 ]. Therefore, it appears that multimodal-based HIIT/HIFT provides similar improvements in aerobic and anaerobic adaptations as more traditional, unimodal HIIT programs, with the added benefit of significant improvements in muscle performance that are not typically observed with either HIIT [ 27 ] or continuous [ 28 ] aerobic training. The second major difference between HIFT protocols and more traditional HIIT protocols is the exclusion of a defined rest interval. Many HIFT workouts are based on completing a certain number of repetitions in the fastest time possible (i.e., repetitions for time) or on completing a series of exercises within a given time frame for as many repetitions as possible (i.e., As Many Repetitions As Possible; AMRAP). The nature of each HIFT workouts means that individuals will require rest or recovery breaks throughout the workout based on their current fitness levels; therefore, these breaks are often short and not prescribed, thereby taken as in “as needed” basis throughout the exercise bout. This differs from most HIIT protocols in that they often have recovery intervals at specific points in time, which are typically longer. For example, one of the more traditional HIIT protocols is the completion of multiple “all-out” 30 s sprint intervals on a cycle ergometer, repeated every 4.5 min for 4–6 rounds (repeated Wingate training) [ 10 ]. The differences in recovery time during various interval protocols may have important implications for inducing training-related adaptations. For example, Cochran et al. [ 29 ] performed a two-part study where, in the first part, they compared the acute responses of four repeated Wingate tests and a continuous high-intensity bout of equal work (a total of around four-minutes of all-out work on a cycle ergometer). The acute mitochondrial responses were similar between protocols, which may suggest the potential for similar adaptations. However, unlike previous studies where significant improvements in mitochondrial enzymes had been reported after chronic HIIT [ 30 , 31 ], Cochran et al. [ 29 ], in their second study within this paper, studied the chronic adaptations to six weeks of training using only the continuous protocol and reported that this protocol did not induce significant chronic mitochondrial adaptations that are typically observed with HIIT training. Nonetheless, while significant changes in mitochondrial proteins were not present after six weeks of training, the continuous training group showed significant increases in cycling time trial performance and maximal aerobic capacity that are similar in magnitude to previous reports of adaptations to HIIT protocols [ 29 ]. The discordance between the acute and training-related responses to these protocols presents an intriguing aspect of HIFT vs. HIIT training and their relative adaptations that requires more study. Although several studies exist, the magnitude of the literature related to this topic is a scarce. Butcher and colleagues [ 32 ] compared a popular HIFT protocol (AMRAP of 5 pull-ups, 10 push-ups, and 15 body weight squats for 21 min) with a multimodal HIIT protocol (8 bench press, 10 pull-ups, and box jumps for the remainder of a 60 s interval with a 3-min recovery time for 6 sets) and found that while rate of perceived exertion responses were similar between the two-protocols (16 ± 1.8 vs. 18 ± 1.5, p > 0.05), heart rate responses were quite different. Whereas the HIFT protocol resulted in heart rates around 90% of age-predicted maximum throughout the 21-min workout, the average heart rates for the multimodal HIIT protocol were around 76% of age-predicted maximum, with only the peaks for each interval approaching 90% maximum. This suggests that a HIFT program would provide greater physiological stimulus over a 21-min workout than a HIIT protocol of comparable time. In addition, the long-term ability of a participant to maintain such high percentage of maximal heart rate would result in chronic cardiovascular adaptations, which will result in reduction of chronic disease risk factors and mortality risk [ 33 ]. These two points, however, require additional investigation within the HIFT literature. Most recently, Sperlich et al. [ 34 ] compared the psycho-physiological responses associated with a circuit-like, multi-joint, high-intensity program (Circuit HIIT ) compared to a low-intensity high-volume exercise program (Circuit Combined ) among a group of inactive women during nine-weeks. Even though investigators reported improvements in body composition, strength, power, and quality of life in both groups, the Circuit HIIT -based protocol alone resulted in greater increases in aerobic capacity, along with greater perceptions of pain, whereas the Circuit Combined increased perception of general health. Together, these studies suggest that the cardiovascular stress and potential for adaptation may be different between protocols that are continuous compared to those that are interval in nature, regardless of intensity. Kliszczewicz et al. [ 35 ] examined the oxidative stress of a single HIFT session including 20 min of 5-pull-ups, 10 push-ups, and 15 air-squats compared to a high-intensity treadmill session of 20 min of running at 90% maximal heart rate. Even though significant increases in oxidative markers were seen following each of the two exercise bouts, no significant differences were observed between the two modalities. Thus, the investigators concluded that when matched by time and intensity, the 20-min HIFT session, produced a physiological stress response that was similar to treadmill running. More recently, Kliszczewicz et al. [ 36 ] compared the effect of a short (<5 min) and long (15 min) HIFT workout on plasma metabolic markers. Even though significant changes in glucose, insulin, epinephrine and norepinephrine were observed immediately after each HIFT bout, no significant differences were reported between the two HIFT workouts, suggesting that perhaps even less than five-minutes of HIFT may be beneficial for those with glucose metabolism impairment [ 36 ]. Additionally, it is worth nothing that of the four markers presented, only insulin markers remained lower than pre-exercise values 1-h after the completion of the exercise bout. Additional studies should be conducted to elucidate the potential metabolic effects of this type of training modality among those with metabolic impairment. While the evidence presented suggests differences in acute and chronic responses between traditional HIIT and HIFT protocols, the scarce data currently available comparing both training protocols prevents us from providing clear evidence to suggest one training program is superior to the other; however, it seems that HIFT protocols may allow for multiple performance and physiological adaptations that are not observed by solely training using unimodal HIIT methodology. Therefore, practitioners should consider the adaptations desired by their trainees when selecting training methods. 3. Historical Perspective of HIFT Due to the physical demands of various “tactical athlete” populations (e.g., military, fire service, etc.), training needs have changed and adapted over time, with a clear “grass-roots” interest in and demand for improving fitness for job duties, and law enforcement (i.e., combat, fire suppression and rescue) [ 37 ]. For example, there has been a shift to the development and use of both combat readiness tests in the military and physical agility tests used in the fire service and law enforcement, which mimic actual job-related tasks rather than traditional fitness tests, which typically include a run, bodyweight exercises (e.g., sit-ups and push-ups), and a flexibility measure [ 38 ]. Concurrently, various specialized tactical fitness programs for the military, fire service, and law enforcement have been developed [ 21 , 37 ]. In line with the documented abilities required by combat personnel [ 39 ], Batchelor [ 40 ] and Lowman [ 41 ] documented the most important physical tasks involved in combat included lifting from the ground, lifting overhead, pushing, pulling and/or climbing, rotation, jumping and landing, lunging, marching, running, and changing direction. With these needs in mind, Heinrich and colleagues [ 12 ] compared the effects of a traditional military physical training program and a circuit-style HIFT program called Mission Essential Fitness (MEF) among active duty Army personnel. After eight weeks of training, the MEF group significantly increased their strength, aerobic capacity, and flexibility compared to the traditional military physical training group. However, military personnel, firefighters, and law enforcement officers who train to improve their operational readiness and fitness are not training solely to improve aerobic or strength parameters [ 42 ], as the physical demands of their jobs involve a broad range of fitness domains necessary to perform the mission at hand [ 42 ]. Effective fitness programming should address all these critical domains [ 21 , 37 , 43 , 44 ]. Recently, Haddock and colleagues [ 37 ], Poston and colleagues [ 21 ], and with Hodzovic [ 45 ] describe how programs that combine aspects of resistance training with aerobic and bodyweight exercises have excellent potential to improve both anaerobic and aerobic capacity in a more time- and volume-efficient manner than traditional military training. This introduces HIFT as valuable and appropriate training program for military personnel. To our knowledge, the first mention of HIFT as an intervention strategy among non-military personnel was made by Heinrich and colleagues [ 14 ]. In that study, investigators sought to compare markers of enjoyment and adherence between individuals enrolled in a HIFT program and those in a traditional moderate-intensity aerobic and weight training group. After eight weeks of training, those in the HIFT group not only spent significantly less time exercising (only 39 min per week, compared to 189), but they also had higher exercise enjoyment and intentions to continue (100%) than the traditional group (56%). These findings are significant, as they provide evidence that HIFT exercise may be more enjoyable than traditional exercise programs, which could have potential public health implications. Among military populations, such as the US Army, criticisms of the current physical training program exist, including insufficient preparation for combat and lack of training in multiple fitness domains [ 40 ]. Thus, exercise training is often geared toward passing the Army’s fitness test rather than combat preparedness [ 40 ], and this disconnect negatively impacts soldier motivation for the exercise training program. 4. Utilization of HIFT Programs in the General Population The rapid growth in popularity of HIFT has public health implications, considering that less than 21% of United States adults meet current aerobic and muscle-strengthening physical activity guidelines [ 46 ]. Exercise adherence is a key area of focus because many exercise programs have high dropout rates [ 47 ]. Although previous research has addressed exercise adherence in general [ 48 , 49 ], there is a lack of extant information on adherence to high-intensity exercise programs that incorporate both aerobic and muscle-strengthening activities, such as HIFT. As well, limited information is available about key factors that influence initiation of high-intensity exercise in the first place [ 11 ]. It is well established that satisfaction of innate psychological needs (i.e., competence, autonomy, and relatedness) is the product of intrinsically motivated behaviors [ 50 ], whereas extrinsic factors (e.g., external rewards) can undermine intrinsic motivation [ 51 ]. Therefore, intrinsically motivated behaviors are a strong predictor of overall exercise adherence [ 52 ]. As mentioned, Heinrich and colleagues [ 14 ] were the first to use HIFT as an intervention strategy among non-military personnel. In that study, investigators sought to compare markers of enjoyment and adherence between individuals enrolled in a HIFT program and those in a traditional moderate-intensity aerobic and weight training group. After eight weeks of training, those in the HIFT group not only spent less time exercising, but they also had higher exercise enjoyment and intentions to continue than the traditional group. Moreover, Heinrich and associates [ 14 ] postulated that intrinsic motivation facilitated exercise initiation for the participants enrolled in this study. As such, individuals were more likely to be intrinsically motivated to adhere to an activity if they had feelings of high enjoyment, made social connections, and experienced low anxiety about the activity [ 53 ]. Accordingly, HIFT exercise adherence has been positively correlated with enjoyment [ 14 , 19 , 53 ], social support [ 18 , 54 ], and intrinsic motivation [ 14 , 19 ]. Overall, intrinsic motives (e.g., challenge and enjoyment) have been ranked significantly higher by HIFT participants than those completing other types of resistance exercise in a group, alone, or with a personal trainer [ 17 ]. Improving physical abilities (e.g., strength, fitness), health-related factors (e.g., prevention, being/remaining healthy), and functional skills seem to be key participation motives for HIFT participants [ 18 , 19 , 55 ]. Additionally, affiliation, challenge, and enjoyment motives have been rated significantly higher for HIFT participants than those in other types of resistance exercise groups. Conversely, appearance, health pressures, ill-health avoidance, positive health, and weight management were rated significantly lower for HIFT participants (mean age = 30.7 years) than those completing resistance exercise with a personal trainer (mean age = 47.2 years) [ 17 ]. Intrinsic regulation, content of intrinsic goals, and competence need satisfaction have positively predicted HIFT participation frequency, although participation was negatively predicted by external regulation [ 56 ]. More specifically, the basic psychological needs of autonomy, relatedness, and competence have positively predicted regulation of HIFT participation, with those who participated less often reporting lower levels of each [ 19 , 57 ]. However, the frequency of weekly HIFT participation has not been significantly correlated with affect, well-being, or body awareness [ 55 ]. In contrast, Bycura and colleagues [ 19 ] reported factors such as revitalization, enjoyment, affiliation, and competition to be positively correlated with length (i.e., years) and frequency (i.e., weekly) of participation in HIFT programs. They surmised that the social components of HIFT programs, including group exercise, may greatly impact overall adherence and participation [ 19 ]. Using the application of achievement goal theory within a HIFT setting, Partridge, Knapp, & Massengale [ 58 ] found that females and participants with less than six months of experience were significantly more likely to report higher mastery-based goals, while males and those with more experience were significantly more likely to report higher performance-based goals [ 58 ]. These findings suggest that the steep learning curve associated with the different components of constantly varied HIFT workouts may necessitate a focus on mastery goals for females and newer participants [ 58 ]. Awareness of participant goals is useful to help facilitate adherence as well as for linking like-minded participants together. Fitness centers, or gyms, are social institutions that offer opportunities for like-minded individuals to interact outside of the home or work setting, which helps enhance a sense of belongingness [ 59 ]. Among HIFT programs, CrossFit training is the most common, and aims to be more than a fitness program or gym, with an emphasis on community [ 60 ]. The physical layout of HIFT facilities differ from those of traditional gyms in their value of floor space and moveable functional fitness equipment as compared to electronic cardio equipment with television screens and stationary weight machines [ 60 , 61 ]. Within CrossFit gyms, or “boxes” as they are typically called, equipment is minimal and interaction with others is expected and encouraged, as compared to other types of gyms and group fitness classes where people create virtual boundaries by listening to headphones or claiming a physical space for their own [ 60 ]. Indeed, some traditional group fitness classes are a “space where individuals come together to exercise alone in a group setting” [ 62 ]. When HIFT uses the group exercise model and group induction process, greater social capital and community belongingness occur, but it is possible that people more open to social interaction are attracted to HIFT in the first place [ 61 ]. CrossFit training participants establish identity through shared norms, named workouts, attire, and shared language [ 20 , 60 ]. Involvement in CrossFit training is thought to go beyond the gym where through this “reinventive” institution, individuals can better their lives overall–becoming the “best possible versions of themselves” [ 60 ]. Social capital is described as the ability to make connections with others in a social network, where trust, reciprocity and cooperation are paramount [ 63 ]. In this regard, researchers studying the contextual and social environment of HIFT compared to traditional gyms in the UK found that social capital and sense of community were significantly higher among those who participated in HIFT (e.g., CrossFit training) than those who attended traditional gyms [ 61 ]. Moreover, social capital and community belongingness were both positively correlated with weekly gym attendance for each gym type, suggesting that an individual’s ability to make connections and build trust and cooperation with other participants were important factors for maintaining exercise adherence [ 61 ]. However, when trying to determine what factors were most influential in predicting gym attendance, regression analysis showed that social capital, community belongingness and gym type only accounted for 6% of the variance, suggesting that gym attendance was influenced by many factors other than those examined by the authors [ 61 ]. As described by the authors, those in the HIFT group were younger and reported fewer years of membership compared to the traditional gym group, which may be important, considering it is well established that younger individuals are more proactive in building social networks compared to their older counterparts [ 64 ]. Perhaps the nature of HIFT environments provide unique opportunities for participants to build meaningful relationships and social networks (e.g., working out in groups, tracking and sharing workout results, social activities outside the gym, etc.). Recent evidence from Heinrich and colleagues [ 20 ] examined key factors that may affect participation in HIFT from the viewpoint of coaches. Findings suggest that key elements, such as environmental and social factors, along with physical and psychological changes experienced by the participants are thought to influence and promote exercise adherence [ 20 ]. Moreover, a focus on community building, reducing intimidation and cost, goal setting, monitoring progress, and social support were key factors for facilitating participation [ 20 ]. As a form of HIFT, CrossFit training is considered both fitness training and a sport, which allows for the public measurement and recording of workouts [ 65 ]. Performing workouts facilitates “peak experiences of flow”, especially when performed in supportive group settings [ 65 ]. Participants who engage in CrossFit training view the body as a machine through the immersive model of sport (i.e., positive effects from competition with in-group bonding empowering disenfranchised people/groups where gender is on a continuum), which is a healthful practice [ 65 ]. Recently, researchers examined if individuals engaged in CrossFit training might have higher than usual levels of exercise addiction–or obsessive need to complete increasing amounts of exercise despite pain or injury, resulting in negative consequences–which ranges between 3–29% in different types of sports [ 66 ]. The authors concluded that among the 603 participants (55% male) engaged in CrossFit training, younger (<age 30) men with higher exercise training volumes were more likely to experience exercise addiction; however, the overall prevalence of self-reported exercise addiction was 5%, which was similar to other sports [ 66 ]. Those with higher exercise addiction scores were more likely to “exercise despite pain/injury,” feel “guilt when missing exercise,” have “obsessive exercise,” and “take medication to exercise” [ 56 ]. Interestingly, greater “obsessive exercise” was positively associated with having “conflicts with family.” The 5% rate found in the study was slightly lower than previous rates for football [soccer] players (7.1%) and individual fitness participants (9.7%) ages 16–39 [ 66 ]. Another appeal of HIFT also is based on the idea of empowering women in a postfeminist context, including women defeating men in workouts as well as showing strong women accomplishing difficult tasks [ 67 ]. Despite its focus on functional fitness, CrossFit marketing has seemed to focus more on attractive bodies than functional ones–which was in accord with the obsession on femininity in the postfeminist media culture [ 67 ]. It is expensive to participate in CrossFit training at an affiliate and composite media from CrossFit promotes a woman who is “not too old, already or formerly very active, overwhelmingly White, and have access to the resources needed to be successful, especially money, time, and energy” [ 67 ]. However, more recent images have been more inclusive of multiple body types, ages, and health conditions ( www.crossfit.com ). HIFT programming is typically associated with younger healthy individuals, considering the high-intensity nature of the training. In a recent study, Feito and colleagues [ 68 ] examine changes in body composition, bone metabolism, strength, and skill-specific performance over 16- weeks of HIFT among a group of apparently healthy adults. Overall, improvements of body fat percent (−6.5 ± 14.2 %fat) and bone mineral content among women (+0.7 ± 1.9 g/cm 2 ) were observed. The latter finding, although preliminary, considering the cross-sectional nature of the study, might suggest this training modality could have potential osteogenic effects in a relatively faster time period than traditional exercise programs [ 68 ]. Future studies should consider this training modality among populations with impaired bone metabolism (e.g., osteopenia, osteoporosis, etc.). To our knowledge, Heinrich et al. [ 11 ] were the first to report the potential benefits of HIFT among a clinical population. In that study, researcher sought to determine how cancer survivors may benefit from as little as five-weeks of HIFT training. Participants reported significant improvements in emotional functioning, as well as improvements in measured body composition (increased lean mass, decreased fat mass and body fat percentage) and five of seven functional performance tests [ 11 ]. Additionally, cancer survivors who adhered to the program found the HIFT group exercise program to be acceptable and appealing [ 11 ]. Moreover, even though the program was well received by these participants, investigators noted the importance of properly screening and individualizing exercise programs, which allowed for modifications for cancer survivors participating in HIFT and required education and appropriate training for coaches [ 11 ]. More recently, Nieuwoudt et al. [ 69 ] and Fealy et al. [ 70 ] provided insight to the effect of 6-weeks of HIFT on beta-cell function [ 69 ] and insulin resistance [ 70 ] among a group of overweight/obese individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Investigators reported significant improvements in beta-cell function and insulin processing [ 69 ], and insulin sensitivity [ 70 ]. In addition, and similar to other studies with healthy populations, Nieuwoudt and colleagues also reported significant improvements in oxygen capacity (2.43 ± 0.12 vs. 2.81 ± 0.15 L/min pre and post, respectively) and physical performance (223 ± 12 vs. 282 ± 11 repetitions pre and post, respectively) after 6-weeks of training. Perhaps more importantly from a public health perspective, is Fealy et al. significant decrease in metabolic syndrome z-score (6.4 ± 4.5 vs. −0.2 ± 5.2 AU; p < 0.001), suggesting that participants overall significantly improved their overall risk of developing cardiovascular disease and mortality [ 71 ]. Future studies should consider these findings and design-controlled interventions that can elaborate on these findings and evaluate the public health impact of this type of interventions among individuals with multiple risk factors for cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome. The level of experience and training of HIFT coaches was recently investigated by Waryasz et al. [ 72 ] and Maxwell and colleagues [ 73 ]. A survey evaluating CrossFit instructor credentials and exercise programming practices found significant variability in training methods and education/certifications of 193 instructors [ 72 ]. Even though the vast majority of coaches interviewed had a minimum of a bachelor’s degree and had completed a CrossFit Level 1 certification course [ 72 , 73 ], 26% of those interviewed by Maxwell had an associate’s degree or less and 48.8% of those in Waryasz’s study did not have another personal training certification of any type. In addition, large variations were observed in the level of experience reported by Waryasz and colleagues [ 72 ], as the mean years of experience was 8.5 years, with a standard deviation of 8.5 years, which suggest some of those interviewed were recently starting in the field. As such, it has been suggested that some coaches at HIFT facilities may not have the requisite exercise science degree, training, or experience to adequately protect their members from injury risks, particularly those from high repetition high-stress movements [ 74 ]. Exercise modifications may not always be used when needed due to participant ego or lack of coaching knowledge, and high risk/low benefit exercises (e.g., kipping toes-to-bar, single-leg squats) are included in some workouts [ 74 ]. Many benchmark CrossFit workouts contradict physiological training principles and scientific recommendations for developing/enhancing physical fitness via muscular strength and power or plyometric training [ 74 ]. Additionally, Maxwell et al. [ 73 ] reported on the level of sport nutrition knowledge among 289 HIFT trainers and found they had only moderate sport nutrition knowledge, with trainers answering about 65% of questions correctly. Those who answered correctly, were most knowledgeable about energy needs/recovery (75% correct) and micronutrients (70% correct), but less knowledgeable about hydration (55% correct) and macronutrients (50% correct). However, this is not surprising given that the last two components are significantly disputed by CrossFit, Inc. in opposition to current nutritional and hydration guidelines [ 75 , 76 ]. Aside from being utilized in health and fitness settings, HIFT also has been utilized in education facilities. An evaluation of college credit courses for weight training and HIFT found that muscular power, via standing long jump, increased significantly more for traditional weight training students, while HIFT students increased muscular power significantly more than students who completed weight training on their own [ 24 ]. Traditional weight training students also increased upper body power in the YMCA bench press test over those in the HIFT groups and those doing weight training on their own [ 24 ]. However, it is worth pointing out that the HIFT group had the greatest improvement in lower body endurance, as performed in the 1-min squat test. Sibley [ 77 ] provided a template for utilizing HIFT for sport education in a middle or high school in order to “challenge and motivate students to improve their fitness levels” (p. 48), in order to make fitness approachable, realistically challenging, and fun. 5. Application of HIFT with Tactical Athletes Due to the physical demands of various “tactical athlete” populations (e.g., military, fire service, etc.), training needs have changed and adapted over time, with a clear “grass-roots” interest in and demand for improving fitness for job duties, and law enforcement (i.e., combat, fire suppression and rescue) [ 37 ]. For example, there has been a shift to the development and use of both combat readiness tests in the military and physical agility tests used in the fire service and law enforcement, which mimic actual job-related tasks rather than traditional fitness tests, which typically include a run, bodyweight exercises (e.g., sit-ups and push-ups), and a flexibility measure [ 38 ]. Concurrently, various specialized tactical fitness programs for the military, fire service, and law enforcement have been developed [ 21 , 37 ]. In line with the documented abilities required by combat personnel [ 39 ], Batchelor [ 40 ] and Lowman [ 41 ] documented the most important physical tasks involved in combat included lifting from the ground, lifting overhead, pushing, pulling and/or climbing, rotation, jumping and landing, lunging, marching, running, and changing direction. With these needs in mind, Heinrich and colleagues [ 12 ] compared the effects of a traditional military physical training program [Army Physical Fitness Readiness Training (APRT)] and a circuit-style HIFT program [MEF] among active duty Army personnel. Briefly, the APRT is typically carried out 5-days-per-week, and includes exercisses focusing in mobility, strenght, and endurance, including a warm-up, 50-min of exercise including aerobic and resistance training, and a cooldown [ 78 , 79 ]. The MEF program includes a total of 15 different exercises composed of multiple multimodal movements focusing on strength, power, speed, and agility [ 12 ], including Olympic lifts, squats, bench press, and pull-ups, plyometrics, lower body movements (e.g., weighted walking lunges), upper body movements (e.g., band bicep curls), and core exercises (e.g., plank with feet elevated on a medicine ball) perfomed in a circuit-like format of 60–90 s each per station, with little or no rest between stations for 45 min. After eight weeks of training, the MEF group significantly increased their bench press strength (13.2 ± 12.1 versus 2.7 ± 11.5 pounds; p = 0.001), aerobic capacity resulting in improved 2-mile run time (−89.91 ± 70.23 versus −15.33 ± 69.16 s; p = 0.003), and flexibility (0.6 ± 1.3 versus −0.5 ± 1.5 inches; p = 0.003) compared to the traditional APRT group. However, military personnel, firefighters, and law enforcement officers who train to improve their operational readiness and fitness are not training solely to improve aerobic or strength parameters [ 42 ], as the physical demands of their jobs involve a broad range of fitness domains necessary to perform the mission at hand [ 42 ]. Effective fitness programming should address all of these critical domains [ 21 , 37 , 43 , 44 ]. Recently, in their respective reviews, Haddock et al. [ 37 ], and Poston and colleagues [ 21 ] described how programs that combine aspects of resistance training with aerobic and bodyweight exercises have excellent potential to improve both anaerobic and aerobic capacity in a more time- and volume-efficient manner than traditional military training. This introduces HIFT as valuable and appropriate training program for military personnel. Concerns have been raised about the relevance and efficacy of traditional fitness approaches to improve fitness and produce operational readiness among many military, fire service, and law enforcement professionals [ 21 , 37 ]. As noted by Haddock et al. [ 37 ] and Poston et al. [ 21 ] in their respective reviews, there are four specific concerns with traditional fitness programs for these populations. First, it seems that traditional fitness programs are heavily focused on improving aerobic conditioning by emphasizing running medium to long distances, especially for the military. Second, it does not appear that traditional fitness training and/or training programs that emphasize aerobic conditioning provide the fitness capacity relevant for the full spectrum of physical demands of combat, fire suppression and rescue, and law enforcement tasks. Third, traditional fitness training approaches do not take into account the highly variable and unpredictable physical demands required of tactical athletes when engaged in operational situations (i.e., running on a treadmill for an hour does not mimic going into a structure fire while wearing 75 lbs of protective equipment, including a face mask and oxygen tank; nor does it mimic rucking with a 75 lb field pack in a deployed environment or having to rescue carry an injured combatant); and fourth, traditional fitness programming, particularly programs that emphasize high running volumes, result in troubling and high rates of injury [ 21 , 37 , 43 , 80 ], which not only impact the individual, but can also be costly to the entire team. Haddock and colleagues [ 37 ] recently reviewed the application of HIFT approaches to military personnel and the outcomes associated with programs tested by the Canadian Infantry (Combat Fitness Program which was based on CrossFit), the US Army Command and General Staff College (CrossFit), the Naval Health Research Center (Combat Conditioning Trial Program), the United States Air Force (USAF) Combat Controller training program, and the Mission Essential Fitness program tested in US Army troops. The potential benefits of these type of HIFT programs, as identified by the authors, included reduced training volumes and subsequent injury risk, improved fitness across multiple domains (e.g., strength, power, agility, flexibility, both aerobic and anaerobic capacity, and muscle endurance), potential for improved adherence due to the variability in programming, use of more efficient full-body functional movements that may better prepare tactical professionals for real world applications, which could be termed improved general physical preparedness, and reduced body fat/improved body composition [ 37 ]. Additionally, a few years earlier, O’Hara and colleagues [ 81 ] reviewed studies of different HIFT approaches that they termed “Non-traditional Training Modalities”, including CrossFit, Kettlebell Training, lower heavy extremity strength training, and agility training with a focus on their potential to improve physical performance among US Air Force personnel. They concluded that programs that included heavy leg strength training and agility training improved aerobic fitness and fitness test scores (e.g., among Air Force personnel, especially among those having trouble meeting US Air Force fitness requirements); however, further research on these non-traditional training modalities was warranted [ 81 ]. Considering the evidence-based benefits for HIFT programs among military personnel, there is clearly no reason to believe that the benefits would not be applicable to other tactical occupational groups that also have significant physical demands, such as firefighters and law enforcement officers. Several studies have documented the substantial physical and metabolic demands associated with both firefighting and law enforcement and the fact that multiple fitness domains are important for successful performance of job tasks [ 82 , 83 , 84 , 85 , 86 , 87 , 88 , 89 ]. Rhea and associates [ 88 ] demonstrated tests of strength (both upper and lower body and grip), muscular endurance, and anaerobic capacity were tests most strongly associated with simulated firefighting tasks (e.g., hose pull, dummy drag, stair climb, etc.), while aerobic capacity was not a statistically significant correlate with any of the firefighting tasks. Similarly, Michaelides and associates [ 86 , 87 ] reported that muscular endurance, strength, and flexibility were the best predictors of firefighter job task performance. Beck and colleagues [ 84 ] also found that upper body strength and endurance, lower body power, torso endurance, and agility were significantly correlated with performance of law enforcement job tasks (e.g., stair ascent and descent, 159 m run, simulated rescue/arrest, etc.), although they also found aerobic capacity to be a significant correlate. Over the last decade, several investigators have recommended that tactical professionals engage in regular fitness training to improve overall health and job performance in order to reducing injury risks and prevent deaths related to poor fitness [ 90 , 91 , 92 , 93 , 94 , 95 ]. Recommended training typically focuses on multiple fitness domains (e.g., aerobic and anaerobic capacity, strength, power, agility, flexibility, etc.) in recognition of the variety of tasks in which tactical professionals may have to engage (e.g., sprinting after a perpetrator, breaching a door, rescuing and carrying a person to safety, carrying a charged fire hose, etc.). However, intertwining traditional modalities while incorporating functional movements that mimic tactical job tasks and better mimic real world tactical situations, may require performance of activities impacting several fitness domains at the same time [ 91 , 92 , 95 , 96 ]. As noted previously, this notion of bringing together these separate training modalities into a combined training approach is central to the definition of HIFT approaches [ 21 , 45 ]. It is clear that HIFT approaches are applicable to the fitness needs of law enforcement officers and firefighters, similar to those studied for military members, and it is likely they would confer health and job performance benefits. Nonetheless, there is a dearth of well-designed, randomized, longer duration (i.e., four months or longer) general fitness intervention studies, particularly those focused on HIFT, among these tactical occupational groups. 5.1. Firefighter Fitness Studies Abel and colleagues [ 97 ] evaluated the immediate effects of a circuit training workout on aerobic and anaerobic metabolic markers in a sample of 20 career firefighters. They also compared the results of the circuit training workout on the markers with the same outcomes among firefighters who engaged in simulated firefighting and rescue tasks. They reported that post-workout blood lactate levels were similar to those previously measured among firefighters engaging in simulated job tasks, thus concluding that the circuit workout produced a similar anaerobic response to firefighting tasks [ 92 ]. Additionally, Roberts et al. [ 98 ] and Peterson et al. [ 99 ] evaluated the effect of several weeks of training among firefighters. Roberts et al. [ 98 ] conducted a 16-week single group, pre-test, post-test training program that included periodized resistance, aerobic, and functional training with 115 firefighter recruits three days per week for one hour sessions, resulting in significant improvements in aerobic capacity (VO 2max ), upper body muscle endurance (push-ups), and flexibility. Peterson et al. [ 99 ] conducted a 9-week study comparing two fitness interventions, one using traditionally periodized resistance training and the other using an undulating/non-linear approach to programming resistance training among 14 firefighters. Both groups trained three days/week for 1–1.5 h per session. The traditional periodized program resulted in significant improvements in upper and lower body strength and power output, vertical jump height, and performance on tests simulating six firefighting and rescue tasks for both programs; however, the undulating program produced greater improvements in the overall score of the firefighting task performance test [ 99 ]. More recently, Pawlak et al. [ 94 ] evaluated the impact of two fitness interventions over 12 weeks in a sample of 20 career firefighters. Firefighters were assigned to either an unguided control group (no-treatment control) or a supervised and structured (2–3 day/week) scaled circuit training program that included aerobic, strength, and functional training. At the end of the study, firefighters in the supervised circuit training program had a significantly greater proportion who completed simulated firefighting tests. In addition, they experienced significantly greater improvements in body composition. Finally, Griffin and colleagues [ 100 ] examined the benefits of a three days per week functional training fitness program for fire service recruits during the academy and probationary periods on injury reduction in a cohort study of 109 total firefighter recruits. Injuries were ascertained from injury surveillance reports and workers compensation claims for firefighter recruits in years prior to the intervention implementation (2007–2009) and for the year the program was in place (2012). Recruits exposed to the functional fitness training program experienced significantly lower injury rates (11% vs. 54%; p = 0.009) and filed fewer workers compensation claims (13 claims totaling US $ 6679 vs. 55 claims totaling US $ 95,582; p = 0.028) than recruits who were not exposed to the program. 5.2. Law Enforcement Officer Fitness Studies Similar to those studies with firefighters, several investigators have examined the role of less traditional training programs with law enforcement personnel. Crawley and colleagues [ 101 ] evaluated a 16-week multicomponent fitness intervention that included aerobic, plyometric, body weight, and resistance training three days per week in a single group of 68 police academy recruits. At the end of the 16-week program, participants demonstrated significant improvements in agility, core endurance (sit-ups), upper body endurance (push-ups), lower body peak power, and aerobic capacity (800m shuttle run test) when compared to baseline testing. Additionally, Cocke and associates [ 102 ] compared a traditional periodized fitness conditioning program with one that randomly assigned workouts, incorporating both strength and endurance exercises that were spontaneously selected the day of the workout, for 61 male police academy cadets. Workouts were five days per week for approximately 60 min per session over a six-month period. Although it was not clear how the cadets were randomly assigned to each condition, the investigators reported that compared to those in the traditional periodized training program, those in the randomly selected training group had significantly greater improvements on the vertical jump test, peak power output estimated by the vertical jump, and anaerobic capacity, as measured by 300m sprint time [ 102 ]. With respect to within-group changes, those in the randomized fitness program experienced significant changes over time in all 10 fitness test domains, including improvements in body composition, while the traditional training group only experienced significant changes over time in three tests (push-ups, sit-ups, and 300 m sprint time) [ 102 ]. Given that HIFT focuses on producing fitness across a broad range of domains, incorporates training with movements and apparatus typically used by tactical athletes in the field, and can have lower training volumes that traditional fitness approaches, it has been suggested that HIFT programming may be more suitable for tactical athletes who wish to develop fitness across a variety of domains that are critical to meeting the physical demands of their unique occupations [ 21 ]. In other words, while being “fit” in aerobic, muscle endurance, and flexibility domains, as typically viewed by traditional fitness programming, is important for overall health, wellness, and longevity of tactical athletes to also receive training in additional fitness domains as those provided by HIFT, to be successful. Their fitness levels must provide operational readiness and meet the rigorous physical demands of their jobs, which are substantially more than most individuals in the general public. Thus, it is suggested that fitness approaches that may be adequate for the general public are not substantive enough for tactical athletes [ 37 ]. 6. Safety Although it is important to point out that HIFT programing is not injury free, recent studies have provided insight into the prevalence and incidence of injury associated with these training programs. Overall, injury rates are similar, and often even lower, than those typically reported for running or other fitness activities associated with both military physical training or fitness programming commonly endorsed for use by tactical athletes. For example, Poston et al. [ 21 ] examined the available literature reporting injury incidence rates (number of injuries per 1000 h of training) and found the range in injuries related to HIFT programs were between 0.0–3.9 injuries/1000 h of training, which was lower than those reported for running (10.0 injuries/1000 h of running) [ 103 ] and several other activities such as soccer (7.8 injuries/1000 h of training) [ 104 ]. Moreover, these rates of injury were lower than the average incidence of injury among Zumba ® instructors (5.7 injuries/1000 h) as recently reported by Domene and colleagues [ 105 ]. Most recently, amid some controversy [ 106 , 107 ] several new investigations have examined the incidence of injury among individuals engaging in HIFT-based programming, such as CrossFit training. Although methods varied across studies, e.g., one was a 12-week prospective study (2.1 injuries/1000 h of training; [ 108 ]) and two were retrospective studies where participants reported injuries that occurred in the previous six months (2.3 and 1.9 injuries/1000 h of training; [ 109 , 110 ], injury incidence rates were consistent with those previously published and summarized by Poston et al. [ 21 ]. These findings have led other independent reviewers to conclude that the risk of injury for HIFT participants, especially those using CrossFit training as the main methodology, were comparable or lower than rates for other recreational or physical training approaches [ 111 , 112 ]. In fact, it was noted by Jones and colleague [ 80 ] that the best methods for reducing injury risk among military personnel were to reduce overall running volumes, substitute cross-training activities for running, and conduct running groups scaled to individual ability. 7. Conclusions Traditional exercise training programs have helped improve major components of health-related fitness (i.e., aerobic capacity, body composition, strength, etc.). However, considering the number of individuals currently not meeting the physical activity guidelines, it seems that these programs have a lack of appeal, and may not completely address fitness needs. Over the last few years, HIIT has gained significant momentum as a new training modality that seems to provide similar benefits than more traditional training programs, with a lower time commitment. This reduction of time, along with significant improvement in overall fitness, have resulted in HIIT gaining popularity over the last five-years. More recently, a new method to achieve fitness has emerged that encompasses the intensity of HIIT programs, while incorporating functional movements that are easily reproducible, often with very little equipment. Although this type of training has been in practice for several years, limited research exists to demonstrate its effectiveness, amid its popularity. As a result, and with a goal to provide a clear definition of what should be considered a HIFT program, we have provided a working definition based on what other investigators have described in their studies—a training style [or program] that incorporates functional, multimodal movements, performed at relatively high intensity, and designed to improve parameters of general physical fitness and performance. To better understand this training style, we have provided a historical perspective of HIFT programs over time, and a rational regarding why they were originally designed, and how they are different than more traditional HIIT programs, even though they share the high-intensity component. Moreover, we included their application among those in the general population, as well as among tactical athletes. As such, and in contrast with several other investigators who have used the term “extreme conditioning programs” to describe this type of training modality [ 113 , 114 , 115 ], we believe the use of the term we propose herein—high-intensity functional training—is most appropriate and should be considered for future studies investigating this style of training. Considering the growing focus on functional exercises, as well as the public’s interest in these type of training programs, it is important for investigators to examine and compare the effectiveness, safety, and long-term effects of these programs, as they have potential for significant public health impact. At this time, and based on current available evidence, several gaps in the literature exist. For example, further studies are needed that (1) compare HIIT and HIFT protocols (cross-sectionally and longitudinally) to determine differences between the two training modalities; (2) examine physiological responses to different HIFT workouts, as well as potential sex and age-group differences that may results from these training programs; (3) include populations with chronic disease (e.g., obesity, diabetes, heart disease, etc.), which may significantly benefit from some of the observed physiological changes reported in the literature; (4) examine the ability of HIFT programs for combat readiness preparation, compared to traditional military training programs; as well as (5) assess differences between individuals who initiate and continue HIFT participation and those who do not. Even though the appeal of this training modality has increased over the last decade, many questions still remain unanswered and require further study. It is our hope that the evidence provided herein grants other researchers valuable insight into these programs, and our definition is used in future publications to evaluate more effectively the true reach and impact of this type of training over the years to come.

Copy URL Share a link Share on Email Facebook x LinkedIn Reddit Wechat Abstract Abstract Exercise training is a clinically proven, cost-effective, primary intervention that delays and in many cases prevents the health burdens associated with many chronic diseases. However, the precise type and dose of exercise needed to accrue health benefits is a contentious issue with no clear consensus recommendations for the prevention of inactivity-related disorders and chronic diseases. A growing body of evidence demonstrates that high-intensity interval training (HIT) can serve as an effective alternate to traditional endurance-based training, inducing similar or even superior physiological adaptations in healthy individuals and diseased populations, at least when compared on a matched-work basis. While less well studied, low-volume HIT can also stimulate physiological remodelling comparable to moderate-intensity continuous training despite a substantially lower time commitment and reduced total exercise volume. Such findings are important given that ‘lack of time’ remains the most commonly cited barrier to regular exercise participation. Here we review some of the mechanisms responsible for improved skeletal muscle metabolic control and changes in cardiovascular function in response to low-volume HIT. We also consider the limited evidence regarding the potential application of HIT to people with, or at risk for, cardiometabolic disorders including type 2 diabetes. Finally, we provide insight on the utility of low-volume HIT for improving performance in athletes and highlight suggestions for future research.

Effective diet and exercise interventions to improve body composition in obese individuals,['JW Rankin'],2015,"The assumption is that most of the benefits of weight loss are secondary to lower body fat,  but studies that measure body composition provide more powerful evidence for this connection",19,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1559827613507879,"{'Title': 'Effective Diet and Exercise Interventions to Improve Body Composition in Obese Individuals', 'Authors': 'Janet WalbergRankin,PhD', 'Abstract': 'No Abstract Found', 'DOI': 'https://doi.org/10.1177/1559827613507879', 'Keywords': 'No Keywords Found', 'Full Text Content': ""Restricted access Review article First published online October 24, 2013 Effective Diet and Exercise Interventions to Improve Body Composition in Obese Individuals Janet Walberg Rankin , PhD View all authors and affiliations Volume 9 , Issue 1 https://doi.org/10.1177/1559827613507879 Contents Abstract References Get access More Cite article Share options Information, rights and permissions Metrics and citations Abstract Because higher body fat and lower lean mass is associated with excess morbidity and mortality, health care teams need specific science-based recommendations to advise clients on lifestyle approaches to alter body composition. Combining exercise with modest energy restriction is recommended to cause up to 20% more weight and fat loss, improved function, and reduced lean mass loss than modification of diet alone. The optimal diet for developing a leaner body composition is one that is modestly reduced in energy and contains lower fat and higher protein than average. Aerobic exercise alone may cause minimal change in body weight (1%-3%) and fat if greater than 250 min/wk. Higher intensity or duration of exercise can cause more substantial fat loss but may have poor long-term compliance. Resistance exercise boosts lean body mass and improves some health indicators but generally does not cause fat loss. In summary, consumption of a low-fat (20%-25% of energy), moderately high-protein (>1.2 g/kg and up to 20%-25% of energy) diet with modestly reduced energy (500-1000 kcal/d) combined with aerobic (3-5 d/wk, at least 250 min/wk) and resistance exercise (2 d/wk) can improve body composition to reduce clinically relevant risks associated with obesity.

Daly 1 Show authors 7023 Accesses 219 Altmetric 26 Mentions Explore all metrics Abstract Background Very few older adults meet current muscle strengthening exercise guidelines, and several barriers exist to supervised, community-based resistance exercise programs. Older adults therefore require access to feasible resistance exercise modalities that may be performed remotely. This pilot study assessed the feasibility and acceptability of undertaking a four-week home-based resistance ‘exercise snacking’ intervention (performed either once, twice, or thrice daily) when delivered and monitored remotely in older adults. Methods Thirty-eight community-dwelling older adults [mean\u2009±\u2009SD age 69.8\u2009±\u20093.8 y, 63% female] were randomised to complete resistance ‘exercise snacks’ (9-minute sessions) either once ( n =\u20099), twice ( n =\u200910), or thrice ( n =\u20099) daily, or allocated to usual-activity control (n\u2009=\u200910). Exercise adherence and adverse events were assessed using an exercise diary, and acceptability of the intervention was explored using an online questionnaire. Physical function [balance, 5-times sit-to-stand (STS), and 30-second STS tests] was assessed remotely at baseline and follow-up using videoconferencing. Results The intervention was feasible and safe, with 100% participant retention, high adherence (97, 82, and 81% for once, twice, and thrice daily, respectively), and only two adverse events from a total of 1317 ‘exercise snacking’ sessions. The exercise intervention was rated as enjoyable (75% reported their enjoyment as ≥4 on a 5-point Likert scale), easy to perform, and most (82%) planned to continue similar exercise at home. We also found it was feasible to assess measures of physical function via videoconferencing, although effect sizes for 4-week changes in both 5-STS ( d range, 0.4–1.4) and 30-STS ( d range, 0.7–0.9) following the exercise intervention were similar to controls ( d =\u20091.1 and 1.0 for 5-STS and 30-STS, respectively). Conclusions Resistance ‘exercise snacking’ may be a feasible strategy for engaging older adults in home-based resistance exercise when delivered and monitored remotely. The findings of this pilot feasibility trial support the need for longer-term studies in larger cohorts to determine the effectiveness of resistance ‘exercise snacking’ approaches for improving physical function in older adults. Trial registration The trial was retrospectively registered on 10/11/2021 with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR) ( ACTRN12621001538831 ).

Resistance exercise is the most effective countermeasure for age-related neuromuscular impairments. Despite its wide-ranging benefits, only 6% of adults aged 50\u2009years and older meet current resistance (muscle strengthening) exercise guidelines [ 2 ]. This highlights the need to identify more feasible and effective resistance exercise modalities, particularly for older adults. The reason(s) for poor engagement of older adults with resistance exercise are multifactorial, but include a high perceived difficulty, fear of injury, time constraints, and lack of interest or knowledge [ 3 , 4 , 5 ]. There are several barriers to participation in supervised, community-based exercise programs in older adults, including time constraints associated with travel to an exercise facility [ 6 ], lack of transport [ 5 , 7 ], cost [ 8 ], and a dislike of exercise facilities and group activities [ 8 ]. In addition, physical distancing measures associated with the COVID-19 pandemic have also limited engagement in community-based exercise programs, while also presenting challenges for research studies involving supervised in-person exercise sessions and/or physical assessments [ 9 ]. There is a need, therefore, to identify feasible and safe exercise interventions that can be performed remotely by older adults, and to determine the feasibility of remote physical function assessments required to evaluate the effectiveness of such interventions. There has been increased interest in pragmatic and time-efficient exercise modalities (e.g., bodyweight exercise, stair climbing) as potentially more feasible approaches to improving health and fitness [ 10 , 11 ]. Such ‘minimal-dose’ exercise approaches are supported by findings that regular short bouts (even 5\u2009minutes) of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) are associated with decreased mortality [ 12 ]. To date, most studies of pragmatic exercise strategies (sometimes termed ‘exercise snacking’) have focused on exercise for improving cardiorespiratory fitness and/or markers of metabolic health [ 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 ] rather than on enhancing muscle mass, strength, or function [ 17 ]. In one study, ten-minute resistance ‘exercise snacks’ improved 60-second sit-to-stand performance (+\u200931%, with no change for control) when performed unsupervised twice daily for 28 consecutive days in older adults (mean age 70 y) [ 17 ]. Whether there are potential dose-response effects on the feasibility and safety of similar resistance ‘exercise snacking’ approaches in older adults, as well as their acceptability in this population, remains unclear. This 4-week pilot randomised controlled trial aimed to determine, in community-dwelling older adults, the feasibility of undertaking a home-based resistance ‘exercise snacking’ intervention (performed either once, twice, or thrice daily) when delivered and monitored remotely. Secondary aims were to determine, in this population, the: 1) feasibility of performing home-based physical function assessments remotely using videoconferencing, 2) effects of the resistance ‘exercise snacking’ intervention on physical function, and 3) acceptability of the resistance ‘exercise snacking’ intervention when performed remotely within the home environment. Methods Study design and setting This study was a four-arm, pre-post, 4-week pilot feasibility randomised controlled trial that was designed to determine, in community-dwelling older adults, the feasibility and acceptability of undertaking a home-based resistance ‘exercise snacking’ intervention (performed either once, twice, or thrice daily). The study was conducted during November to December 2020 in Melbourne, Australia. The study period occurred shortly after an extended period of lockdown restrictions (including stay at home orders) as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which were in place in Melbourne, Australia between July 8th and October 28th, 2020. All study procedures, including the recruitment and screening of participants, completion of physical function assessments, and the delivery and monitoring of the exercise intervention, were performed remotely without any in-person contact between participants and the research team. Ethics approval was obtained from the Deakin University Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC 2020–011) and all participants provided written informed consent. The trial was retrospectively registered on 10/11/2021 with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR) (ACTRN12621001538831). Participants and recruitment A total of 38 community-dwelling older adults (convenience sample) aged 65–80\u2009years were recruited (during November 2020) via email addresses listed in a database of participants from previous exercise intervention trials conducted within the Institute for Physical Activity and Nutrition (IPAN) who provided consent to be re-contacted for future trials. Participants were deemed eligible to participate if they were: 1) English-speaking, 2) non-smoking, 3) able to walk unaided or with minimal assistance for ≥50\u2009m, 4) cognitively intact as indicated by a score of ≤2 on the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire (SPMSQ), and 5) had access to a computer, smart phone or tablet device with a stable network or internet/WiFi connection. Participants were excluded based on the following criteria: 1) participating in structured resistance training more than once per week in the previous 3 months, 2) acute or terminal illness likely to impact study involvement, 3) unstable or ongoing cardiovascular, metabolic, or respiratory disorders, 4) current use of insulin or corticosteroids that could influence skeletal muscle metabolism, 5) self-reported body mass index (BMI) ≥40\u2009kg·m −\u20092 , 6) musculoskeletal or neurological disorders impacting voluntary movement, or 7) inability to commit to the study and its requirements. The risk of participants experiencing an adverse event during exercise was determined using the Exercise and Sports Science Australia (ESSA) Adult Pre-exercise Screening System (APSS) [ 18 ]. Participants with signs or symptoms of unstable or unmanaged disease (i.e., if participants answered ‘yes’ to any of the Stage 1 questions of the ESSA APSS) were excluded. All participant screening procedures were completed over the telephone, which included gathering responses to the SPMSQ and APSS questionnaires. A total of 54 older adults were screened for the study, of which 38 were included. Reasons for exclusion ( n =\u200916) are shown in Fig. 1 . After screening for eligibility and baseline testing, participants were randomised, stratified by gender, to one of three exercise groups (once-daily group, n =\u20099; twice-daily group, n =\u200910; thrice-daily group, n =\u20099), or a usual-activity control ( n =\u200910). Group randomisation was computer-generated (using Microsoft Excel) by an independent person not directly involved in the study. Fig. 1 CONSORT diagram Full size image Exercise intervention The exercise intervention involved home-based resistance ‘exercise snacking’ sessions performed either once, twice, or thrice daily for 4 weeks. The exercise program was designed to be pragmatic and time-efficient by: a) focusing on multi-joint exercises involving larger muscle groups; b) targeting improvements in strength (and elements of balance) in lower body muscles most susceptible to age-related declines in muscle mass and strength [ 19 ] c) including exercises requiring minimal equipment (i.e., no more than a chair or a step) and no external loading (i.e., bodyweight only), and d) using a time-based prescription that did not require participants to monitor repetitions or sets and allowed the level of effort during each set to be self-regulated. Each resistance ‘exercise snacking’ session consisted of five exercises that were each performed continuously for 1 min, with 1 min of passive recovery between exercises (total time commitment of 9 min per session). For weeks 1–2, the prescribed exercises were: 1) chair sit-to-stand (no arms), 2) single-leg quarter squat (with chair support), 3) side lunges, 4) calf raise (with chair support), and 5) clock stepping (with chair support). For the clock stepping exercise, participants were instructed to imagine they are standing in the middle of a clock face, and while standing on one leg, to step the other leg forward to the 12 o’clock position and then back to the centre, before repeating this to either the 3 o’clock or 9 o’clock position (for stepping with the right or left leg, respectively) followed by the 6 o’clock position. To provide variety and progressive overload, the five exercises prescribed for weeks 3–4 were changed to: 1) squat into high knee march (knee to elbow), 2) single-leg quarter squat, 3) rapid step ups (involving a rapid concentric phase and performed using a staircase step, or another available step of a similar height), 4) single-leg calf raise, and 5) rapid clock stepping. For unilateral exercises (apart from the squat into high knee march and rapid step ups, both of which were performed in an alternating pattern), one leg was exercised for the first 30\u2009seconds of the one-minute period, before switching to the alternate leg for the final 30\u2009seconds. Participants were instructed to perform as many repetitions as possible in 1 min with appropriate technique for each exercise, and were encouraged to gradually increase both the number and speed of repetitions performed (with appropriate technique) during the intervention. Participants were not asked to record the number of repetitions performed for each exercise during each session, or to perform each ‘exercise snack’ at specific times during the day – rather they were asked to perform each session when convenient and to distribute multiple sessions (where relevant) throughout the day as much as possible. The exercise intervention was remotely delivered via a commercially available, web-based exercise programming application (PhysiTrack™) and accompanying end-user application (PhysiApp™) accessible via a computer, smart phone, or tablet. The PhysiTrack™ application was used only to deliver instructions regarding the exercise intervention (including written instructions and video-based demonstrations for each exercise) to participants, and not for monitoring purposes. Rather, immediately after completing each resistance ‘exercise snacking’ session, participants recorded in an exercise diary (designed in Microsoft Word) whether they successfully completed the session (yes or no), their RPE (Rating of Perceived Exertion) using the CR-10 scale [ 20 ], and whether any adverse events or incidents were experienced. After the first week of the intervention, participants were asked to return the completed exercise diary to the research team via email at the beginning of each subsequent week. Participants attended two (one each at baseline and follow-up) live videoconference meetings (conducted via Zoom) with the same member of the research team. At the first meeting, participants completed all baseline assessments, were shown how to access the exercise program and video demonstrations using PhysiApp™, and how to complete the exercise diary (including explanation of the RPE CR-10 scale). The researcher also demonstrated each exercise and ensured participants could perform each exercise with appropriate technique. Participants also received a weekly email from the research team reminding them to return their completed exercise diary for the previous week. In the week following completion of the intervention, a second live videoconference meeting was held during which follow-up assessments were performed. Feasibility of the exercise intervention Feasibility of the exercise intervention was considered based on participant retention within the study and adherence to the intervention. Participant retention was recorded as the number (proportion) of participants who were randomised and completed both the four-week exercise intervention (or control period) and follow-up assessments. Adherence to the exercise intervention was considered as the number of sessions completed as a proportion of the number of planned (prescribed) sessions. In addition, exercise adherence was also reported as the prescribed versus actual (completed): i) number of days exercised per week, ii) total number (frequency) of ‘exercise snacks’ per week, and iii) total number of ‘exercise snacks’ during the four-week intervention. The exercise intervention was considered feasible if participant retention was at least 90%, and if participants completed a mean of 80% of prescribed sessions. Feasibility of remote physical function assessments We also explored whether it was feasible for participants to perform home-based physical function assessments remotely using videoconferencing. This was assessed as the proportion of participants who could successfully complete all physical function assessments during both the baseline and follow-up videoconferencing meetings. In addition, the feasibility of the remote home-based physical function assessments was considered based on the occurrence of barriers regarding equipment availability [e.g., lack of a suitable chair for sit-to-stand (STS) assessments], technical issues (e.g., unstable internet connection), and the availability of sufficient space within the home environment to complete each test and achieve the camera angles necessary for test scoring (e.g., view of the participant’s feet and/or eyes for balance testing). Adverse events and incidents An adverse event was defined as an intervention-related event resulting in absence from, or modification to, the exercise intervention. An adverse incident was defined as a minor intervention-related event (such as muscle or joint soreness/stiffness) not requiring absence from, or modification to, the exercise intervention. Any reported adverse events or incidents were followed up by research staff who contacted participants via phone to obtain further information and to advise whether participants should continue (with any modifications as required) or cease the exercise program and seek medical advice. Anthropometry and physical function assessments Participants self-reported their height and body mass to the nearest 1\u2009cm and 1\u2009kg, respectively. Physical function was assessed using a standing balance testing battery, the five-times STS (5-STS) test, and the 30-second STS (30-STS) test. For all physical function tests, participants wore comfortable shoes or were barefoot, which was noted during baseline assessments and repeated at follow-up. The time-of-day at which physical function testing was performed was not controlled, but testing was conducted at a similar time-of-day at baseline and follow-up for each participant where possible. Participants ability to maintain balance in three different stance positions (side-by-side, semi-tandem, and tandem) was assessed in accordance with the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) protocol [ 21 ]. The ability to maintain balance in the tandem stance position with the eyes closed was also assessed. Participants were asked to stand with their feet in full view of the camera (either on a smartphone, tablet, or webcam) and position themselves close to a wall or bench to provide support if needed. After assuming the correct stance position, participants were instructed they may use their arms, bend their knees, or move their body to maintain their balance, but to not move their feet. Participants scored 1 point for each test in which balance was maintained for 10\u2009seconds, and zero if balance was not maintained (for a maximum total score of 4 points). Where balance could not be maintained for a given test, participants did not perform any further balance tests. For the 5-STS and 30-STS tests, participants were asked to use a chair that: a) had a firm seat and backrest, b) had no arm rests or wheels, and c) was at a height such that participants could place their feet flat on the floor while their upper body was in contact with the backrest. The same chair was used by each participant for both baseline and follow-up assessments. Before commencement of STS testing, participants were asked to position their chair side-on to the camera, and to adjust their camera so that their entire body was visible to the researcher when seated on the chair. If space limitations did not permit their entire body being visible on camera, the position of the chair and/or camera were adjusted so that at a minimum, the seat and backrest were within camera view. For the 5-STS test, participants began from a seated position in the chair, with their arms folded across the chest, and were instructed to stand fully upright and then return to the seated position five times as quickly as possible. The final score was recorded as the time taken to perform five STS repetitions from initially leaving the chair to being seated after the fifth repetition. The 30-STS test was then performed after a 5-minute recovery following completion of the 5-STS. For the 30-STS test, participants performed repeated chair stands in a manner identical to the 5-STS test; however, they were instructed to instead complete as many repetitions as possible in 30\u2009seconds. The final score was recorded as the number of complete sit-to-stands (defined as standing in a fully upright position) achieved in 30\u2009seconds. Participants were unable to view the 30-second timer during the test and were not provided with any feedback other than when to start and stop the test. Acceptability of the exercise intervention Upon trial completion, process measures were collected (via Qualtrics software) using an author-derived questionnaire completed by participants to evaluate their experiences with, and perceptions about, the exercise intervention. Participants were asked to rate their level of enjoyment of the resistance ‘exercise snacking’ program on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = ‘not at all’, 2\u2009=\u2009‘a little’, 3 = ‘a moderate amount’, 4\u2009=\u2009‘a lot’, and 5 = ‘a great deal’), and if they planned to continue undertaking some form of resistance ‘exercise snacking’ exercise at home. Participants were also asked open-ended questions about what they liked and disliked about the resistance ‘exercise snacking’ program. In addition, if participants indicated they did not plan to continue performing similar exercises after completion of the intervention, they were asked to explain why this was the case, and to describe anything that could be modified about the exercise program to improve the likelihood they would continue performing a similar program at home. All open-ended questions were analysed (within the intervention groups) by researcher(s) (JF) in Microsoft Excel using a general inductive thematic approach [ 22 ]. Statistical analysis As this was a pilot feasibility study [ 23 ], a convenience sample of 38 older adults was recruited and no sample size calculations were performed [ 24 ]. All baseline and follow-up data are presented as means ± SDs and all change data are reported as means with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) unless otherwise stated. Data relating to the feasibility of the intervention (i.e., participant retention and intervention adherence) was considered as descriptive in nature. Exploratory analysis was undertaken to evaluate within-group changes in 5-STS and 30-STS test performance using paired samples t- tests. Effect sizes (Cohen’s d ) for within-group changes between baseline and week 4 were calculated according to the following formula: mean follow-up score minus mean baseline score divided by baseline standard deviation, and interpreted as <\u20090.2\u2009=\u2009trivial, 0.2 to <\u20090.5\u2009=\u2009small, 0.5 to <\u20090.8\u2009=\u2009moderate, and\u2009≥\u20090.8\u2009=\u2009large [ 25 ]. Mean changes, ES values, and associated 95% CIs were calculated using JASP software (Version 0.14.1, JASP Team, The Netherlands). Results Baseline characteristics A summary of participant characteristics for each intervention and control group at baseline is shown in Table 1 . Table 1 Baseline participant characteristics Full size table Feasibility of the exercise intervention As shown in Fig. 1 , participant retention was 100% in all intervention groups and controls. Mean adherence to the exercise intervention for all exercise groups combined was 87%\u2009±\u200920%, which was similar between the three exercise groups [mean (95% CI): once-daily, 97% (95, 100); twice-daily, 82% (63, 101); thrice-daily, 81% (68, 94)]. Additional adherence data summarising the prescribed versus actual (completed) for i) number of days exercised per week, ii) number (frequency) of ‘exercise snacks’ sessions per week, and iii) total number of ‘exercise snacks’ over the 4-week intervention is shown in Table 2 . Table 2 Adherence to the resistance ‘exercise snacking’ intervention presented as the prescribed versus actual (completed) for: i) number of days exercised per week, ii) number (frequency) of ‘exercise snacks’ per week, and iii) total number of ‘exercise snacks’ (both per participant and for all participants combined) during the four-week intervention Full size table Feasibility of remote physical function assessments All 38 participants were able to successfully complete all physical function assessments (balance testing battery, 5-STS, and 30-STS) within their homes during the live videoconference meetings with the research staff at both baseline and follow-up. Adverse events and incidents Two participants (2/28 or 7%) allocated to the exercise groups each reported a single adverse event during the intervention, which included one occurrence of plantar fasciitis and one occurrence of lower back and leg pain associated with a spinal nerve/disc injury. In both cases, these reported adverse events were sufficiently minor to allow participants to continue the intervention with some minor exercise modifications (e.g., limiting range-of-motion and/or completing fewer repetitions in certain exercises, or avoiding unilateral exercises on the affected side) as required. Seven participants (7/28 or 25%) allocated to the exercise groups reported a total of eight minor adverse incidents during the intervention, each of which involved minor musculoskeletal complaints such as muscle (thigh or calf) or joint (knee or ankle) stiffness and/or soreness that did not affect their participation. Rating of perceived exertion (RPE) responses to exercise Average (95% CI) RPE (CR-10 scale) during the intervention was similar between the once-daily [4.0 (3.2. 4.8)], twice-daily [2.7 (1,7, 3.7)], and thrice-daily [3.4 (2.7, 4.1)] groups. Physical function outcomes With the exception of the once daily exercise group, effect sizes for improvements in 5-STS time after 4\u2009weeks were similar ( d range, 1.1–1.4) for the twice and thrice daily exercise groups and controls (Table 3 ). Effect sizes for changes in 30-s STS performance after 4-weeks were also similar ( d range, 0.7–1.0) for all exercise groups and controls (Table 3 ). For balance, 50 to 78% of participants within each group reported no changes after 4\u2009weeks (Table 4 ). Table 3 Baseline and 4-week results for the 5 times sit-to-stand (5-STS) and 30-second STS test and the within-group changes relative to baseline and effect sizes (Cohen’s d ) for each of the groups Full size table Table 4 Baseline and follow-up scores for the balance test and the number and proportion of participants that experienced an increase, no change, or a decrease in their balance score after 4\u2009weeks Full size table Acceptability of the intervention Seventy-five percent (21/28) of participants allocated to the exercise groups rated their level of enjoyment to the exercise program as either “a great deal” or “a lot” (39%, “a great deal”; 36%, “a lot”; 18%, “a moderate amount”; 4%, “a little”; 0%, “not at all”). Seventy-nine percent (22/28) of participants indicated they would continue performing similar resistance ‘exercise snacking’ at home following the intervention. With regards to acceptability of the intervention, a number of key themes were identified and are summarised (with representative quotes) in Table 5 . Participants favoured the brief and frequent nature of the exercise sessions, which allowed integration of the exercise session(s) into their day without interfering with their daily routine. Participants also noted the exercises were relatively easy (particularly in the first 2\u2009weeks of the program) and required minimal equipment to perform, both of which improved the feasibility of the program and had positive implications for improved exercise self-efficacy. There were also indications participants appreciated that the program, despite being brief, addressed important aspects of their health. The responses from some participants suggested future interventions would benefit from individualising exercises selection to suit both technical competency and personal preferences. For example, some participants found the exercise progression between weeks 1–2 and weeks 3–4 of the intervention to be too challenging, while others noted they would have preferred additional exercise variety, the inclusion of upper-body exercises, and incorporating external loads (weights) into the exercises. Table 5 Examples of key response themes and example quotes from participants related to the acceptability of the intervention Full size table Discussion The findings of this pilot randomised controlled trial suggest a pragmatic resistance ‘exercise snacking’ intervention is feasible when performed by community-dwelling older adults in their homes either once, twice, or thrice daily for 4 weeks, and when delivered and monitored entirely remotely. The feasibility of the exercise intervention was evidenced by the 100% participant retention and high adherence to the intervention (87% overall). The intervention was also safe, with only two adverse events occurring from a total of 1317 completed resistance ‘exercise snacking’ sessions over the 4-week period. All participants successfully completed all remote physical function assessments at both baseline and follow-up, suggesting it was feasible for older adults to perform these assessments within their home environment using videoconferencing. Exploratory analysis suggested there was little evidence the intervention was effective for improving measures of physical function, although these findings should be considered in context of the short-term nature of this trial and the small convenience sample size. Finally, participants overall found undertaking the home-based exercise intervention to be acceptable, with most (82%) indicating they would continue performing similar exercise at home after completing the intervention. Consistent with our findings regarding the feasibility and safety of home-based and unsupervised resistance ‘exercise snacking’, a previous study in which older adults underwent a similar home-based and unsupervised exercise protocol twice-daily for 4 weeks reported 98% adherence to the intervention and no adverse events [ 17 ]. This adherence rate was higher than the mean adherence (87%) for all exercise frequency groups in the present study, which may be attributed to the higher frequencies used in the thrice daily group, in which mean adherence was 81% (although between-group differences in adherence were not statistically significant). The present findings nevertheless highlight it is possible for older adults to adhere to either once, twice or thrice daily bouts of exercise for 4 weeks. In addition, we found it was feasible for community-dwelling older adults to complete physical function assessments remotely within their homes using videoconferencing. All 38 participants in this study successfully completed all physical function assessments remotely at both baseline and follow-up, and there were no reported issues with potential barriers such as the availability of equipment (e.g., appropriate chair for STS testing), having sufficient physical space within the home environment to perform the tests, or technical issues with the videoconferencing technology (i.e., Zoom). Although further validation work is needed in larger populations of older adults, these findings are supported by recent observations [ 9 ] that various physical function assessments (including the 5-STS and 30-STS tests) are both valid and reliable (ICC >\u20090.70) when conducted remotely compared to when performed face-to-face. Together these findings have promising implications for monitoring the effectiveness of remotely delivered exercise programs aimed at improving physical function in older adults. The positive findings regarding the feasibility of the intervention should also be considered in context of the manner in which the intervention was monitored remotely, which has potential implications for the broader feasibility and scalability of this pragmatic exercise approach. While the PhysiTrack™ application (and associated end-user application PhysiApp™) was used to deliver instructions regarding the exercise intervention to participants, intervention adherence, RPE, or adverse events were instead monitored using a custom exercise diary. This monitoring was also undertaken relatively infrequently (i.e., only once per week), and researchers did not receive any real-time information or notifications on factors related to the monitoring of the intervention. Given the pragmatic nature of the exercises within the intervention, we believe it is possible that older adults could successfully perform these exercises in the absence of video-based demonstrations (as were provided via PhysiApp™). The exercise program may therefore be feasible for individuals or clinicians who are without access to similar exercise prescription software. Although the intervention was monitored asynchronously and relatively infrequently, it is possible that removing or reducing the frequency of monitoring could have negatively influenced adherence to the intervention. However, considering both the safety of the intervention and its pragmatic nature, it is possible that exercise adherence may have remained high even if monitoring was less frequent or absent, given that participants successfully completed the program unsupervised and without receiving any feedback during the program (e.g., on exercise technique or progression). Taken together, the simple and infrequent manner in which the intervention was delivered and monitored (and the associated low time burden for health professionals) has positive implications for the broader feasibility of similar remote exercise interventions in older adults and their potential to be rolled out at scale. While the initial evidence seems positive, future implementation trials are required to determine the feasibility of similar remote exercise interventions in clinical settings when administered by health professionals. The qualitative analyses in this study revealed important insights regarding the acceptability of the resistance ‘exercise snacking’ program to participants, which may have implications for the long-term feasibility of this novel exercise approach. There were indications that the pragmatic characteristics of the exercise intervention, including that it was time-efficient and incorporated exercises that were simple and required minimal equipment, were particularly appreciated by participants. These factors allowed participants to feasibly integrate the exercise sessions into their day, even when the program was performed on multiple occasions (i.e., up to three times daily). This is supported by the observation that adherence to the program remained high for all daily exercise frequencies, although mean adherence was 16–17% lower in those assigned to twice- or thrice-daily exercise compared to once-daily exercise snacking sessions. Participants also felt that, despite its pragmatic nature, the exercise program addressed important aspects of their health (e.g., improvements in muscle strength and balance). Further, the exercise program appeared to promote greater self-efficacy with exercise, with some participants suggesting the exercise program highlighted they were capable of more exercise than they previously believed. When asked if anything could be modified about the exercise program to improve the likelihood that they would continue performing similar exercise at home, some responses from participants highlighted the potential need to individualise exercise selection to suit both differences in technical ability and personal preferences. While the exercise modifications introduced in weeks 3–4 of the intervention were aimed at providing additional variety and progressive overload, some participants highlighted they found some of the new exercises difficult to perform. It was also clear that future ‘exercise snacking’ interventions could be further improved by providing additional exercise variety (even if the technical demands remain similar), which may be more prudent given the high-frequency – and therefore potentially repetitive – nature of an ‘exercise snacking’ approach, in addition to the inclusion of upper-body exercises. Some participants also expressed the desire to include external loading (i.e., weights) into the program, suggesting a need for future studies to explore potential solutions that are feasible within the home environment (e.g., use of resistance bands, small portable weights, or household items). Taken together, these insights support the notion that ‘exercise snacking’ is a feasible and acceptable resistance exercise modality when performed remotely by community-dwelling older adults. While our findings in this regard were overall positive, it should be considered that the acceptability of the exercise intervention to participants may have been influenced by, and should be interpreted in the context of, their previous experiences in participating in exercise-related studies. Given COVID-19 restrictions (including ‘stay at home’ orders) had only recently been lifted when the study period began, it also remains possible that participants may have continued to spend additional time within their home environment during the time in which the study was conducted, which may have positively influenced the feasibility and/or acceptability of the home-based program. While this short-term pilot trial was not designed nor adequately powered to detect between-group differences in measures of physical function, the modest changes in 5-STS and 30-STS performance (but not balance) at follow-up appeared to be similar across all three intervention groups and controls. Although physical function assessments performed remotely via videoconferencing show acceptable validity and reliability when compared to face-to-face assessments [ 9 ], the similar changes in 5-STS and 30-STS test performance in both the intervention and control groups may be explained by learning effects, particularly given the lack of test familiarisation, which may have reduced the sensitivity of these measures for detecting changes in physical function over time. While the short-term duration of the exercise intervention also likely influenced the magnitude of any changes (or between group differences) in physical function, previous findings suggest similar pragmatic and unsupervised resistance exercise approaches can be effective for improving measures of physical function (e.g., 60-second sit-to-stand performance) after 4 weeks [ 17 ]. Nevertheless, our findings are consistent with another study [ 26 ] that also showed no difference in changes in physical function measures assessed remotely using videoconferencing after 4 weeks of twice-daily ‘exercise snacking’ versus controls. Longer-term studies in larger cohorts are therefore needed to confirm these preliminary findings and determine whether similar resistance ‘exercise snacking’ approaches, and potentially those incorporating additional exercise variety, both upper- and lower-body exercises, and external resistance (e.g., via resistance bands and/or small weights), are effective for improving physical function in older adults. Limitations The limitations of this study must be considered when interpreting the findings. As all physical function assessments were conducted remotely, this may have influenced the validity and/or the reliability of these assessments and consequently the changes in physical function observed in this study. Given study participants had previously participated in exercise intervention trials, this suggests they were both a relatively healthy and physically active cohort, which may have influenced the magnitude of physical function changes from baseline. In support of this, only 32% of participants had baseline 5-STS scores greater than 15\u2009seconds, which is a cut-point used to indicate low muscle strength according to the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP2) consensus guidelines [ 27 ]. Given their history of participation in exercise intervention trials, this may have positively influenced the feasibility and/or acceptability of participants undertaking the home-based intervention when delivered and monitored remotely, and the feasibility of performing home-based physical function assessments remotely using videoconferencing. It is therefore unclear whether the remote exercise intervention and/or physical function assessments may be similarly feasible or acceptable in older adults without a similar history of participation in exercise-related studies. Recruitment from this cohort also cannot inform the feasibility of recruitment from the general population for a larger implementation and/or effectiveness trial. Finally, given all study participants were required to have sufficient digital literacy and access to a stable internet/WiFi connection to be included in the study, this may limit the generalisability of the findings to the broader population. Despite these limitations, the positive findings on the adherence to, and acceptability of, the exercise intervention suggests resistance ‘exercise snacking’ may be a promising approach for engaging older adults with resistance-type exercise. Conclusions This pilot randomised controlled trial suggests a remotely delivered and monitored pragmatic resistance ‘exercise snacking’ intervention is acceptable and can be safely and feasibly performed by community-dwelling older adults within their homes either once, twice, or thrice daily for 4 weeks. However, further longer-term studies in larger cohorts are required to determine the effectiveness of home-based pragmatic resistance ‘exercise snacking’ approaches for improving physical function in older adults when delivered and monitored remotely.

Maintaining or increasing participation in physical activity during older age can prevent some of the age-related declines in physical functioning that contribute to loss of independence and low reported quality of life. Exercise snacking may overcome some commonly cited barriers to exercise and encourage older adults to engage in muscle strength and balance activity, but the best way to deliver and support this novel format remains unknown. Objective: Our aim was to explore how the novel exercise snacking approach, that is, incorporating short bouts of strength and balance activities into everyday routines, could be supported by technology within a home setting and what types of technologies would be acceptable for older adults who are prefrail. Methods: Following a user-centered design process, 2 design workshops (study 1) were conducted first to understand older adults’ (n=11; aged 69-89 years) attitudes toward technology aimed at supporting exercise snacking at home and to inform the design of 2 prototypes. Next, based on the findings of study 1, an exploratory pilot study (study 2) was conducted over 1 day with 2 prototypes (n=5; aged 69-80 years) at the participants’ homes. Participants were interviewed over the telephone afterward about their experience. Transcripts were analyzed using framework analysis. Results: The results showed that the participants were positive toward using technology at home to support exercise snacking, but both exercises and technology would need to be simple and match the participants’ everyday routines. Workshop discussions (study 1) led to the design of 2 prototypes using a pressure mat to support resistance and balance exercises. The exploratory pilot study (study 2) participants reported the potential in using smart devices to support exercise snacking, but the design of the initial prototypes influenced the participants’ attitudes toward them. It also hampered the acceptability of these initial versions and highlighted the challenges in fitting exercise snacking into everyday life. Conclusions: Older adults were positive about using technology in their homes to support strength and balance exercise snacking. However, although promising, the initial prototypes require further refinement and optimization before feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy testing. Technologies to support exercise snacking need to be adaptable and personalized to individuals, to ensure that users are snacking on balance and strengthening exercises that are appropriate for them.

Health benefits of physical activity: the evidence. CMAJ  2006 Mar 14;174(6):801-809  [ FREE Full text ] [ CrossRef ] [ Medline ] 1 ]. Within the United Kingdom, older adults (aged ≥65 years) should accumulate 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity aerobic activity [ Physical activity guidelines: UK chief medical officers' report.

Furthermore, the guidelines highlight that any level of PA should be encouraged, and activities to improve or maintain muscle strength and flexibility should be incorporated at least 2 days per week [ Physical activity guidelines: UK chief medical officers' report. Department of Health and Social Care.  2019 Sep 07.  \n                        \xa0 URL: https:/\u200b/www.\u200bgov.uk/\u200bgovernment/\u200bpublications/\u200bphysical-activity-guidelines-uk-chief-medical-officers-report [accessed 2023-05-04] 2 ]. However, many older adults are failing to meet these guidelines and report low levels of muscle and bone strengthening activities [ Keadle SK, McKinnon R, Graubard BI, Troiano RP.

Recent studies have also indicated that older adults spend a high proportion of their day engaged in sedentary behaviors [ Giné-Garriga M, Sansano-Nadal O, Tully MA, Caserotti P, Coll-Planas L, Rothenbacher D,  et al.

Qual Life Res  2017 May;26(5):1315-1326. [ CrossRef ] [ Medline ] 10 ]. To promote and sustain participation in strength and balance exercise as individuals age, there is a need to develop interventions for this population that are effective, inclusive, acceptable, and safe [ Zubala A, MacGillivray S, Frost H, Kroll T, Skelton DA, Gavine A,  et al.

PLoS One  2017 Jul 10;12(7):e0180902  [ FREE Full text ] [ CrossRef ] [ Medline ] 11 ]. Furthermore, interventions should enable older adults to overcome some of the commonly cited barriers to current participation in PA. Such barriers include dislike for activities that are structured or sport based, time commitments, and limited access to facilities [ Chao D, Foy CG, Farmer D. Exercise adherence among older adults: challenges and strategies. Control Clin Trials  2000 Oct;21(5 Suppl):212S-217S. [ CrossRef ] [ Medline ] 12 - Schutzer KA, Graves BS.

Integration of functional exercise into daily routines may provide another alternative to PA promotion in this population and overcome the recognized barriers in relation to structured exercise programs [ Weber M, Belala N, Clemson L, Boulton E, Hawley-Hague H, Becker C,  et al.

It is similar to Snacktivity [ Gokal K, Amos-Hirst R, Moakes CA, Sanders JP, Esliger DW, Sherar LB,  et al.

Both promote opportunities to engage in exercises that are safe and compatible with individuals’ surroundings and lifestyle [ Perkin OJ, McGuigan PM, Stokes KA. Exercise snacking to improve muscle function in healthy older adults: a pilot study. J Aging Res  2019 Oct 03;2019:7516939  [ FREE Full text ] [ CrossRef ] [ Medline ] 16 ]. So far, exercise snacking has been shown to be an accessible, acceptable, and effective alternative to traditional exercise in older adults [ Perkin OJ, McGuigan PM, Stokes KA.

J Aging Phys Act  2022 Feb 01;30(1):33-43  [ FREE Full text ] [ CrossRef ] [ Medline ] 19 ]. Technology has the potential to support PA at home. Recent studies have focused on wearables and activity trackers such as Fitbit [ Vargemidis D, Gerling KM, Spiel K, Abeele VV, Geurts L. Wearable physical activity tracking systems for older adults—a systematic review.

JMIR Mhealth Uhealth  2019 Apr 12;7(4):e11819  [ FREE Full text ] [ CrossRef ] [ Medline ] 21 ]. However, these devices tend to focus on supervising or monitoring older adults and tend to support a limited number of activities, especially cardiovascular activities such as walking [ Vargemidis D, Gerling KM, Spiel K, Abeele VV, Geurts L. Wearable physical activity tracking systems for older adults—a systematic review. ACM Trans Comput Healthc  2020 Sep 30;1(4):1-37  [ FREE Full text ] [ CrossRef ] 20 ]. Given their reliance on measuring steps and location, they are unsuitable for supporting strength and balance exercises. Similarly, previous studies on supporting older adults’ exercise at home have focused on more complex solutions such as Kinect [ Ganesan S, Anthony L. Using the kinect to encourage older adults to exercise: a prototype.

Socially assistive robotics: robot exercise trainer for older adults. Technologies  2018;6(1):32  [ FREE Full text ] [ CrossRef ] 23 ]. These solutions are expensive and require planning to fit the exercise sessions into one’s day. Owing to the situated nature of exercise snacking and its links with everyday routines, Internet of Things (IoT) devices are well suited to provide technological support. IoT devices can be easily embedded at home and provide both monitoring and guidance, such as reducing office workers’ sedentary behavior [ Huang Y, Benford S, Price D, Patel R, Li B, Ivanov A,  et al.

As such, they could be used to support exercise snacking at home as part of routine everyday activities. Objectives This project explored how ubiquitous technology could be embedded in the home setting to support community-dwelling older adults who are prefrail with exercise snacking activities to improve strength and balance. It builds on previous studies that have demonstrated exercise snacking to be as effective as resistance training in improving muscle functioning [ Perkin OJ, McGuigan PM, Stokes KA. Exercise snacking to improve muscle function in healthy older adults: a pilot study. J Aging Res  2019 Oct 03;2019:7516939  [ FREE Full text ] [ CrossRef ] [ Medline ] 16 ] but has the added benefit of overcoming barriers to engagement in PA for older adults. The main objective was to develop and test a set of interactive prototypes that could be embedded in the home environment to support strength and balance exercises. To do so, we engaged older adults who are prefrail in the design of the prototypes and conducted an exploratory home evaluation. Health technologies tend to be designed without consideration of older adults’ perspectives about PA [ Gerling KM, Ray M, Abeele VV, Evans AB.

ACM Trans Access Comput  2020 Apr 21;13(1):1-23  [ FREE Full text ] [ CrossRef ] 27 ], which can reduce their usability or adoption within this user group. Therefore, our goal was to work directly with older adults and use their input and ideas as a starting point to ensure that the prototypes addressed their needs. Methods Approach This project followed an iterative, user-centered design (UCD) process [ Gulliksen J, Göransson B, Boivie I, Blomkvist S, Persson J, Cajander Å. Key principles for user-centred systems design. Behav Inf Technol  2003;22(6):397-409  [ FREE Full text ] [ CrossRef ] 28 ] to identify the requirements for initial prototypes and explore their potential; however, we did keep in mind the principles of person-based approach [ Yardley L, Morrison L, Bradbury K, Muller I. The person-based approach to intervention development: application to digital health-related behavior change interventions. J Med Internet Res  2015 Jan 30;17(1):e30  [ FREE Full text ] [ CrossRef ] [ Medline ] 29 ], as this work will be used as a starting point for the development of a future behavior change intervention. Study 1 (design workshops) aimed to identify appropriate exercises that older adults are willing to do at home and attitudes and preferences toward technologies that might support PA. Study 2 (home evaluation) then developed and piloted new prototype technology informed by the results of study 1. Participants and Recruitment We recruited 16 community-dwelling older adults who are prefrail from participants of a randomized controlled trial (focused on encouraging PA among older adults [ Stathi A, Withall J, Greaves CJ, Thompson JL, Taylor G, Medina-Lara A,  et al.

Trials  2018 Apr 17;19(1):228  [ FREE Full text ] [ CrossRef ] [ Medline ] 30 ]) who consented to be approached for future research projects. Of the 16 individuals, 11 (69%) participated in study 1 (mean age 74, SD 5.5; range 69-89 years). Of the 11 participants, 7 (64%) were women and all (n=11, 100%) were White British. A further 5 participants participated in study 2 (mean age 74, SD 4.87; range 69-80 years), and 3 (60%) of them were women. Participants who responded to the study email advertisements were sent a participant information sheet describing the study. Study 1—Design Workshops Materials Study 1 involved two 2-hour design workshops in Bristol, the United Kingdom. To facilitate discussions, participants were provided with handouts showing examples of specific muscle strengthening and balance exercises and simple Tai Chi movements they could do at home, which were also demonstrated to participants by a trained exercise instructor (IJL). A set of electronic components (eg, proximity sensors, pressure mats, vibrating components, and lights), examples of wearable devices (eg, a smartwatch and an activity tracker), and an Amazon Alexa were used to facilitate the discussions about technology supporting exercise snacking at home. Procedures Workshops were conducted on the same day in February 2020 within a Sensor Platform for Healthcare in a Residential Environment (SPHERE) smart home [ Elsts A, Fafoutis X, Woznowski P, Tonkin EL, Oikonomou G, Piechocki RJ,  et al. Enabling healthcare in smart homes: the SPHERE IoT network infrastructure. IEEE Commun Mag  2018 Dec;56(12):164-170  [ FREE Full text ] [ CrossRef ] 31 ]. The smart home belongs to the University of Bristol and is a terraced house with several rooms equipped with various sensors such as movement sensors and near-field communication (NFC) tags. The sensors were visible throughout the home; however, they were not used as part of this study. Nevertheless, participants were able to see how smart technologies could be implemented in a home environment, which facilitated discussions about how new devices could fit into their existing homes. Each session started by discussing the participants’ current PA levels, including home-based and group activities and any barriers to exercise that they had encountered. Exercise snacking and exercise handouts (preferred format and content) were then discussed. A researcher and trained exercise instructor demonstrated 5 exercise snacking and 5 Tai Chi snacking movements [ Liang IJ, Perkin OJ, McGuigan PM, Thompson D, Western MJ.

This session was conducted in a living room, and participants were able to use chairs and a sofa as part of the exercises. Participants then discussed their thoughts about the exercises and how they could be fit into their daily routines and home environments. Participants then moved through the house (kitchen, bathroom, bedroom, and dining room), discussing suitable exercises for each room, how rooms differed from their own environment, and how that difference could affect the exercise. In addition, any technology that could support and prompt exercise was discussed. This was facilitated by a member of the research team. Subsequently, 1 researcher presented examples of various technologies and sensors, explaining how each item worked and how it could be used in practice. Participants then discussed which components and devices could be useful to support exercise snacking in their home environment. After the study, participants received a shopping voucher worth £10 (US $12.91) for participating in the workshop. Study 2—Feasibility Evaluation With Semistructured Interviews Materials On the basis of the key findings from study 1, a total of 2 types of interactive prototypes were built: 1 to support 1-legged balance exercises and 1 to support sit-to-stand exercises ( Figure 1 ). These 2 activities were chosen because participants agreed that they were useful and were the easiest to be integrated into their everyday routines, that is, were easy to master and could be done anywhere at home. Each prototype consisted of a pressure mat and a companion screen. As their design was influenced by study-1 results, more details are provided in the Prototype Development section after study-1 results. The prototypes were accompanied by a booklet explaining exercise snacking and the 2 selected exercises, with advice about how to do them correctly and suggestions of times and places at home where they could be done. The booklet also included a setup and troubleshooting guide. \u200e Figure 1.  Exercise snacking prototypes for supporting (A) 1-leg balance and (B) sit-to-stand exercises. Images were captured by the researchers to demonstrate potential locations for the prototypes. Procedures The evaluation study consisted of 2 parts (an exploratory home evaluation and an interview) and was conducted in Bath, the United Kingdom, between May 2021 and June 2021. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. No personally identifying information was collected and the data were anonymized. Prototypes were delivered to participants’ homes by a researcher; participants also received written setup instructions, and the researcher was available via telephone to provide any further technical and exercise support. Owing to COVID-19 restrictions, the researcher followed a COVID-19–secure process, which involved contactless delivery and collection, with no entry into the participant’s home. Each participant received both prototypes (balance mat and sit-to-stand mat) and was requested to use them for a single day. They were asked to think about their everyday routines and place the prototypes and the feedback screen in spaces where they would be the most likely to see and use them without having to go to a dedicated room. After delivering the prototypes, the researcher explained each exercise to the participant over the telephone. At the end of the day, a researcher collected the prototypes and, later, conducted the telephone interview. Interviews lasted approximately 30 to 45 minutes and covered participants’ general experience of setting up and using the prototypes, views about the utility of the technology going forward, and their general views about how to improve the prototypes or better integrate technology into their daily lives. After that, participants received a shopping voucher worth £30 (US $41.67) for testing the prototypes at home and participating in the phone interviews. Ethics Approval Both studies received favorable ethical opinion from the University of Bristol (project ID 99482) and Cardiff University (COMSC/Ethics/2020/071). Data Analysis Study-1 workshop discussions were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim for subsequent analysis. Any mention of participants’ names in the transcripts was replaced by participant numbers before the analysis. Transcripts were analyzed thematically [ Braun V, Clarke V. Using thematic analysis in psychology. Qual Res Psychol  2006 Jan;3(2):77-101  [ FREE Full text ] [ CrossRef ] 32 ] using both deductive and inductive approaches to explore insights related to the specific topics we focused on and any unexpected findings. Before analysis, transcripts were read to identify specific features for the prototypes, so that they could be incorporated by the developer while data analysis continued. One of the authors (IJL) coded all the transcripts. Codes were then reviewed and discussed by 2 other authors (KS and MW), who identified the provisional themes and drafted the results. The themes and draft findings were then reviewed and discussed with all authors until the final themes were fully defined. Study 2 ended with semistructured telephone interviews, which were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Transcripts were anonymized. Framework analysis [ Ritchie J, Lewis J, Nicholls CM, Ormston R. Qualitative Research Practice: A Guide for Social Science Students and Researchers. Thousand Oaks, CA, USA: Sage Publications; Nov 2003. 33 ] was applied to the data, as the authors were interested in specific topics. Following familiarization and coding of the transcripts, one of the authors (AW) created a framework table using interview questions as categories (columns), and each participant was allocated a row, with codes in corresponding cells. Then, 2 authors (AW and KS) summarized the findings in each cell to identify potential themes. Provisional themes were drafted by 2 authors (KS and MW) and then discussed with all authors, leading to the strengthening of some themes and removal of others. Results Study 1—Workshops Overview We were interested in understanding participants’ views about and attitudes toward exercise, PA at home, and technology—these discussion topics formed the initial structure for resulting themes. Within each topic, themes and subthemes identified through the analysis are reported. They are summarized with representative quotes in Multimedia Appendix 1 A table with quotes to illustrate the subthemes identified in the workshops for each discussion topic. PDF File  (Adobe PDF File), 203 KB Multimedia Appendix 1 and described in more detail in the following sections. Topic 1—Attitudes Toward Exercise Several themes were identified in relation to common barriers to participation . A common point of discussion centered around leisure settings being viewed as a nonwelcoming space for older adults. Several participants pointed to leisure centers and gyms as being young and male dominant, whereas others recognized that much of the provision for older adults was group based, with participants noting that they felt a lack of confidence in exercising with others. There were also barriers relating to individuals’ motivation to do regular exercise. This was linked to the fear of falling and injury or lack of baseline strength, which made exercise a perceived risky prospect. However, despite these participation barriers, there was a strong sense that exercise was important to the participants, with many highlighting the health and well-being benefits it brings. Participants also recognized exercise to be a way of building confidence to stay engaged in other forms of social and leisure activity. Similarly, the social aspect of exercise itself was regarded as a key driver for participation, particularly for walking and aerobic activities. Participants generally agreed that exercise should match the profile and ability of the target user and saw potential in exercise snacking to overcome this issue. For example, there were exercises that were much more suited to people in their later life, particularly owing to their physical capabilities, such as balance or sit-to-stand exercise. In this regard, the exercise snacking concept was viewed favorably, as it was seen to enable people to build up from different baselines and progress on their own terms and appeared to be easy to master as a set of exercises. In addition, it could help to overcome other barriers that participants had mentioned—including the ability to do PA in a low-risk environment that was not a leisure setting. Tai Chi movements, as a proposed format of exercise snacking, had more of a mixed reception, with preconceptions both acknowledging it as a useful, relaxing exercise but potentially tricky to learn. Topic 2—Exercising in the Home Environment The second topic explored how the home environment might support or hinder regular engagement in exercise snacking. While walking around the smart home environment, some participants commented about the impact of location and how different spaces lend themselves to exercise more than others. For example, it was apparent that the amount of floor space in a room was important for it to be seen as a space to exercise in. Another consideration was the need to work around other people at home, including partners, spouses, grandchildren, or pets. There was also a sense that certain rooms had a particular function that would preclude them from being a place for exercise, such as the dining room. Much of the conversation about the suitability of spaces to exercise centered on safety in the home environment . Having solid objects to hold on and to support balance and stability where necessary was seen as an important consideration, with key examples in the more spacious rooms being kitchen worktops and chairs. In addition, for some formats of exercise, such as balancing, having soft furnishings and carpeted floors would make the environment feel safer than hard spaces. A final theme related to the home environment was how certain spaces or everyday tasks could be used as opportunistic contextual cues to prompt exercise snacking . For example, the lounge was suggested as a good place to be prompted and do exercise, as it is typically the space where older adults would otherwise sit for long periods—as such, it would be suitable for exercises that can be done while sitting. Some people identified everyday actions that could prompt their exercise snacking, such as brushing teeth, boiling the kettle, or washing dishes. As they were part of the routine and usually occurred in the same spot, they could be linked with exercises suitable for that space, for example, balance exercises. Topic 3—Opportunities and Challenges of Using Technology at Home Finally, when discussing the use of technology, it was apparent that participants were already familiar with a range of technologies (eg, apps, Amazon Alexa, Fitbit for tracking steps, and YouTube videos to support exercise) and referred to existing solutions to highlight their strengths and weaknesses. On the basis of this previous experience, they had clear expectations of what technologies would work and would not work for them. For example, they all agreed that any system that aims to support PA at home should be discreet or even hidden, as not everyone felt comfortable “advertising” with technology that they were trying to be more active. In addition, such systems should also work for people with low technology literacy and be as simple and easy to use and set up as possible. As such, some participants also thought that limiting functionality would help to make the technology easy to use. This need for simplicity was also linked with a need to consider the context of use . This included accounting for the realities of everyday life and characteristics of the users. A participant mentioned that ideal technology would be something they could use without having to wear glasses. Another participant pointed out that the technology would be a part of a wide ecosystem and, therefore, would need to easily connect to the local wireless network and work with other devices at home. Furthermore, it should be inexpensive, as even smartphones or smartwatches were seen as being beyond the reach of a regular person. Participants also identified several opportunities for exercise snacking technologies . They agreed that technology should provide instructions, feedback, and reminders. Instructions were seen as an important feature that could help to introduce the correct movements; help users understand how to exercise (eg, frequency and when to stop); and later, help check whether they were exercising correctly, especially if no additional support was provided. Regarding the latter point, participants expressed a desire to have access to either support groups or someone they could discuss their progress with. Furthermore, visual prompts could also be used to provide ongoing feedback and situated instructions, for example, by showing the movements one is supposed to execute or simply providing encouragement to motivate the user. In addition, some participants thought that this type of interaction could be more playful and “witty.” Overall, participants were open to trying new technologies. Having identified the best locations and types of exercises, they also suggested building devices that could be incorporated into everyday objects to encourage exercise snacking in a specific location. Prototype Development Study-1 results informed the design of the prototypes. Given that participants expressed interest in exercise snacking and engaging with simple exercises at home, we decided to develop prototypes based around a pressure mat that could be placed anywhere at home, where it would fit best into participants’ daily routine. This form factor would also allow participants to just use it (stand or sit on it) without having to set things up in preparation, which was another aspect identified by participants. Finally, as participants expressed interest in systems that are discreet or hidden, a light-emitting diode (LED) companion screen was included to provide additional visual feedback that did not explicitly mention exercise. We developed 2 prototypes. Each consisted of a pressure mat and a battery pack. We used SensingTex Switch mat that enabled a single pressure point recognition ( Figure 2 ). We selected a pressure mat as the basis of each prototype, as it would not require any complex interactions, and participants would only need to stand on it if they were ready to exercise. Each mat was connected via Bluetooth to a Raspberry Pi 4 and a Unicorn HAT LED Matrix. The LED screen provided feedback to the user because without it, owing to the mat’s minimal interface, it was not clear whether the prototype was active or whether participants were reaching their goals. The screen also provided encouragement and motivation. Although both prototypes appeared similar, they had different underlying algorithms to account for differences in the exercises. The balance mat was set up for 2 daily repetitions, 60 seconds each, as a default, and the sit-to-stand mat was set up to measure movement repetitions for 60 seconds during each exercise session, with the target of 30 repetitions per day. When stepped on, the prototype would trigger a timer, which was shown on the LED screen. The devices recorded the number of repetitions and time spent on each exercise. Figure 3 shows examples of the visual feedback—a smiling face if the daily target has been reached, a frowning face if it has not been reached yet, and a progress bar to help count down time during an exercise session.

Study 2—Home Evaluation The second study focused on evaluating the prototypes at home. Unlike study 1, it was more exploratory in nature—we did not have predefined topics in mind beyond understanding how the participants used the prototypes and what they thought about them. Participants’ Use of Technology All participants (5/5, 100%) reported using the internet and having previous experience in using mobile phones, laptops, PCs, and tablets. Consumer electronics they used were often Apple products, the sleek design of which was referenced by participants when discussing the study prototypes. Most participants (4/5, 80%) reported that they used some type of activity tracker (often step counters on their phone) and were generally positive toward these types of technologies. Of the 5 participants, 1 (20%) participant mentioned using a heart rate monitor and 2 (40%) reported watching exercise videos on YouTube (fitness and yoga) during the COVID-19 lockdowns to help them stay active. These technologies and participants’ experiences influenced how they interacted with our prototypes and their expectations toward the devices. In the following sections, we describe 4 themes identified in the interviews conducted after the home evaluation. Importance of Design Esthetics and Reliability The study findings highlighted the importance of selecting the right level of complexity and polishing the design of initial prototypes used for testing. As the study’s goal was to explore how the technology fits into people’s homes and could support exercise snacking, we focused primarily on the functionality and did not prioritize the design at this stage. Therefore, our participants thought the prototypes were crude (“The graphics I thought were very crude. I think they could have been more pixels in the display to make the pictures easier to understand.” [Participant 5]) and unfinished (“That equipment was quite awkward, you know, the cables and the fittings and the plugs didn’t seem to fit very securely. It was all kind of it all looked a bit fragile.” [Participant 3]), which affected how they used them. Some participants were not sure whether they could fold the mats for storage or whether that would damage them. Participants also found it cumbersome to assemble the prototypes and to remember to switch them on and off to preserve the battery. This led to technical issues when they connected things incorrectly or the prototypes were not working properly, which discouraged participants from using the devices. Therefore, although participants agreed that the devices had potential and “tools like this” could be useful, they did not see a clear benefit of using the prototypes in their current form: The technology is too crude and intrusive at this early stage, compared with either a) doing without or b) doing something clever with it. [Participant 1] Challenges With Fitting the Device Into Everyday Life The prototypes were designed such that they could be used in different places at home to enable participants to fit exercise snacking into their routines. Although it mostly worked, participants highlighted a few practical considerations. A participant reported that they had to rearrange their house and move a chair to the kitchen so that they could do the sit-to-stand exercise: I’ve got lots of things all over the place. For this trial, I put them in the kitchen. But it would be in the way if I left there every day. I’d have to find somewhere else. [Participant 1] In addition, the balance mat was perceived as a potential trip hazard and participants were not keen to leave it on the floor when not in use: If I kept it there during the day, I could easily trip on it. Anybody could trip or slip as well because I have a wooden floor so it could slip quite easily. [Participant 2] In addition, some did not want the prototypes to always be visible owing to their looks and found packing and unpacking the devices to be cumbersome. Similarly, the limited battery life required the device to be switched off when not in use, which added an extra burden. Overall, although exercise snacking was supposed to be easy and effortless, having to set things up defeated the purpose of the prototypes. Participants acknowledged that although having a dedicated tool could, in principle, make exercising easy, using preexisting methods or devices was perceived as easy and more useful. Improved reliability, more polished look, and easy set up would make exercise snacking systems more motivating and appealing: I think [the prototypes] just feel, um, they don’t feel user friendly and they don’t feel...they feel like old technology. I think it would need to have a screen; it would need to look like a phone; it would need to have a digital reader, you know, all of that, like the apps we have on our phone. [Participant 3] Need for Personalization The initial design of the prototypes allowed changes to the difficulty levels and the number of repetitions. However, in scaling down the project owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, the researcher gave all participants (5/5, 100%) the same device with default settings. This proved to be problematic, and participants consistently commented that the exercises were either very easy or very difficult: The balance exercise is quite easy, and the sit-to-stand is more strenuous. It’s hard work. It takes more energy and makes me tired. [Participant 5] A positive side effect observed was increased motivation of a participant who started using weights to make the exercises more challenging (“I put a rucksack on my back and weights in it and I did it like that to get myself...to make [sit-to-stand exercises] harder.” [Participant 3]), which suggested that the device could be useful for initiating exercise behavior or as a gateway to people forming a new routine: If it’s there, you’ll use it. And that’s just getting into the regime, it’s like, in the morning, you'll sort of do 10 minutes of different exercises...And it just becomes a habit. [Participant 4] Issues with difficulty levels and progression led to discussions about exercise personalization and suggestions for future improvements. Participants believed that exercises needed to be adapted to the user and therefore suggested including some progression to keep users engaged, for example, by increasing the complexity or difficulty of movements: Trick is to make it sufficiently interesting and challenging to those who find it fairly easy, but also not to put off people who find it harder and struggle to get out of the chair, so maybe if you had a series of levels so you could come in at level one or you could jump to level three. [Participant 3] They also highlighted the need for feedback about the movements and progress, which would help with motivation and could support the increasing difficulty levels (a participant suggested a potential app similar to the Couch to 5K running program but for strength and balance). Future Opportunities When asked for views about the potential of technology to support home-based exercise after using the prototypes, participants identified several desirable features to improve utility. Features included linking of the devices to a more sophisticated app or sensors to provide more detailed feedback (“If the mat sensed the growing extent of my imbalance and reduced the time, or increased it if my balance was perfect, that would be a bit more useful, and if it sensed where my toes or heel or whatever was going wrong, and issued warnings about posture then that would make it more useful.” [Participant 1]), adding voice or sound as a way of providing feedback about performance of exercises and encouragement, and prompts and reminders to do the exercise. Participants also discussed how the prototypes could be improved. Some suggestions focused more on how the mat could support a more diverse array of exercises: It would be nice to have a wider range of exercises. I mean, as you get old your backs get stiff. You get stiffness in lots of joints. I think that it could be done to use more joints as a body, try and create more flexibility. [Participant 5] Participants also provided positive perspectives about the role of technology in supporting home-based exercise, for example, providing visual prompts: The little pad would be sitting on the floor, would be a reminder. [Participant 5] Others discussed how functioning technology could provide structure to support current activity and could be useful for engaging people in new activities in the short term, even if not used continuously: At the moment I do it when I can see I’ve got two or three minutes to do sit to stand. So I do. [Participant 1] Discussion Principal Findings Overview The aim of this project was to develop and test interactive prototypes to be used at home to support strength and balance exercise snacking in older adults who are prefrail. Our workshops identified that participants were open to using technology in the home setting, but personalization of the exercise snacking regime and simplicity in technology use are important. Participants who subsequently tested 2 prototypes (balance mat and sit-to-stand mat) in a home evaluation demonstrated that this technology had the potential to support exercise snacking in the home setting with further development and testing. In the following sections, we discuss the main results and implications for designing systems that support exercise snacking at home for older adults who are prefrail. Home Environment as a Space to Exercise Exercise was identified as an important activity for participants, and using the home setting as a location for exercise snacking elicited both positive and constructive views, which will inform the next iterative step in the design process. The home setting has been frequently used for rehabilitative exercise for multiple conditions such as musculoskeletal joint replacement, neurological conditions, and cardiorespiratory conditions and has been shown to be as effective as supervised or group exercise at 12 weeks on health outcomes for women with type 2 diabetes [ Dadgostar H, Firouzinezhad S, Ansari M, Younespour S, Mahmoudpour A, Khamseh ME. Supervised group-exercise therapy versus home-based exercise therapy: their effects on quality of life and cardiovascular risk factors in women with type 2 diabetes. Diabetes Metab Syndr  2016;10(2 Suppl 1):S30-S36. [ CrossRef ] [ Medline ] 34 ]. A recent pilot randomized controlled trial has demonstrated that resistance exercise snacking is safe and acceptable for community-dwelling older adults over a 4-week period. Although this project focused on only 1 strength exercise and 1 balance exercise, the results align with those of Fyfe et al [ Fyfe JJ, Dalla Via J, Jansons P, Scott D, Daly RM. Feasibility and acceptability of a remotely delivered, home-based, pragmatic resistance 'exercise snacking' intervention in community-dwelling older adults: a pilot randomised controlled trial. BMC Geriatr  2022 Jun 25;22(1):521  [ FREE Full text ] [ CrossRef ] [ Medline ] 35 ] and Liang et al [ Liang IJ, Perkin OJ, McGuigan PM, Thompson D, Western MJ. Feasibility and acceptability of home-based exercise snacking and tai chi snacking delivered remotely to self-isolating older adults during COVID-19. J Aging Phys Act  2022 Feb 01;30(1):33-43  [ FREE Full text ] [ CrossRef ] [ Medline ] 19 ], who found the exercises to be feasible and safe. Role of Technology for Overcoming Barriers A key challenge for any exercise program, especially those targeting individuals in the home setting, is prolonged adherence [ Hancox JE, van der Wardt V, Pollock K, Booth V, Vedhara K, Harwood RH. Factors influencing adherence to home-based strength and balance exercises among older adults with mild cognitive impairment and early dementia: promoting activity, independence and stability in early dementia (PrAISED). PLoS One  2019 May 23;14(5):e0217387  [ FREE Full text ] [ CrossRef ] [ Medline ] 36 ]. Participants in this study were largely positive about the potential for technology to support the implementation of home-based exercise snacking as long as the technology was simple, reliable, and unobtrusive to use. The need for simplicity and reliability as key guiding principles for the adoption and sustained use of technology has been found in other studies of older adults’ perceptions about technology [ Hawley-Hague H, Boulton E, Hall A, Pfeiffer K, Todd C. Older adults' perceptions of technologies aimed at falls prevention, detection or monitoring: a systematic review. Int J Med Inform  2014 Jun;83(6):416-426. [ CrossRef ] [ Medline ] 37 ]. Technology, if designed appropriately, also enables the integration of some key behavioral science principles that can help with exercise motivation, such as self-regulatory behavior change techniques (eg, feedback and goal setting) and gamification to make exercise fun and engaging [ Hawley-Hague H, Boulton E, Hall A, Pfeiffer K, Todd C. Older adults' perceptions of technologies aimed at falls prevention, detection or monitoring: a systematic review. Int J Med Inform  2014 Jun;83(6):416-426.

J Med Internet Res  2021 Jul 30;23(7):e26235  [ FREE Full text ] [ CrossRef ] [ Medline ] 39 ], and nudges or cues to help turn exercise into a more automatic behavior [ Forberger S, Reisch L, Kampfmann T, Zeeb H.

Int J Behav Nutr Phys Act  2019 Sep 03;16(1):77  [ FREE Full text ] [ CrossRef ] [ Medline ] 40 ]. Our preliminary evaluation suggested that more work could be done to improve the reliability of the technology, better integrate feedback, and make the device more personalized to the user’s needs and preferences for exercise. Recommendations for Future Practice and Studies Accordingly, we provide design recommendations for developing home-based systems that support exercise snacking and other types of PA aimed at older adults. Researchers and developers working in this area should do the following: Support personalization —As older adults can have varying levels of activity, any home-based system that facilitates and supports exercise needs to be able to accommodate different baseline circumstances, from fully sedentary routines to physically active users who may want to move more at home. As such, systems should allow users to change difficulty levels, which should then progressively adapt based on the user’s progress. Provide clear and meaningful feedback —As exercise snacking is a situated activity, any system that supports it needs to recognize and clearly communicate that it has started and notify the user when they can finish, regardless of whether they are doing timed exercises or a specific number of repetitions. It should also notify the users when they reach their goals and show their progress. Furthermore, different feedback modalities need to be considered to improve accessibility and usability through combinations of visual and auditory feedback to support older adults with hearing and visual impairments. Take the environment into account —Any system that supports exercise at home needs to be sufficiently flexible, so that people can use it in the most suitable location. Different people have different routines, and the living situation of older adults varies, which makes it impractical to design a one-size-fits-all solution. For example, some people may prefer to exercise snack in the living room, whereas others would prefer to do so in the kitchen; ideally, the system should work in both. Remember the esthetics —The design of technologies aimed at older adults is often based on a wrong assumption that esthetics do not matter for this user group. However, increasing access to consumer electronics influences the perceptions about technology and people’s expectations and values; older adults are not different [ Desai S, McGrath C, McNeil H, Sveistrup H, McMurray J, Astell A. Experiential value of technologies: a qualitative study with older adults. Int J Environ Res Public Health  2022 Feb 16;19(4):2235  [ FREE Full text ] [ CrossRef ] [ Medline ] 41 ]. Furthermore, any device that is meant to become part of an environment should fit into that environment and ideally provide subtle and discreet feedback, as not all users may want to advertise to visitors that they are trying to be more active. Ensure the system is accessible and easy to use —As older adults’ experiences with technology or digital literacy may be limited, any system aimed at them should have an intuitive design and require minimal setup. Switching technology on and off and selecting user goals and preferences should be implemented in a user-friendly manner that is suitable for the target population. Furthermore, systems should be compatible with the technologies that people already have at home, for example, wireless networks. As most IoT systems rely on the internet connection, the ease of setup and seamless connectivity are key. Provide guidance to reduce risks —Finally, any system that supports PA needs to be able to guide the users, as the movements may not be familiar to them or they may require a reminder. This can be directly embedded in the physical system or be provided through a companion app. Regardless of the format, guidance could help to reduce risks of falls, support older users, and educate users about PA. Limitations and Future Studies This was an exploratory project focusing on the early stages of the iterative UCD process and as such had some limitations. Study-1 participant numbers were limited by space and maximum capacity for people in the smart home at the time; however, the numbers were consistent with those in previous design research using workshops to design digital interventions [ Stawarz K, Preist C, Tallon D, Wiles N, Kessler D, Turner K,  et al. Design considerations for the integrated delivery of cognitive behavioral therapy for depression: user-centered design study. JMIR Ment Health  2020 Sep 03;7(9):e15972  [ FREE Full text ] [ CrossRef ] [ Medline ] 42 ]. Study 2 involved 5 participants who used the prototypes for 1 day. As our goal was to assess the usability of the prototypes and gather early feedback, this was sufficient, because usually 4 to 6 participants are required to identify key usability issues [ Nielsen J, Landauer TK. A mathematical model of the finding of usability problems. In: Proceedings of the ACM CHI 93 Human Factors in Computing Systems Conference. 1993 Presented at: INTERCHI '93; April 24-29, 1993; Amsterdam, The Netherlands p. 206-213 \n                        \xa0 URL: https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/169059.169166 [ CrossRef ] 43 ]. Participants were vocal about issues and constructive suggestions for improvement. Overall, our participant numbers are consistent with UCD studies, and evidence has shown that these methods can provide generalizable design guidelines [ Anderson NS, Norman DA, Draper SW. User centered system design: new perspectives on human-computer interaction. Am J Psychol  1988;101(1):148-151  [ FREE Full text ] [ CrossRef ] 44 - Shneiderman B, Plaisant C. Designing the User Interface: Strategies for Effective Human-Computer Interaction. 5th edition. London, UK: Pearson; 2010. 47 ]. Participants were recruited from a cohort that had previously participated in a PA trial [ Stathi A, Greaves CJ, Thompson JL, Withall J, Ladlow P, Taylor G,  et al. Effect of a physical activity and behaviour maintenance programme on functional mobility decline in older adults: the REACT (retirement in action) randomised controlled trial. Lancet Public Health  2022 Apr;7(4):e316-e326  [ FREE Full text ] [ CrossRef ] [ Medline ] 48 ], albeit a mixture of intervention and control participants. Selection bias may have influenced the results obtained, as the participants may have had more positive attitudes toward PA. However, as this was the initial phase in the design process, both benefits of and challenges to developing technology were identified, and future stages in this process (acceptability, feasibility, and efficacy testing) will ensure a wide, representative, and large recruitment of older adults who are prefrail to avoid potential bias [ Skivington K, Matthews L, Simpson SA, Craig P, Baird J, Blazeby JM,  et al. A new framework for developing and evaluating complex interventions: update of medical research council guidance. BMJ  2021 Sep 30;374:n2061  [ FREE Full text ] [ CrossRef ] [ Medline ] 49 ]. In addition, recruitment from this population enabled participants to reflect about their previous experiences with exercise snacking and provide feedback and suggestions for improvement, which was crucial for this study. Study 2 was a home study conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic and, consequently, was subject to several deviations from the initial protocol. These limitations influenced the participants’ experiences, which is reflected in the themes. Nevertheless, key lessons were learned about the design and delivery of technology home testing during COVID-19, which can be embedded in the future stages of this project to ensure successful delivery and completion, regardless of whether there is face-to-face or remote delivery. Furthermore, as home testing occurred over a single day, we were unable to evaluate the adherence to exercise snacking. As adherence is crucial to the acceptability and feasibility of the exercise snacking technology design, factors predicting adherence to home-based rehabilitation (intention to engage, self-motivation, self-efficacy, previous adherence, and social support [ Essery R, Geraghty AW, Kirby S, Yardley L. Predictors of adherence to home-based physical therapies: a systematic review. Disabil Rehabil  2017 Mar;39(6):519-534. [ CrossRef ] [ Medline ] 50 ]) will be incorporated into subsequent iterations of the design process. Finally, the design of our prototypes may have influenced the results. Our primary focus was the functionality of the prototypes; we did not fully consider esthetics or visual design at this stage. This resulted in negative comments and, to some degree, affected participants’ interactions with the prototypes. Although we were still able to gather relevant feedback, more polished prototypes and user interfaces would have helped to concentrate the feedback on functionality. As we are following the UCD process, this will be incorporated into the next iterative phase of development of the prototypes. Conclusions Exercise snacking offers a promising approach for incorporating balance and strength PA into older adults’ routines. Our results demonstrated that technology has the potential to support exercise snacking in the home environment for older adults who are prefrail. However, the design of devices not only needs to be easy to use and set up but must also fit into users’ routines and physical spaces. Exercise snacking technology devices also need to be adaptable and personalized to individuals, to ensure that users are snacking on balance and strengthening exercises that are appropriate for them.

According to a newly proposed dual-mode model, affective responses have been proposed to vary depending on whether exercise is undertaken above or below the anaerobic threshold. With the model in mind, the study objectives were to explore the impact of an above-lactate, below-lactate, and self-selected exercise condition on acute affective responses in sedentary individuals. Design Using a repeated measures design, 12 volunteers participated in two prescribed intensity exercise conditions (above and below-lactate threshold) and one self-selected intensity exercise condition. The three conditions were randomized. Method An incremental walking protocol was used to identify exercise intensities that would elicit above- and below-lactate threshold work rates for each participant. The exercise conditions were completed on different days and each lasted for 20 minutes. Physiological and affective responses were recorded pre-exercise, during exercise, and post-exercise. Results Affective responses were more negative in the above-lactate condition during exercise compared with the below-lactate and self-selected conditions. There were no differences between the conditions post-exercise. Participants exercised around the lactate threshold and at a significantly higher intensity in the self-selected compared with the below-lactate condition. Inter-individual variability in responses was greatest below the lactate threshold, with similar levels of variability in the self-selected and above-lactate conditions. Conclusions Data are consistent with the proposals of the dual-mode model and support the use of self-selected intensity with sedentary individuals to promote positive affective responses.

However, recent epidemiologic evidence suggests that sitting time has deleterious cardiovascular and metabolic effects that are independent of whether adults meet physical activity guidelines. Evidence from “inactivity physiology” laboratory studies has identified unique mechanisms that are distinct from the biologic bases of exercising. Opportunities for sedentary behaviors are ubiquitous and are likely to increase with further innovations in technologies. We present a compelling selection of emerging evidence on the deleterious effects of sedentary behavior, as it is underpinned by the unique physiology of inactivity. It is time to consider excessive sitting a serious health hazard, with the potential for ultimately giving consideration to the inclusion of too much sitting (or too few breaks from sitting) in physical activity and health guidelines.

The purposes of this study were: (1) to assess the effectiveness of a 16-week progressive program of home-based, videotape-based, low-impact aerobic exercise on physical function and signs and symptoms of fibromyalgia in previously sedentary women aged 20 to 55 years and (2) to compare the effects of 1 long exercise bout versus 2 short exercise bouts per training day (fractionation) on physical function, signs and symptoms of fibromyalgia, and exercise adherence. Subjects. One hundred forty-three sedentary women were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups: a group who trained using a long bout of exercise (LBE group, n=51), a group who trained using short bouts of exercise (SBE group, n=56), and a group who performed no exercise (NE group, n=36). Methods. The SBE group exercised twice daily, and the LBE group worked out once daily. Both groups progressed in total daily training duration from 10 to 30 minutes, 3 to 5 times a week, for 16 weeks. Physical and psychological well-being, symptoms, and self-efficacy were evaluated using a multivariate analysis of variance. Results. Dropout rates for the NE, SBE, and LBE groups were 14%, 38%, and 29%, respectively. The NE group differed from the LBE group in disease severity, self-efficacy, and psychological well-being (midtest, efficacy analysis) and from the SBE group in disease severity and self-efficacy (posttest, efficacy analysis). Exercise adherence was greater for the LBE group than for the SBE group between weeks 5 and 8 of the training program. No other differences between exercise groups were found. Discussion and Conclusion. Progressive, home-based, low-impact aerobics improved physical function and fibromyalgia symptoms minimally in participants who completed at least two thirds of the recommended exercise. Fractionation of exercise training provided no advantage in terms of exercise adherence, improvements in fibromyalgia symptoms or physical function.

This can be used for evaluation of injuries to the lower extremities. It is important to ensure that the assessment tools we use in the clinical setting and in research have minimal measurement error. Previous studies have shown that the ability to maintain standing balance is decreased by fatiguing exercise. There is, however, a need for further studies regarding possible effects of general exercise on balance in single-limb stance. The aims of this study were: 1) to assess the test-retest reliability of balance variables measured in single-limb stance on a force platform, and 2) to study the effect of exercise on balance in single-limb stance, in healthy subjects. Methods Forty-two individuals were examined for test-retest reliability, and 24 individuals were tested before (pre-exercise) and after (post-exercise) short-duration, sub-maximal cycling. Amplitude and average speed of center of pressure movements were registered in the frontal and sagittal planes. Mean difference between test and retest with 95% confidence interval, the intraclass correlation coefficient, and the Bland and Altman graphs with limits of agreement, were used as statistical methods for assessing test-retest reliability. The paired t-test was used for comparisons between pre- and post-exercise measurements. Results No difference was found between test and retest. The intraclass correlation coefficients ranged from 0.79 to 0.95 in all stabilometric variables except one. The limits of agreement revealed that small changes in an individual\'s performance cannot be detected. Higher values were found after cycling in three of the eight stabilometric variables. Conclusions The absence of systematic variation and the high ICC values, indicate that the test is reliable for distinguishing among groups of subjects. However, relatively large differences in an individual\'s balance performance would be required to confidently state that a change is real. The higher values found after cycling, indicate compensatory mechanisms intended to maintain balance, or a decreased ability to maintain balance. It is recommended that average speed and DEV 10; the variables showing the best reliability and effects of exercise, be used in future studies.

It is therefore reasonable to hypothesize that fatiguing exercise will have an effect on postural control. The maintenance and control of posture and balance in a particular position, or during movement, are fundamental for physical activity. The somatosensory, visual and vestibular systems, as well as the muscle activity, contribute to the maintenance of postural control. This is a person\'s ability to maintain an appropriate relationship between the body segments and between the body and the environment, and to keep the body\'s center of mass over the base of support when performing a task [ 2 ]. To evaluate postural control in stance, center of pressure (CP) movements can be registered by stabilometry with force platforms [ 3 ]. Some authors have reported a decrease in ability to maintain balance in bilateral stance [ 4 – 6 ], and single-limb stance [ 6 – 8 ] after fatiguing exercise, and it has been suggested that individuals are therefore at increased risk of injury when fatigued [ 6 – 8 ]. However, others have found no effect of fatiguing exercise on postural control in single-limb stance [ 9 – 11 ]. In the above-mentioned studies, fatigue was induced by exercise of the lower extremities [ 6 – 8 , 10 , 11 ], or by general fatigue [ 4 , 5 , 9 ]. Fatigue induced by general exercise, such as cycling, running or walking, better resembles conditions in daily life and physical activities than fatigue induced by exercising the lower extremities isolated in an isokinetic device. Studies of balance in single-limb stance are of importance since movement patterns of postural control are similar during the stance phase, and many injuries to the lower extremities occur during weight-bearing on one leg [ 12 ]. The effect of general fatigue on balance in single-limb stance in healthy subjects has, to our knowledge, only been investigated in one study [ 9 ]. Therefore, there is a need for further studies regarding possible effects of fatigue induced by general exercise on postural control, measured by balance in single-limb stance. It is important to ensure that the assessment tools we use in the clinical setting and in research have measurement error small enough (i.e. high reliability) to detect actual changes in what is being measured. The two components of measurement error are systematic bias, e.g., learning or fatigue effects on the test, and random error due to inherent subject or instrument variation [ 13 ]. There is a lack of consensus regarding which statistical tests are the most appropriate for use in reliability studies [ 13 ]. Several studies have used the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) as a statistical method for assessing test-retest reliability on force platforms [ 14 – 16 ]. However, the ICC has disadvantages; e.g., large variation between subjects results in high ICC values [ 13 ], and the ICC provides a value between 0 and 1 (""relative reliability""), which is difficult to interpret clinically. Therefore, it has been recommended that the ICC be complemented by calculations expressing the actual units of measurement (""absolute reliability""), such as the Bland and Altman graphs with limits of agreement (LOA), and the paired t-test or mean difference between test and retest with a 95% confidence interval (CI), to assess whether there is a statistically significant bias between the tests (systematic change in the mean) [ 13 ]. If several reliability statistics are used; i.e., relative reliability, absolute reliability and analysis of systematic change in the mean, this may provide us with sufficient information about the reliability of the assessment tool. The purposes of the present study were: 1) to assess the test-retest reliability of balance in single-limb stance measured by stabilometry on a force platform as used in previous studies [ 3 , 16 – 19 ], and 2) to study the effect of short-duration, sub-maximal cycle ergometry, a standardized method of inducing fatigue [ 20 ], on balance in single-limb stance in healthy subjects. Methods Subjects Two groups of healthy volunteers (group 1 and group 2), with no history of neurological disease, major orthopedic lesions, vestibular or visual disturbance were included in the study. Group 1 : Forty-two subjects (22 men and 20 women) were included in the test-retest reliability part of the study. Their mean age was 24 years (SD 3 years), mean height 176 cm (SD 8 cm), mean weight 69 kg (SD 10 kg), and median activity level 5 (range 2 to 7) according to the Tegner activity level scale, equal to heavy work or recreational jogging on uneven ground twice or more per week [ 21 ]. Group 2 : Twenty-four subjects (11 men and 13 women) were included in the part of the study regarding the effect of general exercise. Their mean age was 24 years (SD 3 years), mean height 176 cm (SD 8 cm), and mean weight 71 kg (SD 13 kg), and median activity level 5 (range 2 to 9) according to the Tegner activity level scale. The physical activity and age distribution of the subjects in this study were chosen in order to match patients with ligament injuries in the knee. The Research Ethics Committee at Lund University approved the study. All subjects gave their written informed consent to participate in the study. Assessment Stabilometry (group 1 and group 2) Balance in single-limb stance was tested by means of a strain gauge force plate (33 × 38 cm) with the subject barefoot in a standardized position [ 3 , 16 – 19 ] (Figure 1 ). One foot was placed pointing straight forward in relation to reference lines in the frontal and sagittal planes. The other leg was flexed 90° at the hip and knee joints with both arms hanging relaxed at the sides. The subjects were instructed to stand as motionless as possible, looking straight ahead at a point on the wall 65 cm away; they were allowed to practice maintaining this position for about 20 s before three measurements were made on each leg, with the subjects standing alternately on their right and left leg. The test order between legs was randomized. Accordingly, the assessment included three measurements taken on the right leg and three on the left leg, giving a total of six measurements on each test occasion. These six measurements lasted for approximately 3.5 minutes. If single-limb balance was not maintained for 25 seconds, the trial was not recorded and the measurement was repeated. However, all subjects in the present study successfully completed the measurements. Movements of the center of pressure (CP) in the frontal plane (FP) and sagittal plane (SP) were recorded for 25 s at a sampling frequency of 20 Hz. In bilateral stance, a frequency of CP below 1–3 Hz has been found in healthy subjects [ 22 ]. A center frequency value of CP below 2 Hz has been observed in single-limb stance in the frontal plane in uninjured subjects and in individuals with functional instability of the ankle [ 23 ]. We have found no reports on the frequency of CP in single-limb stance in the sagittal plane. However, according Winter [ 22 ] the frequency of CP is lower in the sagittal plane than in the frontal plane. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that a sampling frequency of 20 Hz is appropriate for measuring CP movements in single-limb stance. It cannot, however, be excluded that CP movements at higher frequencies than those that can be recorded at a sampling rate of 20 Hz may exist. A computer program (Viewdac 2.1, Keithley Instruments, Inc., Cleveland, Ohio, USA), was used to analyze the following variables: 1) standard deviation of the mean value of CP movements in mm, reflecting the amplitude of CP movements (amplitude); 2) average speed of CP movements in mm·s -1 ; 3) number of movements exceeding 5 mm from the mean value of CP (DEV 5); and 4) number of movements exceeding 10 mm from the mean value of CP (DEV 10) , giving a total of eight variables (four variables in each plane). The mean value of CP is the distance (mm) between the CP and the reference lines, and the amplitude (mm) is its standard deviation. The average speed (mm·s -1 ) reflects the amplitude and frequency of CP movements, and is calculated as the total length of the path of CP divided by the test trial time. DEV 5 is the number of movements exceeding 5 mm but less than or equal to 10 mm from the mean value of CP, and DEV 10 is the number of movements exceeding 10 mm from the mean value of CP. DEV 5 and DEV 10 reflect the amplitude of CP (i.e., displacement of CP). Figure 1 Stabilometry in single-limb stance, tested by means of a strain gauge force plate. A standardized position was used. The subject is a model who did not participate in the study. Full size image The subjects in group 1 were tested twice (test 1 and test 2), at about the same time of day with an interval of approximately one week, median value 7 days (range 4–7 days). As previously mentioned, three measurements were made on each leg. The median value of these three measurements was used in the test-retest reliability analyses. The subjects in group 2 were tested before (pre-exercise) and immediately after completion of short-duration, sub-maximal cycling (post-exercise). The median value of the three measurements and the first and third of the three post-exercise measurements were used in the analyses. Short-duration sub-maximal exercise (group 2 only) Short-duration, sub-maximal exercise was performed on a cycle ergometer. The subjects wore a heart-rate meter during the entire duration of the assessment. Borg\'s scale for Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) [ 24 ] was used to assess the subjective effort level during exercise. On this scale, numbers ranging from 6 to 20 are matched with descriptors (e.g., 6 = No exertion at all , 13 = Somewhat hard , 15 = Hard , 17 = Very hard , 19 = Extremely hard , and 20 = Maximal exertion ). The RPE scale was designed to increase linearly with exercise intensity and heart rate while exercising on a bicycle ergometer, and correlates closely with several physiological variables, including heart rate and blood lactate concentration [ 24 ]. A linear relationship exists between heart rate and oxygen consumption with increasing rates of work. A given percentage of maximum oxygen consumption (VO 2max ) results in a higher percentage of maximum heart rate (HR max ); e.g., 75% of VO 2max represents an intensity of 86% of the HR max [ 25 ]. HR max can be predicted from the following equation: Maximum heart rate (beats/min) = 220 - age (years) [ 25 ]. Reductions in concentrations of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and creatine phosphate (CP) in muscle, and large increases in muscle and blood lactate concentrations have been observed after a 4-min period of exercise on a cycle ergometer above 60% of VO 2max [ 20 ]. The rate of pedaling was kept constant at 60 revs/min. The level of exercise was calculated to be similar to that perceived during a general exercise session. Depending on the sex and physical condition of each subject, the workload (W) was set individually aiming at reaching a heart rate above 60% of the predicted HR max in all subjects. The cycling was stopped when the subjects had reached a heart rate exceeding 60% of the predicted HR max , perceived the exercise as hard or very hard (values of 14–17 on the RPE scale), and had reached steady-state heart rate; i.e., after approximately 5 min. The exercise on the stationary bicycle took place beside the force platform, so that the test after exercise could be commenced within 10 s. Statistical analysis Since no statistically significant difference was found between the right and left legs in the stabilometric variables, the average of the right and left legs; i.e., (right+left)/2, for each stabilometric variable was used for statistical analyses. The use of the mean value of both legs when performing parametric statistics can be questioned, since this may affect the data variability. It cannot, however, be excluded that a dominance of one or the other side exists, which is difficult to define [ 17 ], and therefore it is hard to determine which leg to use in comparison with patients. For this reason we used the average of the right and left legs. However, the results were confirmed using the right and left legs separately in the analyses. Test-retest reliability (group 1) A number of statistical methods of assessing test-retest reliability were used: 1) mean difference and 95% confidence interval (CI), 2) the two-way random effect model (absolute agreement definition), average measure ICC and 95% CI (ICC 2,2 according to Shrout & Fleiss [ 26 ]), and 3) the Bland and Altman method of assessing agreement, which includes a scatter plot of the differences between test 1 and test 2 against their mean with 95% limits of agreement (LOA) (i.e., mean difference ± 2 SD of the difference) [ 27 ]. Effects of exercise (group 2) The paired t-test was used for the intra-group comparisons. The median value of the three measurements was used to compare pre- and post-exercise values. In addition, the first and third of the post-exercise measurements were compared, to evaluate the instantaneous value of the ability to maintain postural control in single-limb stance (first measurement) and the possible recovery (third measurement). A level of P < 0.05 was chosen to indicate statistical significance. Since the present study has an exploratory character, no correction for multiple comparisons was made. The statistical analyses were performed using the program package SPSS 11.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Ill, USA). Results Test-retest reliability The mean (SD) for test sessions 1 and 2, mean difference with 95% CI, ICC values, and 95% LOA between test 1 and test 2, are given in Table 1 . ICC values between 0.79 and 0.95 were found in the stabilometric variables, except for the amplitude in the SP (ICC 0.47). The mean difference and 95% CI revealed no statistically significant difference between test 1 and test 2 (zero is included in each interval). Figures 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 and 9 show the differences between test sessions 1 and 2 (test 2 minus test 1) plotted against their mean for each subject with 95% CI and 95% LOA (see also Table 1 ). The variables in the FP tended to have smaller mean differences between the test sessions, higher ICC values, and narrower LOAs than the variables in the SP (Table 1 ).

The median power output produced by the subjects at the end of cycling was 150 W (range 100 to 200 W), and the mean value of perceived exertion, rated according to the RPE scale, was 15.4 (SD 0.9). The final heart rate attained was 159 beats/min (SD 14 beats/min), and the heart rate after the stabilometric assessment, approximately 3.5 minutes after the exercise, was 117 beats/min (SD 16 beats/min). Amplitude of CP movements No difference was found in the amplitude in the frontal plane (FP) between pre- and post-exercise values. In the sagittal plane (SP) the amplitude was higher post- than pre-exercise (P = 0.02). The mean (SD) for pre- and post-exercise values, mean difference with 95% CI (post-exercise minus pre-exercise), and P-values are given in Table 2 . Five (21%) subjects had a difference between pre- and post-exercise measurements in the FP outside the LOA, and in the SP, 2 (8%) subjects had a difference between the measurements outside the LOA. Analysis of the first and third of the post-exercise measurements showed no difference in the FP or SP (Table 3 ). Table 2 Effects of exercise in the stabilometric variables, in 24 healthy subjects.

Full size table Average speed of CP movements Higher values were observed post- than pre-exercise in average speed in the FP (P = 0.01), although not in the SP (Table 2 ). One (4%) subject and 3 (12.5%) subjects had a difference between pre- and post-exercise measurements outside the LOA in the FP and SP, respectively. No difference was observed between the first and third of the post-exercise measurements in the FP or SP (Table 3 ). Number of movements exceeding 5 mm from the mean value of CP No difference was noted between pre- and post-exercise values in DEV 5 in the FP or SP (Table 2 ). One (4%) subject and 2 (8%) subjects had a difference between pre- and post-exercise measurements outside the LOA in the FP and SP, respectively. No difference was observed between the first and third of the post-exercise measurements in the FP or SP (Table 3 ). Number of movements exceeding 10 mm from the mean value of CP Higher values were found in DEV 10 post- than pre-exercise in the FP (p = 0.03), however, not in the SP (Table 2 ). One (4%) subject had a difference between pre- and post-exercise measurements in the FP outside the LOA. In the SP, none of the subjects had a difference between the measurements outside the LOA. No difference was observed between the first and third of the post-exercise measurements in the FP or SP (Table 3 ). Discussion We have previously reported high reproducibility in healthy subjects for the platform described [ 16 ]. However, in that study only the ICC, which is difficult to interpret clinically, was used to assess test-retest reliability. In addition, a systematic error was observed after previous studies, and the platform has therefore been calibrated. For these reasons, a new, extended test-retest reliability study was conducted. According to the recommendations of Fleiss [ 28 ], ICC values above 0.75 represent excellent reliability, while values between 0.4 and 0.75 represent good reliability. All variables, except the amplitude in the SP, showed ICC values above 0.75, which is in accordance with our previous study [ 16 ] and those of others [ 14 , 15 ]. Visual analysis of the Bland and Altman graphs and interpretation of the mean difference and 95% CI between the two test sessions, showed that the values tended to be lower in test session 2, which may be interpreted as a learning process. This tendency was, however, not significant as zero was included in the 95% CI (Table 1 and Figures 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 and 9 ). To evaluate changes over time in an individual, the magnitude of the change must exceed the inherent variability of the outcome. The LOA can be used to assess a ""real"" change in an individual\'s performance as a result of intervention; i.e., if the difference between two measurements is outside the LOA, there is a true change in performance [ 13 ]. Since the LOAs were rather wide, the test of balance in single-limb stance we used cannot detect small changes in an individual\'s performance. In the second part of the study, few subjects (0 – 5) had a difference between the pre- and post-exercise measurements outside the LOAs, i.e., a ""real"" change in their individual performance. Most subjects had a difference between the measurements within the LOAs, which does not represent a ""real"" change in their individual performance. This result confirms that small changes in an individual\'s performance cannot be detected. Relatively large individual measurement errors for balance in single-limb stance measured on a force platform have also been reported by Birmingham [ 14 ]. In that study, SEMs and 95% CIs were used as measures of absolute reliability, and the results showed that large changes could be detected, but not small changes, in an individual\'s score [ 14 ]. The test of balance in single-limb stance we used may be more useful and appropriate when distinguishing between groups of subjects, such as between patients and controls. To evaluate an individual\'s change in balance performance, a ""true"" change would be outside the LOAs. The tendency towards smaller mean differences between the two test sessions, higher ICC values, and narrower LOAs for the variables in the FP than in the SP, indicates that the variables in the FP may be more reliable. The second aim of our study was to study the effect of short-duration, sub-maximal general exercise on balance in single-limb stance in healthy subjects. The results revealed higher values post- than pre-exercise in three of the eight measured variables; i.e., the amplitude in the SP, and the average speed and DEV 10 in the FP, whereas the other five variables were unaffected by exercise. In contrast to these higher values found after cycling, all variables tended to have lower values in test session two in the test-retest reliability part of the study. The results of higher values after exercise are supported by the findings of other studies [ 6 – 8 ]. The findings of these studies and our results seem, however, to contradict those of three studies, showing no effect of fatiguing exercise on balance standing on one leg [ 9 – 11 ]. Adlerton & Moritz [ 10 ] used the same force platform as that used in our study. However, their fatiguing protocol was different from ours; a local fatiguing protocol involving requesting the subjects to rise on tiptoe repeatedly, which may explain the divergent results. Rozzi et al. [ 11 ] suggested that the platform they used had sensitivity too low to detect the effects of muscular fatigue. In the third study mentioned [ 9 ], the extent or level of fatigue was not described, which makes it difficult to compare the results with those of other studies. To evaluate the possible recovery period, the first and third of the post-exercise measurements were compared. It was assumed that the first measurement could provide us with the instantaneous value of the ability to maintain postural control in single-limb stance. No difference was found between the first and third of the measurements, which indicates that the initial ability to maintain balance was not more affected by exercise than the final measurement. We used general exercise on an ergometer cycle, in order to resemble physical activity, with the aim of fatiguing the subjects to the same extent as that perceived during a general exercise session. All subjects in our study exceeded 60% of the predicted HR max value; the values ranging from 68% to 99%. Since a given percentage of VO 2max results in a higher percentage of HR max [ 25 ], and since the mean value of the predicted HR max was 81%, it may be assumed that the subjects had reached a value above 60% of the predicted VO 2max ; the level above which effects of fatigue have been observed after cycling for a period of four minutes [ 20 ]. A short recovery time could be assumed in people with good physical condition, and to avoid recovery, the exercise on the stationary bicycle therefore took place beside the force platform, so that the test after exercise could be commenced within 10 s. Walking or running on a treadmill could not take place beside the force platform, and was therefore impractical. In addition, we plan to study the effect of general exercise in individuals with knee injuries at different times after injury, and since the knee is loaded considerably more while running/walking than cycling, cycling was selected due to ethical reasons. We found that short-term, sub-maximal cycling had an effect on balance in single-limb stance. It is, however, possible that larger effects may be seen after running or walking than after cycling. This has been reported in studies assessing postural control while standing on both feet [ 4 , 5 ], indicating that increased loading on the lower extremities affects standing balance to a greater extent. Different methods of inducing fatigue by loading the lower extremities, as well as the effect of general exercise on balancing on one leg after longer durations of exercise than in the present study, need to be further investigated. To our knowledge, no data is available as to which variables provide the best measure of postural control in single-limb stance. In a previous study on healthy subjects, we reported differences due to age in average speed in the FP and between men and women in both the FP and SP [ 17 ]. Amplitude and DEV 10 have been found to be higher among patients with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury compared to a control group of healthy subjects [ 18 ]. In that study, CP movements in the FP only were recorded [ 18 ]. In the present study, effects of exercise were observed for two variables in the FP (average speed and DEV 10) and one (amplitude) in the SP. Although the amplitude in the SP was able to detect hypothesized changes after the exercise, we recommend that the amplitude variable not be used in future studies, since DEV 10 and amplitude both measure the amplitude of CP movements, and since the amplitude had poorer reliability in the SP than DEV 10 and was unaffected by exercise in the FP. DEV 5 did not add any information in the present study or in a previous one [ 18 ], and can therefore also be excluded in future studies. The results of our previous studies and the present one indicate that measurements in the FP may be more sensitive and revealing than those in the SP. Furthermore, measurements in the FP may be more useful since it is more difficult to maintain the center of mass within the narrow width of the base of support in this plane [ 29 ] than in the SP. The changes in balance in single-limb stance found after exercise in the present study may be explained by several factors. Motor control encompasses the control of posture, balance, and movement. It is dependent on afferent information from muscle spindles, receptors located in joint structures, muscles, tendons, and skin, visual and vestibular information, as well as voluntary and reflexive muscular response [ 30 ]. The activity of joint receptors, muscle spindles and Golgi tendon organs may be reduced by fatigue, resulting in proprioceptive deficit in muscle receptors and loss of muscular reflexes responsible for dynamic joint stability [ 31 ]. Since this afferent information is also important for the maintenance of postural control [ 30 ], the decreased muscle response may lead to a poorer ability to maintain balance. Besides the effects of fatigue on standing balance, some studies have also reported increased knee joint laxity [ 9 , 32 , 33 ], decreased knee proprioception [ 11 , 34 ], and a delay in muscle response [ 33 ] following fatiguing exercise. The increased amplitude of CP movements observed after cycling in the present study may be explained by a decrease in muscle response and a delay in muscle reaction, and this larger sway may also explain the increased average speed. These increased values in stabilometry following exercise indicate compensatory mechanisms intended to maintain balance in single-limb stance, or a decreased ability to maintain balance. Conclusions No statistically significant bias between the two test sessions was found. The ICCs ranged from 0.79 to 0.95 in all stabilometric variables except one. The Bland and Altman plots with LOA revealed that small changes in an individual\'s performance cannot be detected. A relatively large difference in an individual\'s balance performance would be required to confidently state that the change is real. The stabilometric test may thus be more useful and appropriate for distinguishing between groups of subjects. The increased values of average speed and DEV 10 in the FP, and of the amplitude in the SP following cycling for a short period of time at a sub-maximal level, indicate compensatory mechanisms aimed at maintaining balance in single-limb stance, or a decreased ability to maintain balance, in young healthy subjects. Since the amplitude in the SP had poor reliability, and DEV 5 in both planes and amplitude in the FP were unaffected by exercise, these variables can be excluded in future studies. We recommend that average speed and DEV 10; the variables showing the best reliability and effects of exercise, be used in future studies. Our results indicate that measurements in the FP may be more reliable and sensitive than those in the SP.

The symptoms of pain, morning stiffness of short duration and physical dysfunction in the activities of daily living (ADL) can have an effect on many aspects of health, affecting quality of life. Regular and moderate physical activity adapted to individuals' life-styles and education, and joint protection strategies have been advocated as conservative management. The purpose of the present study was to assess the impact of an exercise and walking protocol on the quality of life of elderly people with knee OA. Method The study design was a randomized controlled clinical trial. The subjects comprised 50 elderly people, aged 65 or more, with knee OA who had been referred to the geriatric outpatient unit for rehabilitation. Changes in severity of pain and quality of life were compared between a control group (CG) and an experimental group (EG). Both groups participated in an educational session and the EG also received a 12-week exercise and walking protocol. Both groups were assessed at baseline and after three and six months by an independent observer. The Lequesne Index of Knee OA Severity (LI), the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) and the Medical Outcomes Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) were used as measurement instruments. Results In the CG, the measures of quality of life (SF-36), the HAQ and the LI between subjects did not yield statistically significant differences over the three measurement points. For the EG, there was a significant improvement in function, measured by HAQ, and decreasing OA symptom severity, measured by LI. For the SF-36 there were significant improvements in physical function, functional role limitation and pain. Comparisons between the groups showed statistically significant differences after three and six months for all measures, except for the SF-36 emotional domains. Conclusion The exercise protocol and walking programme had a positive effect on the quality of life of elderly individuals with knee OA. Copyright © 2003 Whurr Publishers Ltd. REFERENCES Altman RD .

Exercise snacks are an emerging form of physical activity characterized by shorter single bouts of high-intensity exercise spread out repeatedly throughout the day which can provide more exercise opportunities for middle-aged and older adults. Purpose To summarize perceptions and experiences of exercise snacks among middle-aged and older adults, and explore the barriers and facilitators of promoting exercise snacks. Methods We followed the PRISMA and systematically searched five databases from the earliest to May 2024. The Critical Appraisal Skills Program tool is used to quality assess and the Capability, Opportunity, and Motivation Model of Behavior (COM-B model) is used to guide thematic synthesis. Results Fourteen categories from nine studies were summarized, and 277 findings were identified. Three synthesized findings were: capability of middle-aged and older adults (including health-related exercise disorders, learning and mastery skills, and health literacy), opportunities for exercise snacks (including flexible and free, easy and quick, integration into life, social and family support, and application of mobile health technology), and motivation of exercise snacks (including pleasurable experiences, gaining physical and mental benefits, effective reminders, incentives and feedback, personalized needs, and self-efficacy). Conclusion Exercise snacks are a promising approach， however, they need to be continuously optimized. Our results can provide evidence for designing and optimizing exercise snack programs. Medical workers should assist middle-aged and older adults in developing appropriate exercise snack strategies.

There has not been a direct comparison of the 2 strategies with energy expenditure held constant. The purpose of this study was to compare fasting and postmeal glucose and insulin concentrations in response to a day with frequent breaks from sitting but no exercise versus considerable sitting plus moderate exercise. Ten sedentary overweight/obese office workers were tested in 3 conditions: ( i ) walking per activity guidelines (AGW): sitting for majority of workday with a 30 min pre-lunch walk; ( ii ) frequent long breaks (FLB): no structured exercise but frequent breaks from sitting during workday with energy expenditure matched to AGW; and ( iii ) frequent short breaks (FSB): number of breaks matched to FLB, but duration of breaks were shorter. Plasma glucose and insulin areas under the curve were measured in response to a meal tolerance test (MTT) at the end of the workday and interstitial glucose was evaluated throughout the day and overnight using continuous glucose monitoring. Using repeated-measures linear mixed models, area under the curve of plasma glucose or insulin after the MTT was not different between conditions. Glycemic variability was lower in FLB compared with AGW ( p < 0.05), and nocturnal duration of elevated glucose (>7.8 mmol/L) was shorter after FLB (2.5 ± 2.5 min) than AGW (32.7 ± 16.4 min) or FSB (45.6 ± 29.6 min, p = 0.05). When energy expenditure was matched, breaks from sitting approximated the effects of moderate-intensity exercise on postmeal glucose and insulin responses and more effectively constrained glycemic variability. Résumé D’après de récentes données probantes, la diminution du temps passé assis pourrait améliorer, tout comme l’ajout d’exercice physique, la santé cardiométabolique. Il n’y a pas d’études de comparaison directe des deux stratégies pour une même dépense d’énergie. Cette étude se propose de comparer les concentrations d’insuline et de glucose à jeun et à la suite d’un repas en réponse à de fréquentes pauses de la position assise et sans exercice à beaucoup de temps passé assis à l’ajout d’exercice d’intensité modérée. On évalue dix employés de bureau sédentaires présentant un surpoids ou de l’obésité dans trois conditions : ( i ) en marchant conformément aux directives en matière d’activité physique (« AGW ») : en restant assis durant la majeure partie du temps de travail et en marchant durant 30 min avant le repas du midi, ( ii ) nombreuses pauses prolongées (« FLB ») : pas d’exercice structuré, mais des pauses fréquentes de la position assise durant le temps de travail tout en appariant la dépense d’énergie à la condition AGW et ( iii ) nombreuses pauses brèves (« FSB ») : nombre de pauses apparié à la condition FLB, mais la durée des pauses est plus brève. On mesure la surface sous la courbe de la concentration plasmatique de glucose et d’insuline en réponse à un test de tolérance au repas (« MTT ») à la fin de la journée de travail et on évalue la concentration interstitielle de glucose tout au long de la journée et durant la nuit par une surveillance continue de la glycémie. D’après des modèles linéaires mixtes de mesures répétées, la surface sous la courbe du glucose et de l’insuline plasmatique suivant le MTT ne diffère pas d’une condition à l’autre. La variation de la glycémie est plus faible dans la condition FLB comparativement à la condition AGW ( p < 0,05) et la durée nocturne de la hausse de glycémie (>7,8 mmol/L) est plus brève après FLB (2,5 ± 2,5 min) qu’après AGW (32,7 ± 16,4 min) et FSB (45,6 ± 29,6 min, p = 0,05). Lorsque la dépense d’énergie est appariée, les pauses de la position assise suscitent à peu près les mêmes effets que l’exercice d’intensité modérée sur la concentration postprandiale de glucose et d’insuline et limitent plus efficacement la variation de la glycémie.

As a personal trainer in San Mateo, I’ve seen countless clients struggle with this balancing act. But here’s the good news: it’s not only possible to stay fit while managing a hectic schedule, it’s also crucial for your overall well-being and success. At Holly Roser Fitness , we understand the unique challenges faced by busy professionals, parents, and individuals trying to prioritize their health. In this blog, we’ll explore evidence-based strategies and practical tips to help you integrate fitness into your packed schedule without sacrificing your other commitments or burning out. Whether you’re a seasoned gym-goer or just starting your fitness journey, these insights will help you make the most of your limited time and energy. So, let’s dive in and discover how to make fitness a seamless part of your busy life! Understanding the Importance of Balance Before we jump into the practical tips, it’s crucial to understand why balancing fitness with a busy life is so important. The Health Imperative Research has consistently shown that regular physical activity is essential for both physical and mental health. A study published in the Lancet found that individuals who engaged in regular physical activity had a 20-30% lower risk of premature death and various chronic diseases compared to those who were inactive. The Productivity Boost Contrary to what you might think, taking time for fitness can actually make you more productive in other areas of your life. A study in the Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine revealed that employees who participated in a workplace fitness program showed improved job performance and reduced absenteeism. Taking time for fitness doesn’t just improve your health – it can boost your productivity in all areas of life. Efficient Workout Strategies for Busy People When time is at a premium, efficiency is key. Here are some strategies to maximize your workout results in minimal time: High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) HIIT has gained popularity for good reason. This form of exercise alternates short bursts of intense activity with periods of rest or lower-intensity exercise. A study in the Journal of Physiology found that just 2.5 hours of HIIT per week can lead to similar physiological changes as 10.5 hours of moderate continuous exercise. Try this: A 20-minute HIIT workout alternating 30 seconds of all-out effort (like sprinting or burpees) with 30 seconds of rest. Compound Exercises Compound exercises work multiple muscle groups simultaneously, giving you more bang for your buck. Examples include squats, deadlifts, and push-ups. Research in the Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research has shown that compound exercises elicit greater hormonal responses, potentially leading to increased muscle growth and fat loss. Try this: A quick circuit of squats, push-ups, and rows, performing each exercise for 45 seconds with 15 seconds rest between. Micro-Workouts Don’t have a solid 30-minute block? No problem. Breaking your workout into smaller chunks throughout the day can be just as effective. A study in the journal Obesity found that multiple short bouts of exercise (10 minutes each) were as effective for weight loss as one continuous 30-minute session. Try this: Three 10-minute sessions spread throughout your day, focusing on bodyweight exercises or a brisk walk. Smart Scheduling: Making Time for Fitness Now that we have efficient workout strategies, let’s look at how to fit them into your busy schedule: The Power of Morning Workouts While the best time to exercise is whenever you can consistently do it, morning workouts have some unique benefits. A study in the British Journal of Nutrition found that exercising in a fasted state (like first thing in the morning) led to greater fat oxidation during the workout. Moreover, morning workouts can set a positive tone for the day and ensure that your workout doesn’t get pushed aside by unexpected events. Lunch Break Fitness If mornings aren’t your thing, consider using your lunch break for a quick workout. Not only does this break up your workday, but it can also boost your afternoon productivity. A study in the Scandinavian Journal of Medicine & Science in Sports found that lunchtime workouts improved mood and performance in the afternoon. Habit Stacking Habit stacking is a powerful technique where you pair a new habit (like exercise) with an existing one. For instance, you might do a set of squats while brushing your teeth or planks during commercial breaks while watching TV. At Holly Roser Fitness , we work with clients to identify these opportunities in their daily routines, making fitness a natural part of their day rather than an additional task. Nutrition Strategies for the Time-Crunched Fitness isn’t just about exercise – nutrition plays a crucial role. Here are some strategies to maintain a healthy diet when time is tight: Meal Prep Mastery Spending a few hours on the weekend to prep meals for the week can save you time and ensure you’re eating nutritious foods. A study in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine found that spending more time on food preparation was associated with higher diet quality. Try this: Prep a large batch of lean protein (like grilled chicken), whole grains, and chopped vegetables. Mix and match these throughout the week for quick, balanced meals. Smart Snacking Keep healthy snacks readily available to avoid reaching for less nutritious options when hunger strikes. Nuts, Greek yogurt, and fruit are great options. Research in the journal Nutrients has shown that strategically timed protein-rich snacks can help with appetite control and muscle maintenance. Hydration Hacks Don’t forget about hydration! Keeping a reusable water bottle with you and setting reminders can help ensure you’re drinking enough throughout the day. Proper hydration is crucial for exercise performance and recovery, as well as overall health. Remember: Staying hydrated is just as important as eating well and exercising regularly. Mindset Matters: Psychological Strategies for Success Balancing fitness and a busy life isn’t just about physical strategies – your mindset plays a crucial role too. The Power of Mindfulness Incorporating mindfulness techniques can help you stay focused and reduce stress, making it easier to stick to your fitness goals. A study in the Journal of Health Psychology found that mindfulness was associated with better adherence to health-related behaviors, including physical activity. Try this: Start your day with a 5-minute mindfulness meditation, focusing on your breath and setting intentions for the day. Reframing “No Time” Often, when we say we have “no time” for exercise, what we really mean is that it’s not a priority. Try reframing this thought. Instead of “I don’t have time to exercise,” try “Fitness is important to me, so I’m choosing to make time for it.” Celebrating Small Wins Remember, every step counts. Celebrate the small victories, like choosing to take the stairs instead of the elevator or fitting in a 10-minute workout on a busy day. These small wins can help build momentum and motivation. At Holly Roser Fitness, we believe in the power of positive reinforcement. Our clients are encouraged to track their progress and celebrate their achievements, no matter how small they might seem. Leveraging Technology for Fitness Success In our digital age, technology can be a powerful ally in your fitness journey. Fitness Apps and Wearables Fitness apps and wearables can help you track your activity, set reminders, and stay motivated. A systematic review published in the Journal of Medical Internet Research found that the use of fitness apps was associated with increased physical activity. Virtual Workouts Can’t make it to the gym? No problem. At Holly Roser Fitness we offer Virtual workouts , live-trainer guided workouts that bring expert coaching right to your living room. During the COVID-19 pandemic, many people discovered the convenience and effectiveness of home workouts, and this trend is likely to continue. Smart Home Gym Equipment For those who can invest a bit more, smart home gym equipment can provide a gym-quality workout experience at home. Many of these come with virtual classes and personalized coaching, making it easier to fit in effective workouts on your own schedule. The Importance of Recovery and Sleep In the quest to balance fitness and a busy life, it’s crucial not to overlook recovery and sleep. Quality Sleep for Better Fitness Adequate sleep is essential for both physical recovery and mental sharpness. A study in the journal Sleep found that getting enough quality sleep was associated with better exercise performance and lower risk of injury. Try this: Establish a consistent sleep schedule, aiming for 7-9 hours per night. Create a relaxing bedtime routine to help wind down. Active Recovery On days when you can’t fit in a full workout, consider active recovery. This might include light yoga, stretching, or a leisurely walk. These activities can help maintain your fitness routine, reduce stress, and prevent burnout. Stress Management Managing stress is crucial for overall health and can make it easier to stick to your fitness goals. Techniques like deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, or even a quick meditation can be done anywhere and take just a few minutes. Making Fitness a Family Affair For those with family commitments, involving your loved ones in your fitness journey can be a great way to spend quality time together while staying active. Family Workout Ideas Try family bike rides, hikes, or even creating an obstacle course in your backyard. Not only does this help you stay active, but it also sets a positive example for your children. Research has shown that parental physical activity levels are strongly associated with children’s activity levels. Active Date Nights Instead of the traditional dinner and a movie, why not try an active date night? Go dancing, try a new sport together, or take a couples’ fitness class. This can be a fun way to bond while staying fit. Workplace Wellness Given that many of us spend a significant portion of our day at work, incorporating fitness into your work routine can be a game-changer. Stand-Up Desks and Walking Meetings Consider using a stand-up desk or taking walking meetings. A study in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health found that using a stand-up desk can increase energy expenditure and may have positive effects on health. Office Exercises Simple exercises like desk push-ups, chair squats, or calf raises can be done right at your workstation. Even short bursts of activity throughout the day can add up and contribute to your overall fitness.

These lifestyle interventions allow a person to individualize his/her physical activity programs to include a wide variety of activities that are at least of moderate intensity and to accumulate bouts of these activities in a manner befitting his/her life circumstances. Methods: We reviewed the history of lifestyle physical activity interventions and defined lifestyle physical activity based on this review. We located 14 studies that met this definition. Results: Lifestyle physical activity interventions are effective at increasing and maintaining levels of physical activity that meet or exceed public health guidelines for physical activity in representative samples of previously sedentary adults and obese children. The majority of these interventions have been delivered by face-to-face contact in small groups, which limits their public health impact. However, a small number of studies demonstrate that these interventions can be delivered by mail and telephone, which may enhance their generalizability. Most of these studies utilized behavior change theories such as Social Cognitive Theory, the Transtheoretical Model, and Behavior Learning to shape the interventions. Lifestyle interventions aimed at modifying the environment, such as signs posted to increase stair climbing, also have been shown to be effective over the short term. Conclusions: The major issues concerning lifestyle physical activity interventions are: (1) testing their ability to be implemented on a large scale; (2) examining cost-effectiveness for different modes of delivery; and (3) researching the efficacy in populations such as the elderly, minorities, economically disadvantaged, and individuals with concurrent disease. More studies aimed at manipulating the environment to increase physical activity need to be tested over periods of one year or longer. It is possible that lifestyle interventions could be integrated and delivered by new technologies such as interactive computer-mediated programs, telephone, or computer web-based formats. All of these recommended approaches should utilize valid and reliable measures of physical activity and should examine the health effects, particularly on a longitudinal basis. Basic dose-response studies in controlled settings also are needed to help us understand the health effects of accumulated moderate intensity activity. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords exercise behavior psychological theory public health motivation review In the J.B. Wolffe Memorial Lecture presented at the 1993 American College of Sports Medicine annual meeting, Dr. William Haskell spoke of shifting the “Exercise Training–Physical Fitness” paradigm to include the “Physical Activity Health” paradigm because of the growing number of scientific studies demonstrating reduced morbidity resulting from increasing moderate amounts and intensities of physical activity. 1 Lifestyle physical activity interventions represent a part of this expansion toward public health interventions that focus on increasing moderate intensity activity while attempting to take into account individual, cultural, and environmental differences. This approach provides opportunities and options for tailoring physical activities to individuals regardless of their current lifestyle, and is aimed at individuals who are inactive or inadequately active. Since this 1993 lecture, a shift to include a physical activity health paradigm is indeed occurring and lifestyle physical activity interventions are a manifestation of this broadened public health focus. The process of paradigm shifts has been detailed by Kuhn, who states that new paradigms emerge through the confluence of three different pathways: (1) through crisis, (2) from re-examination of ground that has already been covered, and (3) from findings that do not fit the current paradigm. 2 In this paper, we will use Kuhn’s framework and trace the scientific evidence that underlies the emergence of lifestyle physical activity interventions. We also will provide a definition of lifestyle physical activity. We will review the lifestyle physical activity interventions that meet this definition and what we know about their efficacy, cost-effectiveness, generalizability to subgroups, and ability to maintain behavior over the long term. Finally, we will draw some overall conclusions about what we can surmise from this existing evidence and offer recommendations for further scientific studies and practice. The emergence of lifestyle physical activity The history of lifestyle physical activity interventions is closely linked with the history of public health recommendations for physical activity such as those from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM), 3 the National Institutes of Health Consensus panel, 4 and the Surgeon General’s recommendations for physical activity and health. 5 Lifestyle physical activity shares the same scientific foundation as these recommendations; however, there also are converging data on the benefits of lifestyle physical activity from other fields (e.g., behavioral medicine) and other specializations (e.g., obesity research). These fields have not directly influenced the public health recommendations for physical activity but they have played a meaningful role in the conception of lifestyle physical activity interventions. Using Kuhn’s framework, 2 we will illustrate the overlap as well as the divergence of lifestyle physical activity from public health recommendations. Prior to this review, we offer the following definition of lifestyle physical activity. Definition of lifestyle physical activity Studies examining the adoption and maintenance of lifestyle physical activity have been conceptualized and operationalized in different ways, such as increasing light and moderate intensity activities, increasing leisure time activities, or decreasing sedentary activity. Some also vaguely defined all types of physical activity and exercise under the broad general category of lifestyle, which might include other targets for intervention such as smoking, seat belt use, and diet. 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 Because of these varied conceptualizations, it is important to define lifestyle physical activity within the context of this paper. We draw heavily from the studies of Epstein and colleagues, 10 , 11 the conceptual papers by Blair and coworkers 12 , 13 and Dietz and colleagues, 14 and public health guidelines (i.e., the Surgeon General’s Report on Physical Activity and Health 5 ) to define lifestyle physical activity as follows. Lifestyle physical activity is the daily accumulation of at least 30 minutes of self-selected activities, which includes all leisure, occupational, or household activities that are at least moderate to vigorous in their intensity and could be planned or unplanned activities that are part of everyday life. A critical point in this definition is that these are activities that the individual selects and are not prescribed. Also, these self-selected activities can be consciously planned by the individual or they can be unplanned by manipulation of the environment, such as signs suggesting that individuals climb stairs instead of using escalators. As the conceptual drawing of Figure 1 suggests, lifestyle activities can be accumulated in short bouts during the day rather than performed in one long bout of continuous activity. Lifestyle physical activity has been facilitated through the use of various behavioral strategies or environmental cues that shape sedentary or inadequately active individuals to reduce sedentary activities and to achieve or surpass minimum public health guidelines for physical activity.

Reproduced from Blair et al. with permission of Blackwell Scientific. 13 The emergence of lifestyle physical activity interventions Using Kuhn’s model, 2 we believe lifestyle physical activity interventions have evolved through the following pathways of crisis and re-examination of the scientific evidence and findings that broaden the current exercise-training paradigm. Crisis Crisis in science occurs because of repeated failure to solve a problem. 2 The term crisis might be hyperbole in this case, but it would not be an understatement to say that physical inactivity is a serious public health problem that has prompted the consideration of lifestyle physical activity as a method of encouraging sedentary individuals to become more active. This problem has been identified through both epidemiologic studies and investigations of determinants of physical activity. First, epidemiology studies demonstrate that only 15% of the population are vigorously active at the levels prescribed by the American College of Sports Medicine. 5 , 15 Similarly a large majority, 60%, of the population is inadequately active and of these, 25% are completely inactive. 5 This evidence, along with important reviews on determinants and barriers to exercise, 16 , 17 , 18 indicate that many people feel that they do not have time to exercise, 19 , 20 , 21 dislike vigorous exercise, 22 and dislike the imposed conformity of gymnasium-based exercise. 18 From this evidence, public health researchers surmised that most people were not exercising at the amounts prescribed by the ACSM Exercise Prescription guidelines 15 because of a misperception that vigorous exercise was their only alternative. 3 A re-examination of the scientific evidence In the early 1990s, physical inactivity was recognized as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease 23 when population-based studies consistently showed that physical activity or physical fitness reduced the risk of cardiovascular disease in a dose-response manner. Persons who reported the highest levels of physical activity or fitness had the lowest risk, but those who were performing moderate amounts of activity or who were moderately fit also had large and significant reductions in risk from all-cause mortality and cardiovascular disease. These studies are comprehensively reviewed elsewhere 5 , 24 and will not be reviewed here. Briefly, to highlight some of the epidemiologic findings, Morris et al. published one of the earliest studies in 1958 on the relation of occupational activity to mortality in workers in Great Britain. 25 These results have been confirmed in similar studies conducted by Paffenbarger et al. 26 and Leon et al. 27 in populations in the United States, and by Magnus and colleagues who found a significant inverse relation between habitual walking, cycling, and gardening with myocardial infarction in a population in The Netherlands. 28 However, it was not until two decades later that evidence had accumulated to demonstrate that moderate amounts and intensities of physical activity could have important health benefits. 3 , 5 , 24 Also at this time, exercise scientists were reviewing the scientific evidence that formed the basis of exercise prescription guidelines 1 , 29 in terms of frequency, intensity, and duration. These reviews found that moderate intensities of activity resulted in modest improvements in fitness, 30 , 31 reduced elevated blood pressure, 32 and increased HDL-C cholesterol. 33 This evidence led exercise scientists to question the notion that exercise intensity had to be ≥60% of age-predicted maximal heart rate range to have health benefits. (See Blair and Connelly for a more complete review of this evidence. 29 ) Many consensus statements now conclude that physical activity performed at 40%–50% of age-predicted maximal heart rate range could also be beneficial for sedentary adults, persons with disabilities, and older adults. 3 , 4 , 5 Findings that do not fit the exercise-prescription paradigm In addition to studies that raised questions concerning the threshold of exercise intensity necessary for changes in fitness and other health-related indices, other more recent experimental studies have prompted a re-evaluation of the minimum thresholds of exercise duration to confer health benefits. For example, a study by DeBusk et al. 34 demonstrated several short bouts (e.g., 3 × 10-min bouts) had a comparable effect in improving health-related outcomes (e.g., resting heart rate and weight) as one long bout (e.g., 1 × 30 min bout) of exercise. Another study by Ebisu 35 showed that splitting the same total amount of exercise into 3 shorter sessions as compared with 1 or 2 session(s) resulted in similar improvements in fitness and significantly greater improvements in HDL-cholesterol. Table 1 details the results of studies that have contributed to the conceptual development of lifestyle physical activity interventions. These studies opened the door for studies examining the effects of splitting exercise bouts into several shorter sessions compared with one long continuous bout. These intermittent-exercise approaches have been conducted primarily in obese individuals and form a crucial middle ground between traditional continuous-exercise prescription approaches and lifestyle approaches to physical activity. For example, the studies by Jakicic and colleagues 36 , 37 show improvements in exercise adherence with 3 to 4 short 10-min bouts of moderate exercise compared with one 30- to 40-min bout of continuous exercise. Obese women assigned to intermittent exercise also showed similar improvements in fitness and a slightly greater weight loss compared with women in the continuous exercise condition. Studies with smaller sample sizes show similar effects of intermittent exercise on exercise adherence and trends toward improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness, loss of fat weight, and improved insulin. 38 , 39 These studies have been conducted up to 32 weeks, but longer-term studies are needed to determine maintenance effects of these types of intermittent interventions. Discoveries from other areas of research also played an important role in the conceptualization of lifestyle activity. For example, studies by King and colleagues examining home-based versus group-based structured exercise showed higher adherence rates in those performing home-based exercise at one year, and that high intensity home-based exercisers had higher adherence at the end of two years. 40 , 41 Both home-based and intermittent approaches were still prescriptive in terms of structuring the recommended types of activities and intensity of activity. However, they did address important barriers that had not been addressed before; thus, they opened the door to lifestyle approaches that allow even greater flexibility with regard to selection of activities and choice in whether activity is accumulated or continuous. Studies by Epstein and colleagues testing lifestyle versus structured aerobic exercise as an adjunct to a dietary intervention in obese children found higher maintenance of weight loss over a 17-month period in the lifestyle group compared with the structured aerobic group. 10 , 11 During the same time, conceptual papers advocating that short bouts of moderate-intensity activity be integrated into daily routines and decreased time spent in inactivity were published as a lifestyle approach to increasing physical activity. 13 , 14 These reports suggest that exercise could take place where people lived and that many types of activity might “count” over the course of daily life. 19 Additional research conducted by Sallis and colleagues 22 , 42 , 43 and Marcus and colleagues 44 , 45 also demonstrates the use of psychological theories and integrated behavioral skill building as part of the intervention approaches. Theoretical models of behavior change have become central to the development of successful lifestyle physical activity interventions. The earliest examples by Epstein utilized operant methods such as self-monitoring, goal setting, and positive reinforcement to reduce sedentary activities and increase physical activity in obese children. 11 Among lifestyle physical activity interventions in adults, Leaf and Reuben 46 have used similar goal-setting and self-monitoring methods. However, other researchers such as Andersen and colleagues 47 used Social Cognitive theory 48 to enhance self-efficacy and facilitate long-term adherence. Still other researchers 36 , 49 , 50 combined elements of Social Cognitive, Stages of Motivational Readiness, 51 and Relapse Prevention theories. 52 It was the synthesis of these findings from exercise, behavioral, and obesity research that led to studies comparing lifestyle physical activity with traditional structured exercise. At the same time, the emphasis shifted from weight and cardiovascular disease risk factors to an examination of differences in adherence rates, modes of physical activity, and cardiorespiratory fitness as primary rather than secondary outcomes.

Selected studies and papers contributing to conceptual development of lifestyle physical activity interventions legend , legend Reference Study design and results Conceptual contribution Epidemiology studies Magnus et al. 28a Case-control study of 473 cases and 875 referents of men aged 35–69 years. Habitual walking, cycling, and gardening (at least one-half hour each day) showed a 55% reduction in acute coronary events. One of first studies to demonstrate association of lifestyle physical activity with reduced risk of heart attack Morris et al. 25a 9,376 male civil service workers followed over 9 years for fatal coronary disease. Those who reported fast walking (3-4 mph) had significantly reduced rate, but those who reported brisk walking also had a lowered risk. One of first epidemiology studies to show a dose-response relation of intensity of physical activity and mortality Paffenbarger et al. 74a Prospective study (8 years) of 11,269 Harvard alumni who responded to questionnaires. Men who adopted a moderately vigorous lifestyle had 23% reduction in death. Men whose activity decreased had a 15% increased risk of mortality. Demonstrated that modifying activity can improve mortality in the previously unfit Blair et al. 75a Prospective study (5.1 years) of 9,777 men given 2 medical exams at followup. Men who improved from unfit to fit by increasing physical activity by moderate amounts and intensities had a 44% reduction in mortality risk. Those who increased their activity by performing more vigorous activity decreased their risk even further. Persons who are sedentary and unfit can improve mortality outcome by performing moderate-intensity activity in moderate amounts such as that recommended by recent public health statements Experimental studies Ebisu 35 Randomized controlled trial of supervised exercise performed 3 days/week at 80% maximal heart rate in 1 of 4 conditions: (1) 1 bout/day; (2) 2 bouts/day; (3) 3 bouts/day each working up to 6 miles; and (4) no exercise control. All exercise conditions resulted in improvements in functional aerobic capacity; HDL increased significantly only in the group performing 3 exercise bouts/day. Splitting exercise sessions could improve fitness, but have differential effects on health-related outcomes Epstein et al. 53 Randomized trial to test vigorous exercise plus diet with lifestyle plus diet and calisthenics plus diet in 35 obese children. Children in the lifestyle group maintained weight loss over 2 years. First randomized clinical trial of a lifestyle approach on health-related outcomes DeBusk et al. 34 Randomized trials examining 40 healthy men randomized to an 8-week program of performing vigorous exercise 5 days a week in 30-min bouts or three 10-min bouts. Single bouts increased maximal oxygen intake 13.9% and short bouts increased uptake by 7.6%. Similar improvements were seen in both groups for resting heart rate and decreased weight. Intermittent exercise could result in improvements in fitness- and health- related outcomes King et al. 76 2-year randomized clinical trial in 279 sedentary adults aged 50–65 years testing high- and low-intensity home-based exercise with high-intensity class-based exercise. Examined effects on adherence, fitness, and CVD risk factors. Both home-based exercise groups had significantly higher adherence than class-based at 1 year, but at 2 years high-intensity home-based exercise showed significantly less decrease than the other 2 groups. Fitness significantly increased and was maintained. Home-based showed significant improvements in HDL. First long-term randomized clinical trial demonstrating exercise does not have to take place in a fitness facility Jakicic et al. 36 20-week randomized controlled trial to test intermittent plus diet vs. continuous exercise plus diet effects on exercise adherence, weight loss, and fitness. Exercise performed in multiple 10-min bouts each day improved exercise adherence compared to continuous exercise (234 min/week vs. 188 min/week). Both interventions improved fitness. There was a trend for increased weight loss in the intermittent group. First study to show improved adherence with intermittent exercise Jakicic and Wing 37 24-week randomized controlled clinical trial in 48 overweight females. Compared intermittent plus diet with continuous plus diet exercise on adherence, fitness, and weight loss. This study replicates previous results over a longer period of time. Exercise adherence was greater in the intermittent group compared with the continuous group (388 min/week vs. 308 min/week). Fitness was improved in both groups and there was no difference between groups in weight loss. This substantiates previous findings over longer time periods. Intermittent exercise can improve exercise adherence. Snyder et al. 38 32-week randomized clinical trial to test whether accumulation of 30 min of moderate-intensity intermittent exercise will increase aerobic capacity, improve body composition, blood lipids, insulin, and glucose in 13 moderately obese females. Group data showed no change in aerobic capacity or CVD risk factors. 83% of exercise sessions were completed. 7 of 13 participants did improve aerobic capacity, lost fat and weight, and improved insulin. Adds further evicence for intermittent approaches Murphy and Hardman 39 10-week randomized trial to test training effects of short-bout, continous walking vs. controls on cardiorespiratory fitness, blood pressure, % body fat, body mass, and waist circumference in sedentary women. Both walking groups significantly increased VO 2 max and % body fat. The short-bout group significantly decreased BMI and waist circumference.

Lifestyle physical activity interventions selected for inclusion met the following criteria: (1) all papers and abstracts meeting our definition of Lifestyle Physical Activity that incorporated some or several measures of physical activity, cardiorespiratory fitness, or exercise adherence as an outcome measure; and (2) random assignment of participants to a lifestyle physical activity intervention, a standard exercise treatment, or a control group. Results Efficacy Most lifestyle physical activity interventions that have measured physical activity, cardiorespiratory or endurance fitness, or exercise adherence as primary outcomes have been conducted in the 1990s (see Table 2 However, during the 1980s, Epstein and colleagues 53 conducted one lifestyle study to examine maintenance of weight loss in children. In this study, all obese children received the same diet and eating behavior intervention but were randomized to aerobic exercise, lifestyle exercise, or calisthenics. While the primary outcome of this study was weight, fitness changes also were reported. The lifestyle group increased their predicted work capacity at 6 months, although notably it returned to baseline levels at the end of one year. The aerobic group increased their predicted work capacity at the end of one year. In all groups there were similar changes in eating behavior and weight loss at one year, but at the end of two years only the lifestyle group had maintained the weight loss. Assuming eating patterns remained constant, a logical conclusion is that children in the lifestyle exercise group continued to expend more energy in lifestyle activities. Unfortunately, this remains speculative because physical activity was not measured in this study. Table 2 .

A more recent study by Andersen et al. 47 compared a lifestyle physical activity intervention with a programmed STEP aerobics class in obese women. After 16 weeks, there were similar and significant improvements in physical activity in both groups. In a third study, Project Active , conducted in healthy but sedentary adults, Dunn et al. 50 report that 78% of participants assigned to a lifestyle physical activity intervention were meeting or exceeding the CDC/ACSM guidelines 3 at 6 months as measured by Stage of Motivational Readiness. 54 This percentage was similar to the 85% of the participants in the comparison group attending a state-of-the-art fitness center who were performing structured exercise. 50 However, different measures of the CDC/ACSM criterion yield disparate results in the same study. For example, when one examines whether participants in Project Active were meeting this criterion by using estimated energy expenditure measured by the 7-Day Physical Activity Recall (PAR) interview, 32% of Lifestyle and 27% of Structured participants were meeting or exceeding this goal. At 24 months, these different measures show a similar pattern of results. When using Stages of Change to assess meeting or exceeding the CDC/ACSM criterion, 61% of lifestyle and 50% of structured participants were meeting this criterion while the PAR estimated that 20% of both groups were meeting this goal. While Stages of Change and PAR estimates have been found to be significantly related, 55 better understanding of the sensitivity and specificity of each of these scales needs to be explored to help us more accurately describe the effects of all interventions. More recently Brawley and Rejeski 56 presented results of a 9-month intervention comparing traditional aerobic exercise (TAE) with group-motivated lifestyle behavior change (GMLC) in sedentary elderly adults aged 65 to 80 years. At 9 months, individuals randomly assigned to the GMLC were meeting public health guidelines for physical activity 5.8 times per week compared with TAE who were meeting these guidelines only 2.5 times per week. These studies indicate that lifestyle interventions are efficacious in helping individuals meet an established public health criterion for physical activity. 3 Further, there is some preliminary evidence that a large percentage of individuals are maintaining activity up to 2 years or longer. We were able to locate one 4-year intervention conducted by Elmer and colleagues that compared a lifestyle intervention plus one of four hypertensive medications to lifestyle alone. 57 Men and women increased their self-reported physical activity level by 57% and 36%, respectively, above baseline. Although this study utilized a self-report measure of physical activity, the finding that 59% of the participants were able to achieve blood pressure control without medication at the end of 4 years substantiates this result. Despite this, the results cannot be attributed to changes in physical activity alone since this lifestyle intervention did include dietary counseling as well as physical activity counseling. In addition to increasing overall levels of physical activity, these lifestyle studies show improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness. Results of published manuscripts and abstracts demonstrate that lifestyle activity that is either accumulated or done in continuous bouts can improve cardiorespiratory fitness. When lifestyle activity was compared to traditional exercise, the improvements in fitness have been similar. 36 , 37 , 47 , 58 , 59 For example, Project Active 24-month results show that both Lifestyle and Structured groups had significant and similar increases in cardiorespiratory fitness, and 25% of Lifestyle and 30% of Structured participants had maintained their increased fitness by 10% or more. 59 There is some preliminary evidence indicating that lifestyle physical activity interventions can be delivered through a variety of channels, although this evidence is ambiguous. For example, the interventions previously discussed have all been delivered in a group setting with face-to-face contact with a health educator, psychologist, or other supervisory staff. However, in studies conducted by Cardinal and Sachs, 60 , 61 written lifestyle, structured, or fitness feedback materials were delivered through the mail. This minimal contact resulted in significant increases in stage of motivational readiness in all groups with 10% of participants increasing their level of physical activity. Marcus and colleagues have similarly found mailed interventions to be effective in a 3-month worksite health promotion program. 62 They also have tested a computerized individualized tailored intervention with standard American Heart Association materials, both delivered by mail. 63 Both groups significantly improved their self-reported physical activity at 3 and 6 months, and the group receiving the individualized tailored materials increased their physical activity significantly more than the group that received the standard materials. Recently Chen and colleagues 64 compared an 8-week behavioral intervention delivered by telephone to promote walking with a nonbehavioral minimal intervention in 50 minority women. At all four follow-up assessments up to 30 months, both groups had significantly increased their self-reported walking by nearly 50%. In all of these minimal interventions, other measures of physical activity or fitness were not available; therefore, it is not clear if these interventions were truly effective, if the changes reflect secular trends, or if investigators were eliciting socially desired responses from participants. As stated earlier, lifestyle interventions also can be delivered by manipulating the environment to encourage the accumulation of moderate-intensity physical activity. In a study conducted in 1980, Brownell and colleagues found that stair use more than doubled in both obese and nonobese persons during a 2-week period when a colorful sign encouraging stair use was positioned at the stair/escalator choice point. 65 This approach also has been found to be successful in a worksite health promotion program. 66 More recently, Blamey and colleagues 67 replicated Brownell’s study results in Great Britain. This group of investigators is continuing their efforts to refine messages aimed at barriers of perceived effort and saving time, and Andersen et al. 68 also are examining stair climbing responses with signs aimed at promoting stair use for health versus weight control. Currently the data of Andersen and colleagues indicate that either sign promotes stair use equally well. In summary, lifestyle physical activity interventions have been shown to be efficacious in both children and adults. Most of these studies have been conducted over a relatively long period of time (e.g., 1 to 2 years) and show that participants are able to maintain the levels of physical activity and maintain improvements in fitness. In addition, lifestyle physical activity interventions show positive effects on cardiovascular disease risk factors such as reducing body fat and elevated blood pressure when compared to programmed exercise. 47 , 50 , 57 Generalizability Lifestyle interventions have been examined in a variety of populations. Epstein and colleagues 53 examined the effect of a lifestyle intervention with children. Dunn et al. 50 and Brawley and Rejeski 56 included both men and women, whereas Andersen and colleagues focused on overweight women. 47 A strength of these studies is that most included at least one fourth or more minority participants. To date, two studies have examined lifestyle physical activity interventions in elderly adults 46 , 56 (i.e., over the age of 65 years) with mixed results. The results of the study conducted by Brawley and Rejeski 56 were positive. Leaf and Reuben 46 randomly assigned 20 men and women, 65 years and older, into a lifestyle physical activity program for 16 weeks. Although energy expenditure did not increase significantly from baseline at the end of the 16 weeks, participants did significantly improve their ability to perform the sit-to-stand test, an indicator of overall level of functional ability. In general, the majority of these studies suggest that lifestyle physical activity interventions could be applicable to a wide variety of individuals. The evidence for the effectiveness of these interventions in elderly adults is not as convincing, although it is encouraging. Cost-effectiveness At present, little information exists on the cost-effectiveness of exercise interventions in general and lifestyle physical activity interventions in particular. 69 , 70 , 71 , 72 There is a need for cost-effectiveness analyses to determine what types of interventions might be feasible for public health applications. Dissemination These interventions have not been tested in any dissemination model to date; however, we believe this would be a worthwhile endeavor because of positive outcomes of efficacy studies. Conclusions Public health impact There are large numbers of adults in the United States and worldwide who do not engage in adequate amounts of physical activity. It is estimated that physical inactivity results in 200,000 excess deaths per year in the United States. 73 Therefore, strategies such as lifestyle physical activity could play a role in reducing inactivity in sedentary populations. The effect of any intervention can be measured in numbers of people who adopt a physically active way of life (short-term effect) or whether individuals maintain the change over time (long-term effect). Both approaches need to be addressed. At the present time, lifestyle interventions to increase physical activity do not appear to have had a significant public health effect largely because these interventions have been delivered to mostly small groups of individuals in clinical settings. 47 , 50 , 56 , 57 , 58 , 59 However, lifestyle interventions delivered by mail and telephone suggest that there may be opportunities to reach larger numbers of individuals to increase the adoption of physical activity. 60 , 61 , 62 , 63 , 64 Lifestyle interventions demonstrate long-term effects, both on increasing moderate-intensity physical activity and reducing sedentary activity. For example, targeted media campaigns aimed at increasing moderate-intensity activity have effectively increased these activity levels of a substantial percentage of individuals but the effects are short lived. 77 On the other hand, lifestyle activity interventions may have a more long-lasting effect on physical activity behavior. For example, at the end of 2 years in Project Active , over one fifth of individuals were meeting or exceeding public health recommendations for physical activity. For comparison, if we could get even one eighth of the 60% of Americans who are not sufficiently active to meet or exceed public health guidelines, we would be able to meet the activity goals established for Healthy People 2000. Efficacy and effect on subgroups Lifestyle interventions have been shown to be efficacious both over the short and long terms in selected sedentary populations, which have included substantial numbers of minority participants and a wide range of ages. Efficacious lifestyle interventions have been based on theories of behavior change and have included strong behavioral skill training. For example, Jakicic et al. and Jakicic and Wing 36 , 37 Andersen et al., 47 Dunn et al., 50 and Brawley and Rejeski 56 focused on promoting behavior change in weekly meetings. In addition, these interventions have focused for the most part on individual differences that allow important personal, social, and cultural factors to be taken into account. This flexibility may help individuals understand that there are a multitude of ways to integrate moderate intensity physical activity into their lives and may enable lifestyle interventions to be applied to subgroups such as the elderly, disabled, and other underserved populations. Lifestyle approaches may be appealing to older adults and those with concurrent disease, but such data are not available and remain to be tested. Further, studies of environmental manipulations also hold promise in helping individuals perceive choices in their environments and have been shown to be efficacious over the short term. Needed are long-term studies of environmental interventions related to making lifestyle choices to be active. Maintenance Although there are relatively few lifestyle physical activity studies, most are long-term studies with follow-up ranging from 9 months to 4 years. After 4 years, Elmer and colleagues 57 found that on average, participants increased energy expenditure by approximately 800 kcal per week, only 200 kcal short of the goal established by the Surgeon General’s Report. 5 These results give reason to be optimistic that long-term changes are potentially achievable through lifestyle physical activity interventions. Cost-effectiveness and implementation Cost-effectiveness of lifestyle physical activity interventions is an unanswered question. The cost-effectiveness of environmental manipulations such as sign use are likely to be one of the most cost-effective interventions that public health agencies could deliver because of the relative low cost of signs and their ability to reach large numbers of individuals. In terms of implementation, these approaches are relatively new and are not being widely disseminated. However, we believe that lifestyle approaches are ready to be implemented on a limited wider scale by public health practitioners because of the efficacy of current studies. Recommendations for research and practice Lifestyle physical activity interventions are a relatively new type of physical activity intervention. Despite the fact that few lifestyle physical activity interventions have been conducted, there is strong evidence that they are efficacious interventions for sedentary and unfit adults and children. There are a number of recommendations that were developed from working groups at the Physical Activity Interventions Conference for both researchers and practitioners. Recommendations for research are as follows. 1. It is important to test dissemination models to determine if these interventions can be effectively delivered on a large scale. This could include delivering interventions by mail and telephone, and also through new technologies such as the Internet. 2. We need population surveys to assess understanding of public health messages. For example, do individuals understand and actually perform moderate amounts and intensities of physical activity? 3. Basic dose-response research is needed to develop a better understanding of the effects of accumulating physical activity at various intensities of activity, particularly as related to groups of different ages, ethnicity, and health status. For example, elderly individuals may be able to maintain function by accumulating short bouts of light activities, while obese men and women may need to accumulate 60 min or more of moderate-intensity physical activity. 4. Longitudinal studies of 5 or more years in duration are needed to examine issues related to how well individuals are able to maintain activity and the health effects of maintaining physical activity over a lifetime. 5. Lifestyle approaches need to be tested in special populations such as the underserved, chronically ill, and disabled individuals. 6. A wider variety of environmental manipulations need to be tested for their efficacy. Further study also is needed on the effects of targeted messages on those who are least active. 7. Cost-effectiveness analyses need to be performed both on behavioral lifestyle physical activity interventions and on environmental manipulations. Practitioners also can do a great deal to disseminate these interventions and to further our understanding of their effects. Recommendations for practitioners are as follows. 1. Media campaigns are needed to inform the public of lifestyle physical activity and, in particular, to explain moderate amounts and intensities of activity. 2. Practitioners need to learn how to implement behavioral skills training and utilize these techniques in their programs that are now being taught in public health departments, health clubs, and recreation departments in order to more widely disseminate lifestyle physical activity interventions. 3. Effectiveness of lifestyle physical activity interventions needs to be assessed by use of simple inexpensive measures such as step counters and activity logs. 4. Cost-effectiveness analyses of environmental manipulations need to be performed. 74 , 75 Acknowledgements This review was funded in part by the National Institutes of Health grants HL48597, HL58608, HL561227, and DK46204, and American Heart Association (Maryland Chapter) MDBG796.

Without intervention, the number of global deaths is projected to rise to 6·5 million in 2015 and to 7·8 million in 2030. The rising burden of stroke, especially in low-income and middle-income countries, leads us to propose a worldwide goal for stroke: a 2% reduction each year over and above that which may happen as a result of better case management and treatment. The experience of high-income countries indicates that sustained interventions can achieve at least the required 4% annual average decline in stroke mortality for people age 60–69 years. Achieving this goal for stroke would result in 6·4 million fewer deaths from stroke from 2005 to 2015. More of these deaths will be averted in low-income and middle-income countries than in high-income countries. Physical activity participation among persons with disabilities: Barriers and facilitators 2004, American Journal of Preventive Medicine Show abstract The purpose of this study was to identify various barriers and facilitators associated with participation in fitness and recreation programs/facilities among persons with disabilities. Focus groups were conducted in ten regions across the United States in 2001 to 2002 with four types of participants: (1) consumers with disabilities, (2) architects, (3) fitness and recreation professionals, and (4) city planners and park district managers. Sessions were tape-recorded and content analyzed; focus group facilitators took notes of identified barriers and facilitators to access. Content analysis of tape recordings revealed 178 barriers and 130 facilitators. The following themes were identified: (1) barriers and facilitators related to the built and natural environment; (2) economic issues; (3) emotional and psychological barriers; (4) equipment barriers; (5) barriers related to the use and interpretation of guidelines, codes, regulations, and laws; (6) information-related barriers; (7) professional knowledge, education, and training issues; (8) perceptions and attitudes of persons who are not disabled, including professionals; (9) policies and procedures both at the facility and community level; and (10) availability of resources. The degree of participation in physical activity among people with disabilities is affected by a multifactorial set of barriers and facilitators that are unique to this population. Future research should utilize this information to develop intervention strategies that have a greater likelihood of success.

Copy URL Share a link Share on Email Facebook x LinkedIn Reddit Wechat Abstract A brief intervention using Zero-time Exercise (ZTEx), a foot-in-the-door approach, was developed to reduce sedentary behaviour and increase physical activity. ZTEx refers to the integration of simple strength- and stamina-enhancing physical activity into daily life, which can be done anytime, anywhere and by anyone. This paper presents the development, feasibility, and preliminary evidence for the effectiveness of this intervention under the Hong Kong Jockey Club FAMILY Project. Needs assessments were conducted with social workers from the\xa0Christian Family Services Center(CFSC) and the Social Welfare Department (SWD). This single group prospective ZTEx intervention trial, guided by the Health Action Process Approach, included a 3-hr core session at baseline and a 1-hr booster session at 1-month follow-up. Fifty-six participants\xa0(social and service-related workers) from CFSC ( n =\xa028) and SWD ( n =\xa028) received the intervention and completed the self-administered questionnaires at baseline. Forty-nine and 43 participants completed the 1-month and 3-month self-administered questionnaires, respectively. Fifteen participants attended the focus group interviews to share their feedback on ZTEx intervention after implementing their community-based ZTEx activities. Intention-to-treat analysis was conducted with missing data replaced by baseline values. Participants reported significant decreases in sitting time by 27 (2, 52) minutes (mean [95% confidence interval]) and 36 (0.2, 71) minutes on a weekday, increases in physical activity while seated by 0.7 (0.2, 1.4) days and 1.1 (0.6, 1.7) days in a week, and improvements in perceived knowledge, outcome expectancies and plan on doing ZTEx at the 1-month and 3-month follow-up, respectively. Balance and muscle strength significantly improved at the 1-month follow-up. The effect ranged from small to large\xa0(Cohen\'s d : 0.27–1.05, all p <\xa00.05). The qualitative feedbacks support the quantitative findings. Our findings show early evidence that ZTEx effectively reduced sedentary behaviour and enhanced physical activity and fitness. Further trials on this simple and low-cost intervention as the first step to promote higher intensity exercise are warranted.

Epidemiology Approximately 31% of the global population aged ≥15 years engages in insufficient physical activity, and it is known to contribute to the death of approximately 3.2 million people every year [ 1 ]. In South Korea, the physical activity rate is on the decline among adults aged ≥19 years, irrespective of the type of activity, including aerobic exercise, walking, and muscle training. Therefore, in 2017, the rates of aerobic exercise, walking, and muscle training in the Korean adult population were 48.5%, 39.0%, and 21.6%, respectively, with the majority of the Korean population engaging in physical inactivity [ 2 ]. In addition to physical inactivity, sedentary behavior is also a serious problem, and a substantial number of people engage in it for prolonged periods. For instance, Americans spend 55% of their waking time (7.7 hours a day) engaged in sedentary behaviors whereas Europeans spend 40% of their leisure time (2.7 hours a day) watching television [ 3 ]. Similar patterns have been observed in Koreans, who have been reported to demonstrate long sedentary times. According to Korea Health Statistics of 2018, adults in Korea aged ≥19 years engage in 8.3 hours of sedentary time. Only 8.9% of the adult population engaged in <4 hours of sedentary time whereas 20.6% of the adults were involved in >12 hours of sedentary time [ 4 ]. 2. Causes of Physical Inactivity and Sedentary Lifestyles A poor participation in physical activity is speculated to be influenced by multiple factors. Some environmental factors include traffic congestion, air pollution, shortage of parks or pedestrian walkways, and a lack of sports or leisure facilities [ 1 ]. Television viewing, video viewing, and cell phone usage are positively correlated with an increasingly sedentary lifestyle [ 5 ]. Sedentary behaviors are projected to continue to rise on the basis of this socio-cultural background. Sedentary lifestyles have a major impact on the overall health of the global population. Many people worldwide engage in sedentary lifestyles, and the prevalence of relevant non-communicable diseases is on the rise. It is well known that insufficient physical activity, that is, physical inactivity, has a detrimental effect on health. Physical inactivity is the fourth leading risk factor for global mortality, accounting for 6% of global mortality [ 6 ]. Despite the fact that sedentary behavior poses a comparable risk to health and contributes to the prevalence of various diseases, most physical activity-related education in clinical practice is focused on improving the physical activity levels, with less emphasis on lowering the sedentary behavior. In addition to understanding and informing patients about the health impact of a sedentary lifestyle, healthcare providers of various fields, including clinicians, should reflect upon its significance in policies. This study examined the effects of a sedentary lifestyle on health and the lifestyle-related improvements to be made to promote healthy living. OVERVIEW OF SEDENTARY LIFESTYLE 1. The Concept of a Sedentary Lifestyle Sedentary behavior is defined as any waking behavior such as sitting or leaning with an energy expenditure of 1.5 metabolic equivalent task (MET) or less [ 7 ]. This definition, proposed by the Sedentary Behavior Research Network in 2012, is currently the most widely used definition of sedentary behavior. Some examples of sedentary behavior include television viewing, playing video games, using a computer, sitting at school or work, and sitting while commuting ( Figure 1 ) [ 8 ]. According to the 2011 Compendium of Physical Activities, MET is defined as the ratio of work metabolic rate to the standard resting metabolic rate (RMR) of 1 kcal/(kg/h). One MET is the RMR or energy cost for a person at rest. When classified quantitatively based on their intensities, physical activities can be classified into 1.0–1.5 METs (sedentary behavior), 1.6–2.9 METs (light intensity), 3–5.9 (moderate intensity), and ≥6 METs (vigorous intensity) ( Figure 2 ) [ 9 ]. Figure. 1. Open in a new tab Examples of sedentary behavior. (A) Playing a video game. (B) Watching television. (C) Using a computer. (D) Reading a book. Figure. 2. Open in a new tab Examples of moderate to vigorous physical activity. (A) Riding a bicycle. (B) Running. A sedentary lifestyle increases all-cause mortality and the risks for cardiovascular diseases (CVD), diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), and cancers (breast, colon, colorectal, endometrial, and epithelial ovarian cancer). This has been consistently documented in the literature [ 3 , 10 , 11 ]. There is no disagreement on the fact that prolonged total sedentary behavior times are associated with poor disease outcomes. However, the patterns of sedentary time may differ even within the same total amount of time, and not much is known about the particular patterns of prolonged sedentary time that pose more significant health hazards (for example, continuous sedentary behavior without a break or intermittent sedentary behavior) [ 12 ]. One study reported that even if the total sedentary time was equal, having short sedentary bouts and engaging in physical activities intermittently can have relative health benefits. The total sedentary time and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) have been reported to be negatively correlated, where the waist circumference (standardized β, -0.16; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.31 to -0.02; P=0.026), body mass index (β, -0.19; 95% CI, -0.35 to -0.02; P=0.026), triglyceride level (β, -0.18; 95% CI, -0.34 to -0.02; P=0.029), and 2-hour postprandial plasma glucose level (β, -0.18; 95% CI, -0.34 to -0.02; P=0.025) decreased with increasing the number of breaks in the sedentary time [ 13 ]. Furthermore, when the sedentary time was interrupted with light- or moderate-intensity physical activity, the systolic and diastolic blood pressures dropped by 2–3 mm Hg whereas interrupting the sedentary time with light-intensity physical activity (LIPA) or simple muscle training in patients with diabetes (88% of the population had HTN) decreased the systolic pressure by 14–16 mm Hg and the diastolic pressure by 8–10 mm Hg [ 14 ]. 2. Physiological Features The exact mechanisms of the various adverse effects of sedentary behavior on the human body are currently unknown. However, several hypotheses have been proposed for the overall understanding of the impact of sedentary behavior on the human body, which are described below. Sedentary lifestyles are associated with metabolic dysfunctions, such as elevated plasma triglycerides and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and reduced insulin sensitivity [ 15 , 16 ]. Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) is a protein that interacts at the cellular level, and a low LPL concentration is known to decrease the plasma HDL cholesterol level, while affecting the prevalence of severe HTN, diabetes-induced dyslipidemia, metabolic disorders caused by aging, metabolic syndrome, and coronary artery diseases. Moreover, LPL activity is diminished by physical inactivity. Additionally, physical inactivity inhibits LPL activity in skeletal muscles and rapidly signals for impaired lipid metabolism. In an experiment based on a rat model, the reduction of LPL activity in rats that engaged in light walking was only about 10% of the LPL activity in rats that were only placed in their cages [ 17 ]. The fact that muscle LPL activity is highly sensitive to physical inactivity and low-intensity muscular contractile activity can serve as evidence supporting the theory that sedentary behavior is a risk factor for various metabolic disorders [ 18 ]. Physical inactivity reduces bone mineral density [ 19 ]. In a study on healthy adult men and women, 12 weeks of bed rest decreased the mineral density of the lumbar spine, femoral neck, and greater trochanter by 1%–4% [ 19 ]. The balance between bone resorption and bone deposition mediates the relationship between sedentary behavior and the reduction of bone mineral density. According to some studies, bed rest elevates bone resorption markers and does not influence bone formation markers [ 20 - 22 ]. Some studies have provided limited evidence that sedentary behavior has a negative impact on vascular health. A study on healthy women reported that 56 days of head-down bed rest decreased the endothelium-dependent vasodilation while increasing the endothelial cell damage. Such alterations in vascular function were prevented through aerobic exercise and muscle training [ 23 ]. SEDENTARY LIFESTYLES AND HEALTH RISKS 1. Sedentary Lifestyles, Mortality, and Morbidity (Cardiovascular Diseases and Other Causes) A sedentary lifestyle is strongly associated with CVD, DM, cancer, and premature mortality. The total daily sedentary time and television viewing time were correlated with an increased all-cause mortality risk [ 24 ]. In a study analyzing the mortality rates of people with >10 hours and <5 hours of sitting times a day, the sitting time was significantly correlated with all-cause mortality (odds ratio [OR], 1.16; 95% CI, 1.04– 1.29; P<0.05) [ 25 ]. In a study that examined the correlation between the television viewing time and all-cause mortality, the people who watched television for ≥6 hours a day had a two-fold higher all-cause mortality risk compared to the people who watched television for <2 hours a day (hazard ratio [HR], 1.98; 95% CI, 1.25–3.15) [ 26 ] whereas the people who watched television for ≥4 hours a day had a 1.5 times higher all-cause mortality risk compared to the people who watched TV for <2 hours a day (HR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.19–1.83) [ 27 ]. Sedentary time (sitting time, television or screen viewing time, leisure time while sitting in a day) is independently associated with allcause mortality, CVD incidence or mortality, incidence or mortality of certain cancers (breast, colon, colorectal, endometrial, and epithelial ovarian cancer), and type 2 DM. In particular, the adverse effect of sedentary time was more evident among people who engaged in little physical activity compared to those who engaged in frequent physical activity. The relative risk (RR) for all-cause mortality was 30% higher with high physical activity (HR, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.84–1.59) compared to that with low physical activity (HR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.22–1.75) [ 28 ]. 2. Sedentary Lifestyles and Metabolic Diseases 1) Diabetes mellitus The fact that the prevalence of type 2 DM increases with increasing sedentary time has been consistently documented in various studies (HR, 1.91; 95% CI, 1.64–2.22) [ 28 ]. In an assessment of DM risk considering both sedentary time and physical activity, the DM risk increased with the increasing daily sedentary time (HR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.04–1.22; P<0.001), and the effect was not offset by the level of physical activity (HR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.01–1.19; P<0.001). The risk for CVD also increased with the increasing daily sedentary time (HR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.27–1.30; P<0.001), and although the physical activity level slightly offset this effect, sedentary time still significantly increased the risk (HR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.01–1.19; P<0.001). This shows that the level of physical activity does not influence the impact of prolonged sedentary time on the risk for CVD and DM. A few biological mechanisms can explain the impact of the total daily sedentary time on CVD and DM risk. Prolonged sitting is known to affect the content and activity of muscle glucose transporter proteins. An animal study observed that prolonged muscle inactivity reduces the LPL activity, which regulates blood lipid concentration and carbohydrate metabolism through cellular pathways that differ from the normal motor response; however, additional verification is required by human studies [ 29 ]. 2) Hypertension A sedentary lifestyle affects blood pressure through various mechanisms, and subsequently changes the blood pressure by altering the cardiac output and total peripheral vascular resistance. A prolonged sedentary time reduces the metabolic demands and systemic blood flow, and by stimulating the sympathetic nervous system, it decreases insulin sensitivity and vascular function while increasing the oxidative stress and promoting the low-grade inflammatory cascade [ 14 ]. A study reported a direct association between sedentary behavior and a high risk of HTN (HR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.01–2.18; P for trend=0.03). Among sedentary behaviors, non-interactive sedentary behaviors (watching television, sleeping) have been reported to further escalate the risk for HTN compared to interactive sedentary behaviors (driving, using a computer) [ 30 ]. 3) Dyslipidemia Sedentary behaviors induce metabolic dysfunction characterized by elevated blood triglyceride levels, reduced HDL-cholesterol levels, and diminished insulin sensitivity [ 17 ]. A study reported that sedentary behaviors increased the rate of newly diagnosed dyslipidemias in women (OR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.00–1.36) and increased the risk for dyslipidemia in both men and women (men: OR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.02–1.44) (women: OR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.04–1.48) [ 31 ]. In contrast, MVPA was negatively associated with blood triglyceride levels (β, -0.18; 95% CI, -0.36 to -0.01; P=0.038) [ 32 ]. 4) Obesity Sedentary time is known to have significant correlations with waist circumference and clustered metabolic risk scores independent of MVPA. The waist circumference increased by 3.1 cm with a 10% increase in the sedentary time [ 32 ]. Obese patients tend to move less; therefore, increasing the activity levels can be utilized as a strategy in obesity treatment [ 33 ]. While this is a widely known fact, the underlying mechanism remains unknown. A study in 2020 reported that the reason for weight gain is a prolonged sedentary time [ 34 ]. According to a Swedish study that compared an experimental group which wore a heavy 11-kg vest for 8 hours a day and the control group which wore a light 1-kg vest for 8 hours a day, the experimental group had a weight loss of 1.6 kg whereas the control group lost 0.3 kg three weeks later. An animal study shed light on an energy balance system known as the “gravitostat” that maintains a consistent body weight [ 35 ]. This regulation occurs partially due to an influence on appetite where the system requires a personal weighing machine for the proper functioning of this regulation. This Swedish study found that humans also feature a similar built-in scale. An individual’s scale measures lower values with prolonged sitting, which explains why sitting is associated with obesity and poor health. A heavy vest can increase the score on this, thereby inducing weight loss [ 34 ]. 3. Sedentary Lifestyles and Cancer Risk Sedentary behavior is also closely related to the prevalence of cancer. According to a study that investigated the correlation between sedentary behavior and cancer prevalence, the cancer risk was 13% higher in the group with the longest sedentary time compared to that with the shortest sedentary time [ 28 ], and another study reported that sedentary time increased the overall cancer risk by 20% [ 36 ]. Prolonged sitting increases colorectal, endometrial, ovarian, and prostate cancer risks, and it has been reported to increase cancer mortality particularly in women [ 37 ]. There was a significant correlation between cancer mortality and the incidences of breast, colorectal, endometrial, and epithelial ovarian cancers [ 28 ]. An increased total sitting time was positively correlated with colon cancer (RR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.03–1.50) and endometrial cancer (RR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.08–1.61) [ 36 ]. Additionally, television viewing time was also positively correlated with colon cancer (RR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.19–1.98) and endometrial cancer (RR, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.21–2.28) [ 36 ]. Occupational sitting time was positively correlated with only colon cancer (RR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.09–1.41) [ 36 ]. Sedentary behavior leads to metabolic dysfunctions such as hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, perturbation of insulin-like growth factor axis, and changes in the circulation levels of sex hormones. Altered circulation levels of sex hormones can be linked to hormone-related cancers such as breast and endometrial cancers [ 38 ]. Additionally, sedentary behavior induces low-grade chronic systemic inflammation, and sedentary time is associated with inflammation-related markers such as C-reactive protein (β, 0.18±0.06; P=0.002), interleukin 6 (β, 0.24±0.06; P<0.001), leptin (β, 0.15±0.04; P<0.001), and the leptin: adiponectin ratio (β, 0.21±0.05; P<0.001) [ 39 ]. Chronic inflammation can trigger cancer growth [ 40 ]. Adiposity can also mediate the relationship between sedentary behavior and cancer, and obesity is a risk factor for several cancers [ 8 ]. 4. Sedentary Lifestyles and Osteoporosis Sedentary behavior is known to show a negative association with the bone mineral density of the total femur and all hip sub-regions irrespective of MVPA, and the bone mineral density (g/cm2) of the total femur had a marked negative correlation with the sedentary time (β, -0.16; 95% CI, -0.24 to -0.08) in adult women [ 41 ]. Bone mineral density was correlated with the duration and not the frequency of sedentary behavior. In men, sedentary behavior was not markedly correlated with the bone mineral density of the hip and spine [ 41 ]. 5. Sedentary Lifestyles and Musculoskeletal Diseases A prolonged sedentary time was correlated with chronic knee pain. In an analysis of the correlation between chronic knee pain and the total daily sedentary time (<5, 5–7, 8–10, >10 hours), the results claimed that the incidence of chronic knee pain was higher in individuals with longer sedentary times (P for trend=0.02) [ 42 ]. In particular, a sedentary time >10 hours a day was markedly correlated with chronic knee pain (adjusted OR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.02–1.61; P=0.03) [ 42 ]. People who engaged in greater physical activity had less chronic knee pain (adjusted OR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.67–0.91; P=0.00), but women with >10 hours of sedentary time while engaging in greater physical activity were highly likely to experience chronic knee pain (adjusted OR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.02–1.39; P=0.03). The study recommends individuals to shorten their sedentary times to <10 hours a day [ 42 ]. 6. Sedentary Lifestyles and Other Diseases 1) Depression Mentally passive sedentary behaviors such as television viewing (RR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.07–1.30), sitting, listening to music, and talking while sitting were positively correlated with depression risks (RR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.08–1.27). In contrast, mentally active sedentary behaviors such as reading books or newspapers, driving, attending a meeting, or knitting or sewing were not markedly correlated with depression risk (RR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.83–1.15) [ 43 ]. Using a computer, which is a mentally active sedentary behavior, was not correlated with depression risk in one study (RR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.79–1.23) [ 43 ] but was positively correlated with depression risk in another study (RR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.10–1.34) [ 44 ], and thus its correlation with depression remains controversial. The mechanism underlying the correlation between sedentary behavior and depression may involve the following: sedentary behaviors may increase the risk for depression by blocking direct communication and lowering social interactions, or by reducing the available time to engage in physical activities that help to prevent and treat depression [ 43 ]. 2) Cognitive function The relationship between sedentary behavior and cognitive function is uncertain. A systematic review found marked alterations of cognition (improved in two studies45,46) and impaired in two studies47,48)) in some studies but no changes in cognitive function in some studies.49) However, the only long-term study included in that systematic review suggested that a less-sedentary lifestyle and less sedentary work have benefits related to cognitive function.46) It is believed that replacing the sedentary time with physical activity can help improve the cognitive function. In a randomized clinical trial that analyzed the cognitive changes after 30 minutes of sedentary behavior with other activities for 6 months in older adults with little physical activity, replacing the sedentary time with MVPA and sleep significantly improved cognitive functions, and replacing it with LIPA did not lead to statistically significant changes [ 46 ]. SEDENTARY LIFESTYLES AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY 1. Discrepant Health Effects of Sedentary Lifestyle and Physical Activity Past studies have observed that a prolonged sedentary lifestyle leads to poor health outcomes irrespective of physical activity. A sedentary lifestyle was independently correlated with mortality and was not compensated for by physical activity [ 10 ]. The time spent in front of a screen was positively correlated with the presence of metabolic syndrome, independent of the level of physical activity (OR, 3.30; 95% CI, 2.04–5.34) [ 50 ]. 2. The Attenuative Effect of Physical Activity on Sedentary Lifestyles A few recent studies have reported that increasing physical activity can offset the adverse impacts of sedentary behavior. In particular, the offset effect was more evident in people with little physical activity. A meta-analysis reported that mortality was not elevated in the people engaging in high levels of moderate-intensity physical activity (60– 75 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity a day) even when they had >8 hours of sedentary time a day. There was no difference in mortality between the most active people (>35.5 MET-h/wk) with <4 hours of sedentary time a day and equally active people (>35.5 MET-h/wk) with >8 hours of sedentary time a day (HR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.99–1.10). However, television viewing for >3 hours a day increased the mortality regardless of physical activity, and the people who watched television for ≥5 hours a day showed markedly high mortalities (HR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.05–1.28) [ 51 ]. In one study, sitting time showed a dose-response with all-cause mortality and CVD mortality risk in the least active group (<150 MVPA min/wk) [ 51 ]. In contrast, the group with at least 8 hours of sedentary time a day showed a higher mortality than the group with less than 4 hours of sedentary time a day (HR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.13–2.03). However, the group who met the essential MVPA criterion (150–299 MVPA min/ wk) or engaged in more physical activity did not show a consistent trend in the relationship between increased sitting time and CVD and all-cause mortalities. Similarly, a study showed that a sedentary time of over 9 hours per day in the low physical activity group (<600 METs-min/wk) had a significant association with an increased CVD risk (OR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.04–1.62). In the group with more physical activity, sedentary time was not significantly associated with CVD risk [ 52 ]. In other words, while increased sedentary time increases the mortality among people who engage in little physical activity, adequate physical activity seems to offset the impact of increased sedentary time on mortality [ 53 ]. A study analyzed the correlation between all-cause mortality and net uncompensated sedentary behavior metabolic equivalent hours (USMh=MET/h [sedentary time]–MET/h [MVPA time]), which was computed by subtracting METs for MVPA from METs for sedentary behavior throughout a day. USMh was independently associated with all-cause mortality when it was greater than 7 MET/h, and for television viewing, when it was greater than 3 MET/h. The mean increase in mortality per USMh was 1% (RR, 1.01; 95% CI, 1.00–1.02; P=0.01), and the mean increase in mortality per USMh for TV watching was 7% (RR, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.04–1.10; P<0.001). In other words, physical activity as well as sedentary time should be assessed, and therefore, USMh was revealed to be a more practical index for assessing sedentary behavior [ 54 ]. In the people with the least daily activity (≤17 min/d MVPA), replacing 30 minutes of the sitting time each day with light physical activity reduced the mortality risk by 14% (HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.81–0.89), and replacing it with MVPA reduced the mortality risk by 45% (HR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.47–0.62). However, in the people with the highest daily activity (MVPA >38 min/d), replacing the sitting time with LIPA or MVPA was not linked with a reduced mortality risk [ 55 ]. Replacing the sedentary behavior with physical activity also has an impact on cancer-related mortality. A recently published study showed that sedentary behavior was independently associated with cancer mortality risk, where a higher sedentary time led to a greater cancer mortality risk. In this study, the individuals in the top 1/3 of the sedentary group showed a substantially higher cancer mortality risk than those in the bottom 1/3 (adjusted HR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.01–2.27) [ 56 ]. However, replacing 30 minutes of sedentary time with LIPA reduced the cancer mortality by 8% (HR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.86–0.97) and replacing it with MVPA reduced it by 31% (HR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.48–0.97) [ 56 ]. CLINICAL PEARLS FOR SEDENTARY INDIVIDUALS While the various countries have their own guidelines for physical activity and sedentary behavior, overall, the recommendations are similar. 1. Recommendations in the United States Although the 2018 Advisory Committee revealed that sedentary behavior is strongly correlated with all-cause and CVD mortalities in adults, the evidence was insufficient to offer advice on the recommended daily sedentary time and duration of physical activity. It could not determine the recommended daily sedentary time and frequency of physical activity for adults or adolescents because the risks associated with sedentary behavior are related to the amount of MVPA. It is advisable for inactive people not engaging in moderate physical activity (MPA) to lower their sedentary behavior and replace their sedentary behavior with LIPA. However, LIPA alone is insufficient to obtain health benefits; they will be able to reduce their health risk by gradually increasing their physical activities to MPA or beyond. Inactive people who engage in insufficient physical activity that does not meet the criterion of 150–300 minutes of MPA per week would be able to obtain health benefits by increasing their MPA slightly and reap even greater health benefits by reducing their sedentary behaviors. Active people who engage in sufficient physical activity (150–300 minutes of MPA per week) would gain more benefits by lowering their sedentary behaviors. Highly active people who engage in more than 300 minutes of MPA per week are recommended to maintain or improve their levels of physical activity by participating in a variety of activities [ 57 ]. 2. Recommendations in Australia The Australian Government Department of Health presented age-specific recommendations for physical activity and sedentary behavior. According to the Australian physical activity-sedentary behavior guidelines, individuals are recommended to minimize their sitting times, including sitting during work, commuting, and breaks, and to avoid sitting for prolonged periods as much as possible [ 58 ]. Infants and children aged less than 5 years are advised to not be bound in a stroller, car seat, or high chair for more than 1 hour at a time. While they engage in sedentary behaviors, they are recommended to spend time reading books, singing, solving puzzles, and talking with their caregivers as compared to watching television or a DVD (digital video disc), playing on the computer, or playing other video games [ 59 ]. For children between the ages of 5 and 17, the sedentary recreational screen time should be limited to 2 hours a day, and they are advised to engage in positive social interactions and experiences. Older adults aged 65 years and more are advised to remain active as much as possible every day [ 60 ]. The recommended amount of physical activity for adults is 150–300 minutes of MPA or 75–150 minutes of vigorous physical activity or an equivalent MVPA per week. 3. Recommendations in Korea The guidelines for physical activity for the Korean population published by the Department of Health Promotion at the Ministry of Health and Welfare in October 2013 recommend that people limit their sedentary leisure time (e.g., computer, smartphone, and television) to 2 hours a day and engage in a low level of physical activity. Children and adolescents are recommended to develop an active lifestyle overall, including sports, physical education, walking, and cycling at home and school. If older adults and people with chronic diseases are unable to engage in the recommended physical activities, these groups of people are advised to engage in physical activities to the extents permitted by their situations [ 61 ]. CONCLUSION Since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, social distancing has become important, and engaging in physical activity in the postcorona era is difficult. Therefore, a study of the problems of sedentary lifestyle is considered more valuable at this point. A sedentary lifestyle has an array of adverse health effects, including elevated all-cause mortality, CVD mortality, cancer risk, risks for metabolic diseases such as DM, HTN, dyslipidemia, and musculoskeletal diseases such as knee pain and osteoporosis. It is indisputable that the negative health impacts intensify with increases in the total daily sedentary times. For this reason, it is important to reduce the sedentary time as much as possible. The findings of studies determining the worst type of sedentary behavior varied across studies. Studies observed better health outcomes with a short sedentary bout with intermittent physical activity, with light physical activity or simple muscle training, intermittent interruptions of sedentary behavior during work, and rest with physical activity. Health outcomes also vary depending on the type of sedentary behavior and watching television led to the worst outcomes. This may be attributable to the fact that television watching is a passive sedentary behavior and that people often consume snacks while watching television. Therefore, among the various types of sedentary behaviors, individuals should refrain from watching television as much as possible, and snacking should be minimized while watching television. Even if the total daily sedentary time cannot be reduced for unavoidable reasons, it is advisable to engage in sufficient exercise equivalent to or more than 150–300 minutes of MPA per week, as studies found that physical activity could offset the adverse effects of sedentary behavior. If sufficient exercise cannot be performed, individuals should at least perform light physical activity, as opposed to not engaging in physical activity at all as health benefits can be obtained even with light physical activity, albeit insufficient; they should further try to increase their physical activity levels as their situations permit.

To investigate whether changes in physical activity (PA) have an impact on sedentary behavior (SB) during a lifestyle intervention. Design. Study design was a randomized trial. Setting/Subjects. Participants (n = 204) were individuals with low PA and high sedentary leisure screen time from the Chicago area. Intervention. Participants were randomized to either increase PA (iPA) or decrease sedentary leisure (dSED). The intervention consisted of decision support, coaching, and financial incentives. For iPA participants, the goal was at least 60 min/d of self-reported moderate-tovigorous-intensity PA (MVPA). For dSED participants the goal was less than 90 min/d of sedentary leisure screen time. Measures. Daily accelerometer-based measures of SB and bout-corrected MVPA were obtained. Analysis. Linear mixed-effects models were fit to estimate the effect of the intervention on MVPA and total SB and to estimate the effect of daily changes in MVPA on daily SB. Results. The iPA participants increased their bout-corrected MVPA by 14 min/d (p < .001) and decreased their total SB by 18 min/d (p < .001). The dSED participants did not significantly change their PA or their total SB. On days when participants exercised, each 10-minute bout of MVPA was associated with a 6-minute decrease in SB on the same day (p < .001). Conclusion. In an intervention study designed to increase MVPA, participants who increase their time spent exercising will obtain much of this time by reducing their SB.

Aim The aim of this study was to evaluate the enablers and barriers for older adults associated with participation in a home-based exercise snacking program delivered and monitored using an Amazon Echo Show 5 device (Alexa). Methods This study used an interpretive description qualitative design to conduct semi-structured interviews following a 12-week pilot study in 15 adults aged 60–89\xa0years with at least one chronic condition. All participants were prescribed a home based, individualised, lower limb focussed ‘exercise snacking’ program (involving\u2009≤\u200910\xa0min of bodyweight exercises 2–4 times per day) delivered and monitored by an Alexa. Qualitative interview data were analysed using thematic analysis. Results All 15 participants (mean age 70.3\xa0years) attended the semi-structured interview. Themes including time efficiency, flexibility, perceived health benefits, and motivation were enablers for participation in the ‘exercise snacking’ program. A lack of upper body exercises and omission of exercise equipment in the program, as well as a lack of time and motivation for performing exercise snacks three or more times per day, were barriers to participation. Conclusion While ‘exercise snacking’ is acceptable for older adults, future trials should provide equipment (e.g. adjustable dumbbells, exercise bands), prescribe whole-body exercise programs, and establish strategies to support participation in more than three exercise snacks per day.

Introduction One-third of the Australian population have at least one chronic health condition, with the prevalence increasing to approximately 50% for those aged over 50\xa0years [ 1 ]. Many older adults with chronic conditions report engaging in less than 30\xa0min of physical activity per week, which has been associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality over the subsequent three years [ 2 ]. To mitigate the burden of chronic health conditions, current best-practice guidelines recommend older adults undertake an individualised exercise program prescribed by a health professional [ 3 ]. However, adherence to a supervised exercise program delivered by a health professional has been reported to be less than 35% in community-dwelling older adults [ 4 ]. Key barriers to exercise participation in older adults include limited access to facilities and equipment, cost, a high perceived difficulty, and family and work responsibilities [ 5 , 6 , 7 ]. These factors highlight the need to identify more feasible strategies that limit barriers to exercise participation in older adults. Emerging evidence suggests a home-based, brief (≤\u200910\xa0min) but frequent (e.g. 2–4 times per day) ‘exercise snacking’ program involving minimal-to-no equipment may be a feasible, safe and effective strategy for engaging older adults to participate in home-based exercise programs [ 8 , 9 , 10 ]. Exercise snacking trials have reported improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness [ 10 ] and/or markers of metabolic health [ 9 ]. There is also emerging evidence that exercise snacking may be feasible for enhancing muscle mass, strength and function [ 11 , 12 , 13 ]. One study in 20 older adults reported an adherence rate of 98% and improvements in lower body muscle (mean change 8 repetitions) in the 60-s sit-to-stand performance when undertaking a 4-week, twice-daily exercise snacking program, with no adverse events reported [ 11 ]. To our knowledge, only one qualitative study has explored the barriers and enablers to participating in an exercise snacking program [ 14 ]. Thirty-one healthy inactive adults aged 21–71\xa0years reported that greater flexibility, convenience, and easier integration into activities of daily living were enablers to facilitate adherence in a five day only exercise snacking program. Furthermore, participants in that study reported that using digital health technologies to deliver and monitor an exercise snacking program with reminders would facilitate adherence [ 14 ]. Therefore, exercise snacking delivered and monitored using digital health technologies may be an acceptable strategy for engaging older adults to participate in home-based exercise programs. We recently conducted the first trial to evaluate the feasibility of an individualised, home-based, asynchronously supervised exercise snacking program involving two to four daily exercise snacks in 15 community-dwelling older men and women aged 65–89\xa0years with at least one chronic health condition. Our study reported an adherence rate of 115% to this 12-week exercise snacking program delivered and monitored via an Amazon Alexa Echo Show 5 (Alexa) by an accredited exercise physiologist, with no intervention-related adverse events reported [ 15 ]. The aim of this nested qualitative study was to explore the enablers and barriers of participating in a home-based, brief (≤\u200910\xa0min) but frequent (2–4 times per day) exercise snacking program after 12\xa0weeks delivered and monitored by Alexa. Materials and methods Design This qualitative study used an interpretive description qualitative design to conduct semi-structured interviews following a 12-week exercise snacking pilot study in 15 adults aged 60–89\xa0years with at least one chronic condition. The period of recruitment for the 12-week pilot study was August 25th to September 3rd 2020 [ 15 ] with the last participant completing their 12-week semi-structured interview for this qualitative study on the 23rd December 2020. Qualitative interview data were analysed for all 15 participants that provided consent. We used the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Studies to report this study [ 16 ]. The study was approved by the Deakin University Human Research Ethics Committee (2020–166). Participants We used purposive sampling to recruit 15 participants from our pilot study [ 15 ], who were previous participants of exercise trials at Deakin University who provided consent to be re-contacted for future trials, as described in detail previously [ 15 ]. Participants were eligible to participate in the study if they were aged 60–89, English-speaking, living alone, had access to a home Wi-Fi network, and were cognitively and physically able to safely complete a remotely monitored and delivered 12-week exercise snacking program. Further detail on the eligibility criteria, recruitment strategy and quantitative outcomes for this study are available in the previous article [ 15 ]. Intervention All participants completed an initial consult with the accredited exercise physiologist via telephone to discuss exercise preferences/barriers and set a personalised exercise snacking program. The peak exercise professionals in Australia are referred to as ‘accredited exercise physiologists’. These professionals undertake a minimum 4-year university course and are qualified allied health professionals equipped with the knowledge, skills and competencies to design, deliver and evaluate safe and effective exercise interventions for people with acute, sub-acute or chronic medical conditions, injuries or disabilities. Participants were then prescribed an individualised, 12-week, home based, bodyweight only, brief and frequent (≤\u200910\xa0min of exercises progressing from two to four times per day over 12\xa0weeks), remotely delivered and monitored exercise snacking program by an Alexa, as previously described [ 15 ]. The protocol initially delivered two ‘exercise snacks’ per day for the first four weeks of the intervention, three snacks per day for the second four weeks, and four snacks per day for the final four weeks. Each exercise snack was prescribed by an accredited exercise physiologist based on the Osteo-cise: Strong Bones for Life program [ 17 ]. Each snack consisted of four bodyweight exercises (e.g. modified bench push up, squat with no arm support, vertical jump on the spot and four point kneeling with alternative arm and leg extension) from a battery of exercises performed for 10-repetitions and with 30-s rest between each exercise. Each exercise snack was individually broadcasted using video demonstrations, and audio and written instructions via Alexa at specified times based on participant preference and distributed evenly throughout the day (see example of an individualised exercise snacking program in Fig. 1 ). Fig. 1 An example of an exercise snack delivered and monitored entirely remotely Full size image Data collection At follow-up, semi-structured interviews were conducted via videoconferencing by a study investigator (PJ) with expertise and experience in qualitative research [ 18 , 19 ]. A set list of questions was designed to elicit responses to identify enablers and barriers of participating in the home-based exercise snacking intervention (S1). The study investigator asked further questions where necessary to clarify or obtain further information based on participant responses. All interviews were digitally voice recorded and were transcribed verbatim by a transcribing company ( www.transcribeme.com TranscribeMe Inc). Data analysis NVivo computer software (version 11, QSR International Pty Ltd, Doncaster, Victoria, Australia) was used to code the data and develop categories and themes. The six-stage process of thematic analysis as described by Braun & Clarke was used to analyse the data [ 20 ]. Data analysis was carried out by PJ (an accredited exercise physiologist who prescribed the exercise program) and JF with any disagreement resolved by DS. Results Participants were 15 older adults, aged 65 to 79\xa0years (mean age 70.3\xa0years) with 60% (9/15) women. All participants reported at least one chronic condition, including hypercholesteraemia (53%, 8/15), hypertension (47%, 7/15), diabetes (40%, 6/15), osteoarthritis (40%, 6/15), any type of cancer (20%, 3/15), coronary heart disease (13%, 2/15), and asthma (13%, 2/15). Only one participant (6.7%) reported having a fall in the last 12\xa0months. Seven key themes were identified from the analysis of the semi-structured interviews, which are depicted in Fig. 2 as intrinsic and extrinsic enablers and barriers to participation in home-based exercise snacking. Themes including time efficiency, flexibility, perceived health benefits, and motivation were enablers for participation in exercise snacking. A lack of upper body exercise and omission of exercise equipment, and a lack of time and motivation for completing exercise snacks more than three times per day, were barriers to participation. Fig. 2 Enablers and barriers of participating in a home-based pragmatic exercise snacking program Full size image Theme 1: Enablers of participating in an exercise snacking program Flexibility Participants reported positive feelings towards the flexible nature of the ‘exercise snacking’ approach. Participants established a routine easily at home and integrated their exercise snacking program around their own activities of daily living. Some participants mentioned that the exercise snacks could be completed at any time of day, which allowed the exercise snacking approach to conveniently fit into their lives. “The flexibility of a(n) [exercise] snacking was very good.” (Participant 8, female, age 67). “If I wanted to do it four times a day–it doesn’t have to be two in the morning, two in the afternoon at a certain time. You pace at your own–there were times I did three lots, starting from seven in the morning until 10, and then the last one before I went to bed because I had to get out and do other things during the day. So you could pace it when you’re available.” (Participant 8, female, age 67). Time efficiency Participants identified that it was time efficient to participate in the program since it involved only brief (≤\u200910\xa0min) exercise snacks. Some participants reported that distributing exercise into shorter but more frequent sessions each day was more acceptable than longer and less frequent exercise sessions, which are consistent with current exercise guidelines for older adults with chronic conditions [ 3 ]. “The snacking is a good concept, I think. It’s short and fast.” (Participant 15, female, age 74). “I think it was a really, really good way to (get) you to do exercise because not everyone wants to get up and exercise for half an hour or an hour. And to be able to do it in little, short bursts I think is really beneficial.” (Participant 7, female, age 67). Motivation The pragmatic nature of the exercise snacking program provided motivation to participate in the exercise program. Participants reported that the exercise snacking program allowed them to feel a sense of achievement because it was easy (or easier) to achieve. “I did triple what you would expect, like instead of 10 I’d do 30 (repetitions). But I really think it was good having four different exercises each time.” (Participant 9, female, age 65). “Yeah, because it’s do-able and there’s nothing stopping you from doing it more, or even repeating it if you wish to, or doing it faster.” (Participant 8, female, age 67). “Yeah. So you’re in control. It just gave you the basic guidelines, which were not putting any pressure really, and if you wished to increase it, you could.” (Participant 8, female, age 67). Some participants reported that gradually increasing the frequency of the exercise snacks (e.g. twice per day for the first four weeks of the intervention, three times per day for the second four weeks, and four times per day for the final four weeks) may facilitate greater adherence. “The design of the exercise is excellent. I mean the first month I do two sets of exercises and the second month three sets and the fourth and then the third month, four sets of exercises. At the beginning when I did the two sets, I thought; oh, how will I be able to do the four sets? But when I came to the four sets, it wasn't difficult for me.” (Participant 10, male, age 66). Having an accredited exercise physiologist prescribe the individualised exercise snacking program was perceived to improve adherence by contributing to accountability, exercise progression, and safety. “The degree of the exercises was just, yeah it was doable. I was a bit afraid that you’ll (accredited exercise physiologist) make it too difficult and then I can’t do it anymore, there has to be challenge in it and it has to be just right, as Goldilocks says.” (Participant 3, female, age 67). “I’m pleased that I had some exercises in a programmed and personal way to do, otherwise I’d just be sitting watching TV all day, or whatever. So that was very helpful.” (Participant 6, male, age 77). Perceived health benefits Some participants reported desired and perceived positive health benefits associated with participation in the exercise snacking program, including improvements in pain, balance, flexibility, and strength. “Okay. I found that I did become more flexible over time and I had a lot of problems with my knee, although there were some exercises I couldn't do because of it that were on the program but I did find that I felt that I became a lot more flexible and in general my knee became less painful.” (Participant 2, female, age 66). “I’m hoping that I’ve built extra fitness over 12\xa0weeks. Particularly balance, it’s not so much fitness, it’s balance that’s something that’s probably important for people in my demographic to be able to not fall over. And certainly, that balance with head turn is challenging. I need a finger that I can grab something if need be.” (Participant 15, female, age 74). “I found out that my knees sort of work—well, not sort of, they work better now after the exercises.” (Participant 10, male, age 66). Furthermore, some participants reported positive mental benefits from the ‘exercise snacking’ program, that included improvements in their emotional state. “But overall it is—discipline helps to achieve what you would like to achieve and that’s what—I feel better and yeah, so I definitely felt physical exercise helped to sort you out emotionally, it stabilises emotions.” (Participant 3, female, age 67). “The positive thing is well that you definitely realise after, I would say after six weeks I would say I realised that I get stronger. I have known my whole life, it enhances your mood if you do regular exercises.” (Participant 3, female, age 67). Theme 2: Barriers to participation in an exercise snacking intervention Lack of time Some participants reported lack of time as an extrinsic barrier to participating in an ‘exercise snacking’ program, particularly when completing more than three ‘exercise snacks’ per day. “The main time I enjoyed when it was—like, when I had to do it two or three times in the day. I found the fourth time, particularly at this point of time in the year, a bit challenging, really challenging. Not from a physical point of view but from a time point of view. Like, with Christmas, with Christmas shopping and Christmas—and the grandchildren dropping in, us driving down to the beach house to be with the rest of the family, it’s just like so difficult, the four sessions. I think personally for me I would find the reminders, two reminders a day really worked well and then half the time when it got to three or four—mainly four in the last four weeks I’d think, have I done it three times or have I done it four times?” (Participant 12, female age 68). “We stuck to three exercises per day. When it got to four, it got a little bit time-critical, and because things have now opened-up post-pandemic, there are other things to do. I had to, not race through them, but perhaps do two lots in the morning, and then two lots in the afternoon to accomplish the four sessions. In other words, I wasn’t able to neatly space them throughout the day. There’s just too many other things going on. Sometimes I was just unable to do them at all, I was away visiting my daughter in the country. But on the whole, I think I did about 99% of them all, I did miss out on a few.” (Participant 6, male, age 77). “Yeah, that starts to get a little bit onerous, only because just at this time of the year there’s just so many things that are happening. I got a little bit lost towards the end there, but I mean that was something that was my fault, nothing to do with the program as such I think. A different time, a different time of the year I think I’d be more comfortable with it.” (Participant 14, male, age 74). “ I couldn’t do four. I couldn’t fit in four. Hard enough doing two.” (Participant 13, female, age 66). “ Yeah. I found that two is enough because to try and fit it in and then to make sure that you fit it in, then it becomes taking over your schedule, your time, and then it’s not just—you want to get up and do some exercise and then do it later. Then it just sort of takes over and becomes inconvenient.” (Participant 13, female, age 66). Lack of motivation to participate in more than three sessions per day Some participants reported a lack of motivation as an intrinsic barrier to participating in the ‘exercise snacking’ program, particularly when undertaking more than three sessions per day. “Yeah, look, definitely four didn’t suit me. I struggled not so much physically, although it got boring. That was part of it. I just didn’t—my heart wasn’t in the [first] one, number one. Number two, I could never remember whether I had done three or four. And number three, it just was the wrong time of the year. So yeah, I didn’t like the last [lot]. I tried. I tried really hard but I didn’t like—wasn’t particularly engaged in that last—the [fourth] one.” (Participant 12, female age 68). Lack of upper body exercise and equipment in a home-based bodyweight program Participants reported that the lack of both upper body exercises and equipment were barriers to participating in the ‘exercise snacking’ program, which was lower limb focussed and involved only bodyweight exercises. “I didn’t think there were enough upper body exercises and there could have been a couple more they put in.” (Participant 5, female, age 79). “I know the hand you’ve got push-ups, but you don’t have weights” (Participant 1, male, age 70). “Now, I don’t have any exercise for the hands. Now, with the hand, as you know, we should have weights, anything—two bottles, two milk cartons for argument’s sake two kilo each hand, or the rubber stretching rubber exercise to whatever.” (Participant 1, male, age 70). Discussion This nested qualitative analysis demonstrated that exercise snacking performed multiple times per day may be a feasible strategy for engaging older adults to participate in home-based exercise programs that are both delivered and monitored via an Alexa [ 15 ]. Participants reported themes relating to flexibility, time efficiency, and motivation as enablers for participation in the exercise snacking program. Conversely, participants reported some barriers associated with the ‘exercise snacking’ program, including the lack of upper body exercises, omission of exercise equipment, and a lack of time and motivation when exercise snacks were prescribed three or more times per day. Our qualitative analyses revealed enablers related to flexibility and time efficiency associated with participation in the exercise snacking program. Some participants noted that distributing exercise into shorter but more frequent sessions each day was more acceptable than longer non-consecutive exercise sessions which are consistent with current exercise guidelines for older adults with chronic conditions [ 3 ]. These enablers were similar to those reported in the only other qualitative study exploring the barriers and enablers to participating in exercise snacking exercises. [ 14 ]. Participants in that study reported various enablers to participation in the exercise snacking program, including that it could be completed at any time of day and integrated into their own activities of daily living [ 14 ]. Another study evaluating the experiences in 38 community-dwelling older adults participating in an exercise snacking program revealed similar enablers related to flexibility and time efficiency [ 12 ]. The reason(s) for poor engagement with current exercise guidelines for older adults are multifactorial but include a high perceived difficulty and/or complexity, time constraints, limited access to facilities, and cost [ 21 , 22 ]. It is possible that exercise snacking approaches could minimise these barriers for older adults. Future comparative qualitative studies are required to compare, and identify the determinants of, adherence to ‘exercise snacking’ program versus programs consistent with current exercise guidelines for older adults (e.g. American College of Sport Medicine) [ 3 ]. Participants in our study reported themes suggesting they favoured the brief but frequent nature of the exercise snacking intervention, which may have positively influenced their adherence to the program. It is possible that the shorter exercise snacks were perceived to be, and/or were, more achievable for this group of older adults. Participants in our study reported themes related to Bandura's social–cognitive theory of self-efficacy (i.e. people will choose to participate in a behaviour based on their expectation about their own ability to perform the behaviour) [ 23 ]. Therefore, participants in our study appeared to be willing to participate in the exercise snacking program based on self-efficacy that they would be able to complete the task prescribed. A cross-sectional study exploring self-efficacy in older adults found that greater levels of self-efficacy predicted participation in at least 20\xa0min of continuous physical activity [ 24 ]. Furthermore, a qualitative study of 19 older men found those with a higher self-efficacy for participation in a supervised weekly exercise program had a greater ability to overcome barriers and prevent relapses [ 25 ]. Our main trial did not include a measure of self-efficacy associated with the exercise snacking program [ 15 ]; however it seems exercise snacks were perceived to be, and/or were, more achievable compared to other exercise prescriptions for older adults. Some participants reported positive health benefits associated with the exercise snacking program, including improvements in pain, balance, flexibility, and strength, which were identified as enablers to their participation. These observations are consistent with the health beliefs model [ 26 ] whereby the perceived health benefits of an intervention predicts the likelihood of engaging in the associated intervention behaviours. A qualitative study involving sedentary older adults reported that perceived mental and physical health benefits provided motivation to complete 30\xa0min of continuous moderate intensity physical activity on most days of the week [ 27 ]. However, the present study is the first we are aware of to demonstrate this finding in a brief (≤\u200910\xa0min) but frequent (2–4 times per day) exercise snacking program. Nevertheless, despite the pragmatic characteristics of the exercise snacking intervention, participants still perceived there to be positive benefits, and this may have contributed to the mean adherence (115%) to the exercise over 12\xa0weeks [ 15 ]. Older adults in our study reported the lack of equipment used in the exercise snacking program as an extrinsic barrier to participation. The previous trial of home-based exercise snacking in 38 community-dwelling older adults similarly observed barriers related to the lack of additional exercise variety, equipment and upper body exercises [ 12 ]. These barriers were inconsistent to those reported in the only other qualitative study exploring the barriers and enablers to participating in exercise snacking exercises [ 14 ]. Participants in that study reported various enablers to participation in the exercise snacking program, including that it could be completed with no specialised equipment [ 14 ]. However, participants in our study may have felt after several weeks they felt familiar with, or insufficiently challenged by the body weight only 12-week exercise program. A qualitative study in older adults with chronic conditions found that home-based program participants reported that lack of access to exercise equipment, or not having the space to use their own exercise equipment, were associated with poorer adherence [ 19 ]. Gym participants in that study also reported that the equipment provided feedback to obtain further physical improvements (e.g. progressively increasing the resistance in a pin loaded knee extension machine), which may have also reinforced their motivation to continue to exercise [ 19 ]. Providing exercise equipment may provide a means to improve feedback, and support adherence and motivation in future home-based exercise snacking trials. There is evidence to support our finding that some older adults report extrinsic barriers, such as a lack of time, to participation in home-based exercise. For example, a qualitative study involving sedentary older adults allocated to a home-based program, found that work and carer commitments were an environmental barrier to completing 30\xa0min of moderate intensity physical activity on most days of the week [ 27 ]. A recent systematic review exploring barriers and facilitators to physical activity participation in older adults reported that in 40% of studies participants reported work and family responsibilities as barriers to recommended levels of physical activity [ 28 ]. Some participants in our study reported lack of motivation as an intrinsic barrier to participating in the exercise snacking program, particularly when exercise snacks were prescribed more than three times per day. Nevertheless, these barriers seemingly did not impact our participants’ mean adherence (115%) to the exercise intervention over 12\xa0weeks. Some participants in our study reported themes related to self-determination theory [ 29 ] where they demonstrated the importance of autonomy to foster motivation and engagement with their prescribed exercise snacking program. It is possible that establishing individual preferences for participating in an exercise snacking program completed more than three times per day (e.g. performing two consecutive exercise snacks twice per day instead of evenly distributing four exercise snacks throughout the day) may alleviate some of these concerns in future exercise snacking trials. Strengths of this study include the prescription of individualised and progressive exercise snacks delivered using a novel digital platform requiring minimal technology familiarity. Further longer term studies are required to determine the effectiveness and acceptability of exercise snacking programs in older adults when delivered and monitored remotely via different platforms, given it is likely that there is no single platform that meets the needs, preferences and technological literacy of all older adults; indeed, our previous study demonstrated that some participants would prefer a similar intervention delivered by platforms other than Alexa [ 30 ]. A limitation of this study may be selection bias because participants may have had positive feelings towards exercise trials given we recruited previous research participants who provided consent to be re-contacted for future trials. Data analysis was carried out by the accredited exercise physiologist who prescribed the exercise program which may have contributed to investigator bias. This study was conducted during the COVID-19 lockdowns/restrictions and our findings may not be representative of the experiences of participants in our trial outside this period of time. Conclusion This qualitative study identified themes including time efficiency, flexibility, perceived health benefits and motivation as enablers for participation in the exercise snacking program. Future trials should consider providing exercise equipment, incorporate whole-body exercises, and establish participant preferences on achieving three or more exercise snacks per day.
