Exercise snacks seem to be well tolerated and can offset the detrimental effects of prolonged sitting on metabolic outcomes and vascular function. Inactivity is associated with increased all-cause mortality and cardiovascular disease risk."

Reflective processes are often a better predictor of deliberative snacking, whereas impulsive processes are a stronger predictor of spontaneous snacking. We conclude with a discussion of how exercise motivation can influence snacking behavior and how it can be used to help people achieve their long-term goals."

The evidence indicates that micro-Finance programmes which build social capital can indeed make a significant contribution to women’s empowerment. However, serious questions need to be asked about what sorts of norms, networks and associations are to be promoted, in whose interests, and how they can best contribute to empowerment, particularly for the poorest women.

But a trend was noted for superiority of heavy loading with respect to these outcome measures with null findings likely attributed to a relatively small number of studies on the topic. The mean ES for low loads was 1.23 ± 0.43 (CI: 0.32, 2.13). The meanES for high loads was 2.30± 0. 43 ( CI: 1.41, 3.19)."
